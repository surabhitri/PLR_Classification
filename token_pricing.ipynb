For example, the market value\\nof property can be assumed for purposes of a ruling, subject to verification when the return is audited. Indeed, the IRS often\\nconditions rulings on subsequent determinations by examining agents that payments or other transfers are reasonable in amount\\nand are what they purport to be. Moreover, the policy against ruling on “alternative plans of proposed transactions” does not\\npreclude a taxpayer from modifying a proposed transaction to eliminate or modify a feature on discovering that it may elicit an\\nadverse ruling. 73  The policy against ruling on “hypothetical situations” does not, for example, preclude a ruling on a transaction\\nthat will be consummated only if blessed by a favorable ruling. 74\\nIn addition to the general areas described above, the IRS annually provides a list of particular issues on which it either will\\nnot or “ordinarily” will not rule, 75  most of which involve factual questions that are better handled “by an agent examining\\nthe taxpayer's return than by a tax law specialist sitting at a desk in Washington.” 76  The no-ruling list includes, for example,\\nwhether compensation is reasonable in amount, whether the cost of an item usually used for personal pleasure (e.g., a swimming\\npool) can be deducted as a medical expense, and whether an acquisition was made to evade or avoid tax within the meaning of §\\n269. 77  The qualified embargo (“will not ordinarily rule”) covers many questions that to the outsider differ only imperceptibly\\nfrom those covered by the absolute embargo, including the ownership of property where title is in a person other than the alleged\\ntrue owner and whether indebtedness is incurred or carried to purchase or continue an investment in tax-exempt bonds. 78\\nFinally, rulings typically conclude with a disclaimer similar to the following:\\nThe rulings contained in this letter are based upon information and representations submitted by the taxpayer and accompanied\\nby a penalty of perjury statement executed by an appropriate party. While this office has not verified any of the material submitted\\nin support of the request for rulings, it is subject to verification on examination.\\nExcept as expressly provided herein, no opinion is expressed or implied concerning the tax consequences of any aspect of any\\ntransaction or item discussed or referenced in this letter. 79\\n5. Oral advice. The IRS does not issue oral rulings or accept oral requests for rulings, but IRS personnel do discuss with\\ntaxpayers and their representatives the availability of IRS rulings in particular situations and other procedural questions relating\\nto rulings requests. 80  Also, at the IRS's “discretion” and “as time permits,” IRS personnel may discuss substantive issues, but\\nstatements made in these discussions are not binding on the IRS, and taxpayers may not rely on them, even as a basis for relief\\nfrom retroactive effect of an inconsistent written ruling later issued to the taxpayer. 81  The IRS “does not respond to letters\\nseeking to confirm the substance of oral discussions, and the absence of a response to such a letter is not a confirmation.” 82\\nMore generally, oral “guidance is advisory only, and the Service is not bound by it, for example, when examining the taxpayer's\\nreturn.” 83\\n110.6.3 Reliance on and Revocation of Unpublished Guidance\\n\""
