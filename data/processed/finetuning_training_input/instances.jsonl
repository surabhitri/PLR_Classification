Taxpayer is a wholly-owned subsidiary of A and joins in the consolidated \nFederal income tax return filed for the affiliated group headed by A.  A files its \nconsolidated Federal income tax return on a calendar year basis.\nPLR-132858-12\n2\nTaxpayer owns certain improved real property located at Taxpayer\u2019s B plant in \nCity1, State1 (the \u201cB property\u201d).  The B property contains certain depreciable real \nproperty that is section 1250 property.  Most of this section 1250 property has been fully \ndepreciated.  Hereinafter, the fully depreciated B property that is section 1250 property \nwill be referred to as \u201cthe Property.\u201d\nTaxpayer intends to contribute some or all of the Property to one or more \norganizations that are exempt from Federal income tax under section 501(c)(3) as a \ncharitable contribution under section 170.  Moreover, Taxpayer intends to claim a \ncharitable deduction under section 170 with respect to its contribution of the Property to \none or more section 501(c)(3) tax-exempt organizations.\nTaxpayer represents that these section 501(c)(3) tax-exempt organizations will \nhave the same basis in the Property as Taxpayer will have at the time of the transfer \npursuant to section 1015(a).\nRULING REQUESTED\nTaxpayer requests the following ruling:\nIf the Property is contributed to one or more section 501(c)(3) tax-exempt \norganizations, the charitable deduction attributable to the value of the \ncontribution will not be reduced by twenty percent of the accumulated \ndepreciation of the Property pursuant to section 291(a)(1).\nLAW AND ANALYSIS\nSection 170 generally allows a deduction, subject to certain limitations, for \ncharitable contributions made during the taxable year to or for the use of organizations \ndescribed in section 170(c), including section 501(c)(3) organizations.\nSection 170A-1(c)(1) of the Income Tax Regulations provides that if a charitable \ncontribution is made in property other than money, the amount of the contribution is the \nfair market value of the property at the time of the contribution, reduced as provided in \nsection 170(e)(1) and section 1.170A-4(a), or section 170(e)(3) and section 1.170A-\n4A(c).\nSection 170(e)(1) provides that the amount of any charitable contribution of \nproperty otherwise taken into account under section 170 shall be reduced by, among \nother amounts, the amount of gain that would not have been long-term capital gain \n(determined without regard to section 1221(b)(3)) if the property contributed had been\nsold by the taxpayer at its fair market value (determined at the time of such \ncontribution).\nPLR-132858-12\n3\nSection 1.170A-4(a)(1) provides that in the case of a contribution by an individual \nor by a corporation of ordinary income property, as defined in section 1.170A-4(b)(1), \nthe amount of the charitable contribution that would be taken into account under section \n170(a) without regard to section 170(e) shall be reduced before applying the percentage \nlimitations under section 170(b) by the amount of gain that would have been recognized \nas gain that is not long-term capital gain if the property had been sold by the donor at its \nfair market value at the time of its contribution to the charitable organization.\nSection 1.170A-4(b)(1) defines the term \u201cordinary income property\u201d as meaning \nproperty any portion of the gain on which would not have been long-term capital gain if \nthe property had been sold by the donor at its fair market value at the time of its \ncontribution to the charitable organization.\nSection 291(a)(1) provides that in a case where a corporation disposes of section \n1250 property, an amount equal to twenty percent of the excess, if any, of (A) the \namount that would be treated as ordinary income if such property was section 1245 \nproperty, over (B) the amount treated as ordinary income under section 1250 \n(determined without regard to section 291(a)(1)), shall be treated as gain which is \nordinary income under section 1250 and shall be recognized notwithstanding any other \nprovision of Subtitle A of the Code.  Section 291(a)(1) further provides that under \nregulations prescribed by the Secretary, the provisions of section 291(a)(1) will not \napply to the disposition of any property to the extent that section 1250(a) does not apply \nto such disposition by reason of section 1250(d).\nIf section 1245 property is disposed of, section 1245(a)(1) generally provides that \nthe amount by which the lower of (A) the recomputed basis of the property, or (B) the \namount realized (in the case of a sale, exchange, or involuntary conversion) or the fair \nmarket value of such property (in the case of any other disposition), exceeds the \nadjusted basis of such property is treated as ordinary income.  Such gain is recognized \nnotwithstanding any other provision of Subtitle A of the Code.\nSection 1245(a)(2) defines the term \u201crecomputed basis\u201d with respect to any \nproperty as meaning, generally, its adjusted basis recomputed by adding thereto all \nadjustments reflected in such adjusted basis on account of deductions (whether in \nrespect of the same or other property) allowed or allowable to the taxpayer or to any \nother person for depreciation or amortization.   \nIf section 1250 property is disposed of after December 31, 1975, section \n1250(a)(1)(A) generally provides that 100 percent of the lower of (i) that portion of the \nadditional depreciation attributable to periods after December 31, 1975, in respect of \nsuch property, or (ii) the excess of the amount realized (in the case of a sale, exchange, \nor involuntary conversion), or the fair market value of such property (in the case of any \nother disposition), over the adjusted basis of such property, is treated as gain that is \nPLR-132858-12\n4\nordinary income.  Such gain is recognized notwithstanding any other provision of \nSubtitle A of the Code.\nSection 1250(b)(1) defines the term \u201cadditional depreciation\u201d as meaning, in the \ncase of any property, the depreciation adjustments in respect of such property; except \nthat, in the case of property held more than one year, it means such adjustments only to \nthe extent that they exceed the amount of the depreciation adjustments that would have \nresulted if such adjustments had been determined for each taxable year under the \nstraight-line method of depreciation.\nSection 1250(d)(1) provides that section 1250(a) shall not apply to a disposition \nby gift.\nSection 1.1250-3(a)(1) provides that, for purposes of section 1250(d)(1), the term \n\u201cgift\u201d shall have the same meaning as in section 1.1245-4(a).\nSection 1.1245-4(a) provides that the term \u201cgift\u201d means, generally, a transfer of \nproperty which, in the hands of the transferee, has a basis determined under the \nprovisions of section 1015(a) or (d) (relating to basis of property acquired by gifts).\nIf section 1250 property is disposed of by gift (as defined in sections 1.1250-\n3(a)(1) and 1.1245-4(a)), section 1250(d)(1) provides that section 1250(a) does not \napply to such disposition.  Consequently, section 291(a)(1) would not apply to a gift (as \ndefined in sections 1.1250-3(a)(1) and 1.1245-4(a)) of section 1250 property.  \nIn this case, Taxpayer represents that it intends to contribute the Property to one \nor more organizations that are section 501(c)(3) tax-exempt organizations, that this \nintended contribution will be a valid charitable contribution that meets the requirements \nof section 170, and that these section 501(c)(3) tax-exempt organizations will have a \nbasis in the Property equal to Taxpayer\u2019s basis in the Property at the time of transfer \npursuant to section 1015(a).  These are material representations.  Because the basis of \nthe Property in the hands of the section 501(c)(3) tax-exempt organizations will be the \nsame as Taxpayer\u2019s basis in the Property at the time of the transfer pursuant to section \n1015(a), the contribution of the Property by Taxpayer to the section 501(c)(3) \norganizations is a gift for purposes of sections 1250(d)(1) and 1.1250-3(a)(1).  \nAccordingly, the provisions of section 291(a)(1) will not apply to Taxpayer\u2019s disposition \nof the Property to the section 501(c)(3) tax-exempt organizations.\nCONCLUSION\nBased solely on Taxpayer\u2019s representations and the relevant law and analysis \nset forth above, we conclude that if the Property is contributed to one or more section \n501(c)(3) tax-exempt organizations, the charitable deduction attributable to the value of \nPLR-132858-12\n5\nthe contribution will not be reduced by twenty percent of the accumulated depreciation \nof the Property pursuant to section 291(a)(1).\nExcept as specifically set forth above, no opinion is expressed or implied \nconcerning the tax consequences of the facts described above under any other \nprovisions of the Code.  Specifically, this letter ruling is based upon Taxpayer\u2019s \ndescription of the proposed contribution of property to certain section 501(c)(3) \norganizations.  This letter ruling does not address whether the proposed contribution is \na valid charitable contribution that meets the requirements of section 170.  Further, the \namount of the deduction for the proposed contribution is outside the scope of this letter \nruling, and no approval of the amount should be inferred from this letter ruling.  \nMoreover, no opinion is expressed or implied on (i) whether any of the property located \nat B is section 1250 property, and (ii) the propriety of Taxpayer\u2019s methods of \ndepreciating the property located at B.\nThis letter ruling is directed only to the taxpayer requesting it.  Section 6110(k)(3) \nprovides that it may not be used or cited as precedent.\nIn accordance with the power of attorney, we are sending a copy of this letter to \nTaxpayer\u2019s authorized representatives.  We are also sending a copy of this letter to the \nappropriate operating division director.\nSincerely,\nKathleen Reed\nKathleen Reed\nChief, Branch 7\nOffice of Associate Chief Counsel\n(Income Tax and Accounting)\nEnclosures (2):\ncopy of this letter\ncopy for section 6110 purposes \n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Non-Adverse"}]}

Pursuant to X=s \nwill, the executor of the Estate will give certain bequests of cash and personal property \nto individual named beneficiaries.  Any residual estate remaining is to be divided equally \nand distributed to ten named charitable organizations, each of which is represented as \nbeing an organization described in ' 501(c)(3) (collectively, the Charities). \n \n \nPLR-137172-03 \n \n2 \nArticle VIII of X=s will grants the executor of the Estate the power to make \ndistribution or division of the Estate in cash or in kind, or both; to allot different kinds or \ndisproportionate shares of property or undivided interests in property among the \nbeneficiaries, and to determine the value of any such property; and to make such \nelections under the tax laws applicable to the Estate as the executor determines should \nbe made.  No compensating adjustments between principal and income, nor with \nrespect to any bequest or devise, shall be made even though the elections so made \nmay affect (beneficially or adversely) the interests of the beneficiaries.  \n \nAt the time of X=s death, X owned a non-qualified annuity contract (the Contract), \nwhich had a basis in X=s hands of $x and a value of $y as of D1 of Year 1.  The Contract \nwas purchased after October 21, 1979.  No payments had been received by X under \nthe Contract.  The named beneficiary of the death benefit under the Contract is the \nEstate.  The Estate surrendered the Contract on D2 of Year 1 for $z.  The difference \nbetween $y and $z represents interest accrued after the death of X.  The Estate has not \nincluded any amount in its gross income or taken any income tax deduction with respect \nto the Contract for any taxable year.  The Estate has made interim distributions \nsatisfying all specific and pecuniary bequests.  The amounts received upon surrender of \nthe Contract will be distributed as part of the remaining residuary bequest to the \nCharities, which have also received interim cash distributions.   \n \n \nThe Estate has filed its income tax returns for all taxable years on a fiscal year \nending D1, which is not the last day of any month. \n \n \nSection 441(a) provides that taxable income shall be computed on the basis of \nthe taxpayer\u2019s taxable year.  In general, an estate may adopt a calendar year or a fiscal \nyear.  Section 441(e) defines a fiscal year as a period of twelve months ending on the \nlast day of any month other than December. \n \n \nSection 642(c)(1) provides that in the case of an estate, there shall be allowed as \na deduction in computing its taxable income (in lieu of the deduction allowed by             \n\u00a7 170(a), relating to deduction for charitable, etc., contributions and gifts) any amount of \nthe gross income, without limitation, which pursuant to the terms of the governing \ninstrument is, during the taxable year, paid for a purpose specified in ' 170(c) \n(determined without regard to \u00a7 170(c)(2)(A)). \n \n \nSection 642(c)(2) provides that in the case of an estate, there shall be allowed as \na deduction in computing its taxable income any amount of the gross income, without \nlimitation, which pursuant to the terms of the governing instrument is, during the taxable \nyear, permanently set aside for a purpose specified in \u00a7 170(c), or is to be used \nexclusively for religious, charitable, scientific, literary, or educational purposes, or for the \nprevention of cruelty to children or animals, or for the establishment, acquisition, \nmaintenance, or operation of a public cemetery not operated for profit. \n \n \nPLR-137172-03 \n \n3 \nSection 691(a)(1) provides that the amount of all items of gross income in \nrespect of a decedent which are not properly includible in respect of the taxable period \nin which falls the date of the decedent=s death or a prior period (including the amount of \nall items of gross income in respect of a prior decedent, if the right to receive such \namount was acquired by reason of the death of the prior decedent or by bequest, \ndevise, or inheritance from the prior decedent) shall be included in the gross income, for \nthe taxable year when received, of: (A) the estate of the decedent, if the right to receive \nthe amount is acquired by the decedent=s estate from the decedent; (B) the person who, \nby reason of the death of the decedent, acquires the right to receive the amount, if the \nright to receive the amount is not acquired by the decedent=s estate from the decedent; \nor (C) the person who acquires from the decedent the right to receive the amount by \nbequest, devise, or inheritance, if the amount is received after a distribution by the \ndecedent=s estate of such right. \n \n \nRev. Rul. 2005-30, 2005-20 I.R.B. 1015, holds that if the owner-annuitant of a \ndeferred annuity contract dies before the annuity starting date, and the beneficiary \nreceives a death benefit under the annuity contract, the amount received by the \nbeneficiary in a lump sum in excess of the owner-annuitant\u2019s investment in the contract \nis includible in the beneficiary\u2019s gross income as IRD within the meaning of \u00a7 691.  Rev. \nRul. 2005-30 applies to deferred annuity contracts purchased on or after October 21, \n1979. \n \nBased solely on the facts and representations submitted, we conclude that the \nexcess of $y over $x received by the Estate (as the named beneficiary of the Contract) \nupon the surrender of the Contract was IRD includible by the Estate in its Year 1 gross \nincome.  The Estate is entitled to a deduction under \u00a7 642(c)(1) for the amounts of IRD \npaid to the Charities in the Year 1 taxable year, or under \u00a7 642(c)(2) for the remaining \namounts of IRD which were set aside for charitable purposes.  We further conclude that \nthe Estate has not filed its income tax returns based on an allowable taxable year under \n\u00a7 441. \n \n \nThe Estate must file amended income tax returns for all taxable years based \nupon an allowable taxable year.  Those returns, as amended, must include the IRD in \nthe Estate\u2019s gross income and claim the appropriate deduction under \u00a7 642(c).  A copy \nof this letter should be attached to each return.  \n \nExcept as specifically set forth above, no opinion is expressed concerning the \nfederal tax consequences of the transactions described above. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPLR-137172-03 \n \n4 \n \nThis ruling is directed only to the taxpayer requesting it.

You \nrequested the following rulings concerning the tax treatment of certain escrow accounts \nrequired by and established pursuant to law:   \n \n \n(1) the escrow accounts that Company established with B pursuant to the D, are \nqualified settlement funds within the meaning of section 1.468B-1 of the Income Tax \nRegulations; \n \n \n(2) all payments made by Company to these escrow accounts are fully \ndeductible; \n \n \n(3) subsequent payments by Company made to these accounts and to other \naccounts set up with B or a similar financial institution pursuant to agreements entered \ninto with other Cs are deductible in the year deposited into escrow; \n \n \n(4) each escrow account is subject to tax on its modified gross income for any \ntaxable year at a rate equal to the maximum rate in effect for that taxable year under \nsection 1(e) of the Internal Revenue Code; and \n \n \n(5) transfers to the escrow accounts by Company will not constitute gross income \nto the accounts. \n \nA taxpayer conference of right was held on November 19, 2002.  An additional taxpayer \nconference was held on May 2, 2005. \n \nFACTS \n \n \nCompany is a public corporation engaged in the manufacture and wholesale \ndistribution of J G, a brand of G products, including F.  Company began operations in \nYear 1 as a contract manufacturer of G and F.  Company uses an accrual method of \naccounting.  Since Year 2, Company has engaged in extensive research and \ndevelopment activities relating to the development of its proprietary products utilizing its \npatented J technology. \n \n \nThe Cs brought a consolidated suit against the major manufacturers and sellers \n(manufacturers) of G products.  The suit asserted various claims for monetary, equitable \n \nPLR-124833-02 \n \n \n3 \nand injunctive relief under state laws, including consumer protection and/or antitrust \nlaws.  The Company was not a party defendant in the suit brought by the Cs against the \nmajor manufacturers of G products.  \n \n \n \nOn Date 1, the Cs entered into a settlement agreement, A, to resolve litigation \nagainst the major manufacturers of G products.  Under the A, the party defendant \nmanufacturers of G products are required to establish escrow accounts and make \nannual payments (in perpetuity) into escrow for the benefit of the Cs.  The A provides \nthat all payments are in settlement of H.  The party defendants\u2019 payments to the escrow \naccounts are determined by a formula based on their F sales.  In exchange for these \npayments, the defendant manufacturers of G products are \u201cabsolutely and \nunconditionally released and forever discharged from all claims that the Cs directly, \nindirectly, derivatively or in any other capacity ever had, now have, or hereafter can, \nshall or may have\u201d against the defendant manufacturers from liability relating to past, \npresent and certain future claims stemming from the use, sale, distribution, \nmanufacture, development, advertising, or marketing of F.  Under the A, these escrow \naccounts are expressly intended to be treated as qualified settlement funds for federal \nincome tax purposes. \n \n \nThe party defendant manufacturers believed that the manufacturers of G \nproducts not named as party defendants in litigation also contributed to the harms \nalleged by the Cs.  Consequently, the party defendant manufacturers of G products \ndemanded as a condition of the settlement that nonparty manufacturers of G products \nbe required to share the financial burdens and make deposits into escrows as well.  The \nCs agreed.  The Cs and the party defendant manufacturers structured their settlement \nto require nonparty manufacturers to contribute to the settlement in one of two ways.  In \nrelevant part, the A directs the Cs to require that certain nonparty manufacturers, of \nwhich Company is one, establish escrow accounts based on the same formula provided \nin the A.  The D was incorporated into and made an integral part of the A approved by \nthe court having jurisdiction.  Each C has enacted a law in the same or substantially \nsimilar form as the D.  \n \n \nThe objective of the D is to force nonparty manufacturers who refuse to opt into \nthe A to assume a share of the financial burdens created by the use of F and other G \nproducts.  The D applies to any nonparty manufacturer selling F within a C .  The \namount of a manufacturer\u2019s annual deposits into the escrow accounts required by the D \nare based on a manufacturer\u2019s sales of F during the year in question.  Any escrow \naccounts set up for this purpose must be approved by the Cs. \n \n \nCompany has refused to opt into the A.  Therefore, as a nonparty manufacturer \nof G products selling F within C, Company is required under the D to establish escrow \naccounts based on the same formula provided in the A.  \n \n \nPLR-124833-02 \n \n \n4 \n \n \nThe Cs have advised Company of its duty to deposit funds in accordance with  \nthe Ds and have made written demands for the deposits.  In Year 3, Company \nestablished the escrow accounts at B.  The escrow accounts at B were approved by the \nCs.  To date, Company has deposited a total of  $ X into escrow accounts in  accordance  \nwith the Ds.  As long as Company remains a manufacturer of G products, it will continue \nto be required to make annual deposits into such escrow accounts, either at B or similar \nfinancial institutions. \n \n \nOn or about Date 2, the L (one of the Cs referred to above) notified Company via \nletter of its intent to file a suit against Company in state court.  L alleges at least one \nclaim against Company asserting liability arising out of a violation of laws resulting from \nthe sale of G products and related actions.   \n \n \nCompany represents that pursuant to the Ds, it contributes to the escrow \naccounts held for the sole purpose of satisfying C (of which L is a party) claims.  The \nescrow accounts exist to satisfy C claims brought against Company within Number after \nthe date such fund is placed into escrow.  Company may not access the fund for any \npurpose other than satisfying C claims during the Number period.  Any remainder will \nrevert to Company.  Company expects that claims will be made against all the \ncontributed funds and, if successful, the funds will be used to satisfy C claims and that \nnothing will remain to revert to Company.  Company further represents that the D \nplaced Company in substantially the same economic position as the party \nmanufacturers of G products agreeing to the A.  That is, Company effectively \ncontributes funds to satisfy its ultimate liability to the Cs for damage caused by its G \nproducts.  Consequently, Company believes that it should receive the same tax \ntreatment under sections 461 and 468B of the Internal Revenue Code as the \nmanufacturers of G products agreeing to the A. \n \n \nREQUESTED RULING 1 \n \n \nEscrow Account Classification \n \n \nSection 468B(g) of the Code provides, in part, that nothing in any provision of law \nshall be construed as providing that an escrow account, settlement fund, or similar fund \nis not subject to current income tax.  Pursuant to the authority of section 468B(g), the \nSecretary has published sections 1.468B-1 through 1.468B-5 of the regulations \nregarding qualified settlement funds. \n \n \nSection 1.468B-1(a) provides that a qualified settlement fund is a fund, account, \nor trust that satisfies all three requirements of section 1.468B-1(c).  First, section \n1.468B-1(c)(1) requires that the fund, account, or trust is established pursuant to an \n \nPLR-124833-02 \n \n \n5 \norder of, or it is approved by, the United States, any state (including the District of \nColumbia), territory, possession, or political subdivision thereof, or any agency or \ninstrumentality (including a court of law) of any of the foregoing and is subject to the \ncontinued jurisdiction of that governmental authority.  Second, section 1.468B-1(c)(2) \nrequires that the fund, account, or trust is established to resolve or satisfy one or more \ncontested or uncontested claims that have resulted or may result from an event (or \nrelated series of events) that has occurred and that has given rise to at least one claim \nasserting liability (i) under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation \nand Liability Act of 1980; (ii) arising out of a tort, breach of contract, or violation of law; \nor (iii) designated by the Commissioner in a revenue ruling or revenue procedure.  \nThird, section 1.468B-1(c)(3) provides that the fund, account, or trust must be a trust \nunder applicable state law, or its assets must be otherwise segregated from other \nassets of the transferor (and related persons). \n \n \nSection 1.468B-1(j)(1) provides that if a fund, account or trust is established to \nresolve or satisfy claims described in section 1.468B-1(c)(2), the assets of the fund, \naccount, or trust are treated as owned by the transferor of those assets until the fund, \naccount, or trust also meets the requirements of sections 1.468B-1(c)(1) and (c)(3).  On \nthe date the fund, account, or trust satisfies all the requirements of section 1.468B-1(c), \nthe transferor is treated as transferring the assets to a qualified settlement fund. \n \n \nSection 1.468B-2(k)(2) provides that a qualified settlement fund is in existence \nfor the period that (i) begins on the first date on which the fund is treated as a qualified \nsettlement fund under section 1.468B-1; and (ii) ends on the earlier of the date the fund \n(A) no longer satisfies the requirements of section 1.468B-1; or (B) no longer has any \nassets and will not receive any more transfers. \n \n \nBased on the facts represented, on Date 2 the escrow accounts established by \nCompany satisfied all three requirements of section 1.468B-1(c), and therefore are \ntreated as qualified settlement funds as of that date.  First, in Year 3 the escrow \naccounts were approved by the Cs and are subject to the continuing jurisdiction of the \nCs.  Each escrow account established by Company must be approved by the C for \nwhich the account is established.  The appropriate official of each C has the authority to \nmonitor and pursue in court charges against Company to enforce annual compliance \nwith the D. \n \n \nSecond, the escrow accounts are established to resolve or satisfy one or more \ncontested or uncontested claims that have resulted or may result from an event (or \nrelated series of events) that has occurred and that has given rise to at least one claim \nasserting liability arising out of a violation of law.  There is no question that Company \nused, sold, distributed, manufactured, developed, advertised, and marketed G products.  \nIn its draft complaint sent to Company on Date 2, L alleges at least one claim against \nCompany asserting liability arising out of a violation of laws resulting from the sale of G \nproducts and related actions.  The escrow accounts, although mandated by D, are \n \nPLR-124833-02 \n \n \n6 \nexpressly and solely established by Company to resolve or satisfy those, and similar, \nclaims. \n \n \nNote that the facts in this case are distinguishable from Example 7 in section \n1.468B-1(k) regarding a landfill operator.  There, a corporation owned and operated a \nlandfill in a state that required the corporation to transfer money to a trust annually \nbased on the total tonnage of material placed in the landfill during the year.  Under the  \nlaw, the corporation is required to perform (either itself or through contractors) specified \nclosure activities when the landfill is full, and the trust assets would be used to \nreimburse the corporation for these closure costs.  The trust in that example is not a \nqualified settlement fund because it is established to secure the liability of the \ncorporation to perform such closure activities.  The instant case does not involve a \nperformance liability.  The funds transferred to the escrow accounts under the D are not \nused to secure the future performance of Company.  To the contrary, the funds will be \nused to satisfy the Cs claims based on the past conduct of Company that has resulted \nin known injuries to the Cs (i.e., increased M and related financial burdens) that have \ngiven rise to known liabilities (i.e., violations of state laws) against Company. \n \n \nThird, the assets in the escrow accounts are segregated from other assets of \nCompany (and related persons).  Beginning in Year 3, Company established separate \nescrow accounts with several leading financial institutions, including accounts at B.  \nUnder the regulations, a separate bank account is sufficient to satisfy this requirement.  \nSee section 1.468B-1(h)(1). \n \n \nThus, since the escrow accounts satisfied all three requirements on Date 2 (in \nYear 4), Company is treated as transferring the assets to qualified settlement funds on \nDate 2, which is the first date on which the escrow accounts are treated as qualified \nsettlement funds under section 1.468B-1. \n \n \nREQUESTED RULINGS 2 and 3 \n \n \nDeduction of Payments  \n \n \nSection 162(a) of the Code provides the general rule that there shall be allowed \nas a deduction all the ordinary and necessary expenses paid or incurred during the \ntaxable year in carrying on any trade or business.  See also section 1.162-1(a).   \n   \n \nSection 461(a) provides, in part, that the amount of any deduction shall be taken \nfor the taxable year that is the proper taxable year under the method of accounting used \nin computing taxable income. \n \n \nPLR-124833-02 \n \n \n7 \nSection 1.461-1(a)(2) provides, in part, that under an accrual method of \naccounting, a liability is incurred, and generally taken into account for federal income tax \npurposes, in the taxable year in which all the events have occurred that establish the \nfact of the liability, the amount of the liability can be determined with reasonable \naccuracy, and economic performance has occurred with respect to the liability. \n \n \nSection 461(f) provides that if (1) the taxpayer contests an asserted liability, (2) \nthe taxpayer transfers money or other property to provide for the satisfaction of the \nasserted liability, (3) the contest with respect to the asserted liability exists after the time \nof the transfer, and (4) but for the fact that the asserted liability is contested, a deduction \nwould be allowed for the taxable year of the transfer (or for an earlier taxable year) \ndetermined after application of section 461(h), then the deduction shall be allowed for \nthe taxable year of the transfer. \n \n \nSection 461(h)(1) provides, in part, that in determining whether an amount has \nbeen incurred with respect to any item during the taxable year, the all events test shall \nnot be treated as met any earlier than when economic performance with respect to such \nitem occurs. \n \n \nSection 461(h)(4) provides that the all events test is met with respect to any item \nif all events have occurred which determine the fact of the liability and the amount of \nsuch liability can be determined with reasonable accuracy.  \n \n \nSection 1.468B-3(c)(1) provides that for purposes of section 461(h), economic \nperformance occurs with respect to a liability described in section 1.468B-1(c)(2) to the \nextent the transferor makes a transfer to a qualified settlement fund to resolve or satisfy \nthe liability. \n \n \nSection 1.468B-3(c)(2) provides that economic performance does not occur to \nthe extent (A) the transferor (or a related person) has a right to a refund or reversion of \na transfer if that right is exercisable currently and without the agreement of an unrelated \nperson that is independent or has an adverse interest (e.g., the court or agency that \napproved the fund, or the fund claimants), or (B) money or property is transferred under \nconditions that allow its refund or reversion by reason of the occurrence of an event that \nis certain to occur, such as the passage of time, or if restrictions on its refund or \nreversion are illusory. \n \n \nSection 1.468B-3(f)(1) provides that a transferor must include in gross income \nany distribution it receives from a qualified settlement fund. \n \n \nSection 1.468B-3(f)(3) provides that a distribution described in section 1.468B-\n3(f)(1) or (f)(2) is excluded from the gross income of a transferor to the extent provided \nby section 111(a) (regarding the recovery of tax benefit items). \n \n \nPLR-124833-02 \n \n \n8 \n \nBased on the above, the amounts transferred into escrow accounts will be used \nto pay money damages to the Cs for liabilities that arose as a result of Company\u2019s \nprincipal business activity, that is, the manufacture and sale of G products and F.  Thus, \nsuch amounts are deductible under section 162(a) as ordinary and necessary business \nexpenses.  To the extent that the all events tests under section 1.461-1(a)(2), including \neconomic performance, are met, the amounts transferred into the escrow accounts \nwould be deductible in the taxable year transferred.  In this case, the first prong of the \nall events test, i.e., all the events have occurred that establish the fact of the liability, is \nmet because this is a contested liability within the meaning of section 461(f).  Likewise,  \nthe second prong, i.e., the amount of the liability can be determined with reasonable \naccuracy, is met because the amount of the liability can be readily ascertained based on \nthe formula prescribed by the D.  Finally, under section 1.468B-3(c), transfers to a \nqualified settlement fund to resolve or satisfy claims for which it is established constitute \neconomic performance.  Therefore, transfers to the escrow accounts are deductible in \nthe taxable year Company makes the transfers to the qualified settlement funds.  In this \ncase, transfers made prior to Date 2 will be treated as made on Date 2, which is the first \ndate on which the escrow accounts are treated as qualified settlement funds.  See \nsupra. \n \nThe fact that the D provides for a reversion of monies if any remain after Number \nfrom the date of the transfers does not prevent economic performance from occurring \nunder the facts represented.  The D provides that the monies transferred into the \nescrow accounts revert to Company after Number from the date of the transfers if the \nCs have not filed and prevailed on claims either by obtaining a judgment against, or a \nsettlement with, Company.  The funds exist to satisfy C claims brought against \nCompany within Number after the date monies are transferred into the funds.  Company \nmay not access the funds for any purpose other than satisfying C claims during the \nNumber period.  Company expects that claims will be made against all the assets of the \nfunds and, if successful, the funds will be used to satisfy C claims and that nothing will \nremain to revert to Company.  There is no guarantee and little likelihood that any \namounts will revert to Company after Number.  The reversion in this case requires not \nonly the passage of time, but also the successful defense against claims brought by the \nCs before anything reverts to Company.  Although the passage of time (i.e., Number) is \ncertain to occur, it is clearly uncertain whether the Cs will neither file nor prevail on \nclaims against Company.  Thus, the payments are not transferred under conditions that \nallow its refund or reversion by reason of the occurrence of an event that is certain to \noccur.  Finally, Company does not have a currently exercisable right to a refund or \nreversion.  However, to the extent Company receives any distributions from the escrow \naccounts, e.g., overpayments, refunds, interest or other appreciation on the funds, \nCompany must include such amounts in its gross income. \n \n \n \n \n \nPLR-124833-02 \n \n \n9 \nREQUESTED RULING 4 \n \n \nTaxation of Escrow Accounts \n \n \nSection 1.468B-2(a) of the regulations provides that a qualified settlement fund is \na United States person and is subject to tax on its modified gross income for any \ntaxable year at a rate equal to the maximum rate in effect for that taxable year under \nsection 1(e) of the Code. \n \n \n \n \n \nSection 1.468B-2(k)(1) provides that a qualified settlement fund must file an \nincome tax return with respect to the tax imposed under section 1.468B-2(a) for each \ntaxable year that the fund is in existence, whether or not the fund has gross income for \nthat taxable year. \n \n \nBecause the escrow accounts in this case are qualified settlement funds \nbeginning in Year 4, they will be subject to tax on their modified gross income for any \ntaxable year that the qualified settlement funds are in existence at a rate equal to the \nmaximum rate in effect for that taxable year under section 1(e). \n \n \nREQUESTED RULING 5 \n \n \nPayments Not Gross Income to Escrow Accounts \n \nSection 1.468B-2(b)(1) of the regulations provides that, in general, amounts \ntransferred to the qualified settlement fund by, or on behalf of, a transferor to resolve or \nsatisfy a liability for which the fund is established are excluded from gross income.  \nHowever, dividends on stock of a transferor (or a related person), interest on debt of a \ntransferor (or a related person), and payments in compensation for late or delayed \ntransfers, are not excluded from gross income. \n \n \nIn this case the escrow accounts are qualified settlement funds that are \nestablished, pursuant to the approval of the Cs, to assume and pay Company\u2019s \nliabilities related to the sale of G products and F.  Accordingly, transfers made by, or on \nbehalf of, Company to resolve or satisfy such liabilities will not constitute gross income \n to the qualified settlement funds. \n \n \n \n \nPLR-124833-02 \n \n \n10 \nCONCLUSIONS \n \n \n \nBased solely on the information provided and the representations made, we \nconclude as follows: \n \n \n(1) The escrow accounts established with B pursuant to the D are treated as \nqualified settlement funds within the meaning of section 1.468B-1 of the regulations, as \nof Date 2, which is the date on which all of the requirements of section 1.468B-1 are \nsatisfied. \n \n \n(2) All transfers to the qualified settlement funds are deductible in the taxable \nyear transferred to qualified settlement funds.  With respect to transfers to escrow \naccounts made prior to Date 2, Company is treated as transferring those assets to \nqualified settlement funds on Date 2, which is the first date the escrow accounts are \ntreated as qualified settlement funds.  Further, to the extent the qualified settlement \nfunds make any distributions to Company for any overpayments or refunds in the event  \nmonies remain after Number from the date of transfer, Company must include such \namounts in its gross income to the extent provided by section 111.  In addition, to the \nextent the qualified settlement fund makes a distribution to Company for interest earned \non the escrow accounts, Company must include such amount in gross income under \nsection 61(a)(4).  See also \u00a7 61(a)(15). \n \n \n(3) Subsequent transfers to the qualified settlement funds, as well as new \nqualified settlement funds established with B or a similar financial institution to resolve \nor satisfy like claims of the Cs, will be deductible in the taxable year transfers are made \ninto the qualified settlement funds. \n \n \n(4) Each qualified settlement fund is subject to tax on its modified gross income \nfor any taxable year at a rate equal to the maximum rate in effect for that taxable year \nunder section 1(e) of the Code. \n \n \n(5) Transfers to the qualified settlement funds by Company will not constitute \ngross income to the qualified settlement funds.  However, the interest earned on the \nassets in the qualified settlement funds will constitute gross income to the qualified \nsettlement funds. \n \n \nExcept as expressly provided herein, no opinion is expressed or implied \nconcerning the tax consequences of any aspect of any transaction or item discussed or \nreferenced in this letter.  This ruling is directed only to Company who requested it.  \nSection 6110(k)(3) of the Code provides that it may not be used or cited as precedent. \n \n \nPLR-124833-02 \n \n \n11 \n \nIn accordance with the Powers of Attorney on file with this office, a copy of this \nletter is being sent to Company\u2019s authorized representatives.

The Trustee represents the\nfollowing facts.\nThe Trust was established by the Tribe under the Indian\nGaming Regulatory Act, 25 U.S.C. 2701 (1988) (the \"Act\"), for\nthe benefit of M, one of its minor members.  The purpose of\nTrust is to receive, hold, and invest payments made for the\nbenefit of M (\"per capita payments\"), under the Act and\npursuant to the Plan.  The Trust conducts no other business\nactivities.\nCongress enacted the Act on October 17, 1988.  Section 3\nof the Act provides that the purpose of the Act is to provide\na statutory basis for the operation of gaming by Indian tribes\nas a means of promoting tribal economic development, self-\nsufficiency, and strong tribal governments, and to declare\nthat the establishment of independent federal regulatory\nauthority for gaming on Indian lands, the establishment of \nfederal standards for gaming on Indian lands, and the\nestablishment of a National Indian Gaming Commission are\nnecessary to meet congressional concerns regarding gaming and\n-3-\nPLR-105061-98\nto protect such gaming as a means of generating tribal\nrevenue.\nSection 11(b)(3) of the Act provides that net revenues\nfrom any class II gaming activities conducted or licensed by\nany Indian tribe may be used to make per capita payments to\nmembers of the tribe only if: (A) the Indian tribe has\nprepared a plan to allocate revenues to uses authorized by \n\u00a7 11(b)(2)(B) of the Act; (B) the plan is approved by the\nSecretary of the Interior as adequate, particularly with\nrespect to the uses described in clause (i) or (iii) of\nparagraph (2)(B); (C) the interests of minors and other\nlegally incompetent persons who are entitled to receive any of\nthe per capita payments are protected and preserved and the\nper capita payments are disbursed to the parents or legal\nguardian of such minors or legal incompetents in such amounts\nas may be necessary for the health, education, or welfare of\nthe minor or other legally incompetent person under a plan\napproved by the Secretary of the Interior and the governing\nbody of the Indian tribe; and (D) the per capita payments are\nsubject to federal taxation and tribes notify members of such\ntax liability when payments are made.  Under \u00a7 11(d) of the\nAct, class III gaming activities are lawful on Indian lands if\nthey meet the requirements of \u00a7 11(b) of the Act.\nOn date a, the Tribe entered into the Compact with the\nState.  Subsequently, the Tribe adopted the Plan, which was\napproved by the Secretary of the Interior.  Pursuant to the\nPlan, g percent of net gaming proceeds are distributed to\ntribal members as per capita payments.  Regarding per capita\npayments, the Plan specifically provides, in part, that--\nPer Capita payments made to minors (under [ b] years\nof age) will be placed in a U.S. Government backed trust\nfund until they reach the age of [b].  At this time the\nmember may begin receiving their Per Capita Payments but\nany funds placed in Trust on their behalf shall remain in\nTrust until the member reaches the age of [ c].  At this\ntime the member may withdraw up to [d percent] of the\nTrust Fund per year but the amount withdrawn shall not\nexceed $e per year.  A member may continue to withdraw\nmoney from this fund at the same yearly rate until the\nmember reaches the age of [f].  Upon reaching the age of\n[f] the member may withdraw the remaining balance of\ntheir Trust Fund.\nOn date h, the Tribe adopted the Document.  The Tribe is\nthe settlor and the sole trustee of each trust created under\n-4-\nPLR-105061-98\nthe Document.  On date i, N, the mother of M, executed the\nAgreement ratifying the Document.\nThe Document and the Agreement create the Trust, which\nhas all the terms and provisions of the Document.  The\nDocument provides that \"all provisions of this Trust\ninstrument shall be construed, limited, and applied so as to\nresult in compliance with, and shall be subject to the\nprovisions of, the ... Act and/or Plan, including any changes\nor amendments thereto.\"  The Trust is irrevocable.  The Tribe\nretained the right to modify, alter, or amend the terms and\nprovisions of the Trust, \"provided such modification,\nalteration, or amendment is required under the [Act].\"\nThe sole principal and income beneficiary of each trust\ncreated under the Document is the beneficiary named in each\ntrust adoption agreement, which is similar to the Agreement. \nThe sole beneficiary of the Trust is M.  If M or any successor\nbeneficiary should die during the term of the Trust, the\ndescendants of the beneficiary, if any, shall receive that\nbeneficiary\u2019s share, in trust, for the remaining trust term,\nas if that descendant were the original beneficiary of the\nTrust.  If any beneficiary shall die without descendants\nduring the term of the Trust, that beneficiary\u2019s interest in\nthe Trust shall vest in equal proportion in the other\nsurviving siblings of the beneficiary.  If any beneficiary\nshall die without descendants and without siblings (or\ndescendants of siblings) during the term of the Trust, that\nbeneficiary\u2019s interest will revest in the Tribe to be\ndistributed as additional per capita payments under the Act\nand the Plan.\nThe term of the Trust will last until the beneficiary\nattains the age of f, whereupon all the beneficiary\u2019s share of\ncorpus and accumulated income, if any, shall be distributed to\nthat beneficiary free of trust.  The Tribe has the discretion\nto terminate the trust prior to the beneficiary attaining the\nage of f, in whole or in part, if the value of the trust\nproperty no longer justifies the expenses of trust management,\nor the Tribe considers such distribution to be in the best\ninterest of the beneficiary, considering the demonstrated\nability of the beneficiary to handle money properly and\nwisely, to use judgment, prudence, and discretion, and\nconsidering any other factors the Tribe may consider relevant.\nThe income of the beneficiary is accumulated in trust and\nadded to the principal of the trust unless a distribution is\nmade to the beneficiary under other provisions of the trust. \n-5-\nPLR-105061-98\nAccumulated income or principal may be distributed to a\nbeneficiary from that beneficiary\u2019s share of income or\nprincipal if the Tribe determines that the beneficiary needs\nresources for her health, education, or welfare, after taking\ninto consideration funds available from other sources known to\nthe Tribe, including financial sources of the beneficiary\u2019s\nparents or legal guardians.  For determining what constitutes\nthe health, education, or welfare of a beneficiary, the\nDocument provides detailed standards.\nThe Document provides that the law of the U.S. and of the\nTribe shall govern, control, and apply to the rights,\nobligations, terms, provisions, and discretions of the\nsettlor, trustee, beneficiaries, and property of the Trust. \nTo the extent not provided for under the laws of the U.S. and\nof the Tribe, the provisions of State trust law shall\notherwise apply to the Trust, except to the extent any\nprovision thereof has been specifically excluded by federal or\ntribal law.  The situs of the Trust is the tribal reservation\nof the Tribe.\nA full per capita share of the net gaming proceeds has\nbeen paid into the Trust since its creation.  For the Trust\u2019s\nfirst tax year (j), per capita payments totaling $k were paid\ninto the Trust.  No money was distributed from the Trust in j\nor m.  The Trust filed a j income tax return reflecting all\nper capita payments, and the $n of interest income earned\nthereon, as items of income reported by, and taxable to, the\nTrust at the Trust\u2019s income tax rate.  None of the per capita\npayments or the interest income earned thereon were reported\nas income by the Trust beneficiary.  For year m, the per\ncapita payments made to the Trust totaled $ p, and the Trust\u2019s\ninterest and dividend income was $q.\nSection 61 defines gross income as income from whatever\nsource derived.\nIn general, a cash basis taxpayer does not recognize\nincome upon the receipt of property in the form of a promise\nto pay in the future.  However, a cash basis taxpayer is taxed\nwhen the taxpayer receives an \"economic benefit\" from a right\nto receive property in the future.\nIn Sproull v. Commissioner, 16 T.C. 244 (1951), aff\u2019d per\ncuriam, 194 F.2d 541 (6th Cir. 1952), the court held that the\namount placed in trust to be paid out to the taxpayer in later\nyears conferred an economic benefit on the taxpayer in the\nyear the trust was funded.  In that case, the taxpayer, a\n-6-\nPLR-105061-98\ncorporation president, voluntarily decreased his compensation. \nIn a later year, when the corporation was sound financially, a\ntrust was set up by the board of directors for the benefit of\nthe taxpayer.  In determining that funding the trust conferred\nan economic benefit on the taxpayer in the year the trust was\nestablished, the court noted that the funds were placed in\ntrust irrevocably for the taxpayer\u2019s sole benefit and that the\ntaxpayer had to do nothing further to establish his right to\nit.\nThe economic benefit doctrine also has been applied to\nrequire inclusion in income of prize winnings when they are\nirrevocably placed in a fund to be paid to the winner at a\nlater date.  See Pulsifer v. Commissioner, 64 T.C. 245 (1975);\nAnastasio v. Commissioner, 67 T.C. 814 (1977); Rev. Rul. 62-\n74, 1962-1 C.B. 68; and Rev. Rul 67-203, 1967-1 C.B. 105.\nRev. Rul. 83-25, 1983-1 C.B. 116, holds that a minor\nreceived the economic benefit of a trust when it was\nestablished by court order to receive damages awarded to the\nminor as a result of a personal injury suit.  Under the terms\nof the trust, the trustee was authorized to distribute funds\nnecessary for the health, education, support, or maintenance\nof the minor.  The trust was not subject to revocation by the\nminor, but was subject to amendment, modification, or\nrevocation by the court.  The trust was to terminate upon the\nminor reaching the age of 21, at which time the trust would\ndistribute all of its property to him.  Rev. Rul. 83-25\nfurther holds that the minor is the owner of the damages; the\nminor is treated as the grantor of the trust, and under \n\u00a7 677(a), as the owner of the trust because the trust income\nand corpus is to be distributed to the minor at the discretion\nof the court, a nonadverse party, or eventually distributed to\nthe minor when the minor turns 21 years old.\nSection 671 provides that, where it is specified under\nsubpart E that the grantor or another person shall be treated\nas the owner of any portion of a trust, there shall then be\nincluded in computing the taxable income and credits of the\ngrantor or the other person those items of income, deductions,\nand credits against tax of the trust that are attributable to\nthat portion of the trust to the extent that such items would\nbe taken into account under chapter 1 in computing taxable\nincome or credits against the tax of an individual.\nSection 673 provides that the grantor shall be treated as\nthe owner of any portion of a trust in which he has a\nreversionary interest in either the corpus or the income\n-7-\nPLR-105061-98\ntherefrom if, as of the inception of that portion of the\ntrust, the value of that interest exceeds 5 percent of the\nvalue of that portion.\nIn Estate of Cardeza v. U.S., 261 F2d. 423 (3d Cir.\n1958), the court held that a reversionary interest in a trust\nthat would have become effective only if the decedent-grantor\nhad survived the current beneficiaries and their issue did not\nmake the grantor\u2019s contributions to the trust includable in\nher gross estate.  This holding was reached under a statute\nproviding that property, the transfer of which was intended to\ntake effect at or after the transferor\u2019s death, would not be\nincludable in gross estate unless the transferor retained a\nreversionary interest worth more than 5 percent of the value\nof the property transferred.  The court concluded that a\nreversion dependent upon the failure of issue is not\nsusceptible to valuation using actuarial principles, and thus,\nunder the rule established in Robinette v. Helvering, 318 U.S.\n184 (1943), is considered to have no value.\nSection 677 provides that the grantor shall be treated as\nthe owner of any portion of a trust, whether or not he is\ntreated as such owner under \u00a7 674, whose income without the\napproval or consent of any adverse party is, or, in the\ndiscretion of the grantor or a nonadverse party, or both, may\nbe distributed to the grantor or the grantor's spouse; or held\nor accumulated for future distribution to the grantor or the\ngrantor's spouse.\nIf M dies before age f, her interest in the Trust vests\nfirst in her descendants, and if none is living, then in her\nsiblings.  If M has no living descendants or siblings, then\nher interest vests in the descendants of her siblings.  If,\nupon M's death before age f, no one exists in any of these\nclasses of successor beneficiaries, then the property held in\nthe Trust reverts to the Tribe to be distributed as additional\nper capita payments to other tribal members.  The Tribe has a\nreversionary interest in the Trust.  We have determined,\nhowever, that no reasonable assumption exists that would\npermit the possibility of issue to be ignored or discounted. \nThus, because the Tribe's reversionary interest cannot be\nvalued using actuarial principles, we conclude that the value\nof the Tribe's reversionary interest is zero and that the\nTribe should not be considered the owner of the Trust under \n\u00a7 673.\nUnder \u00a7 11(b)(3)(C) of the Act, the Tribe may not provide\nfor per capita payments unless \"the interests of minors and\n-8-\nPLR-105061-98\nother legally incompetent persons who are entitled to receive\nany of the per capita payments are protected and preserved.\" \nThe Tribe made the per capita payments to the Trust for M\u2019s \n-9-\nPLR-105061-98\nbenefit.  The Agreement contains numerous provisions\nprotecting the trust beneficiary\u2019s interest in the per capita\npayments.\nThe Trust is irrevocable and was established for the sole\nbenefit of M.  Considering the provisions of the Act, the\nPlan, and the Document, we conclude that M receives the\neconomic benefit of the per capita payments when they are\ndeposited into the Trust.  When the per capita payments are\nmade, M must treat these payments to the Trust, as well as all\nincome earned therefrom, as items of gross income reportable\non her individual federal income tax return.\nAs the owner of the per capita payments deposited in the\nTrust, M is considered the grantor of the Trust.  Under the\nprovisions of the Trust, trust income and corpus are to be\ndistributed to the trust beneficiary at the discretion of a\nnon-adverse party, or held or accumulated for future\ndistribution.  We conclude, therefore, that M is the owner of\nthe Trust under \u00a7 677(a). \nAfter applying the applicable law to the facts\nrepresented, we rule that:\n1.  M is in receipt of an economic benefit upon the\nfunding of the Trust with the per capita payments, and\ntherefore, under \u00a7 61, must include the deposits of the\nper capita payments in her gross income for the year in\nwhich they are made to the trust.\n2.  For federal income tax purposes, M is treated as the\ngrantor of the Trust.\n3.  Under \u00a7 677, M is the owner of the Trust, and\ntherefore, must include all items of income, deductions,\nand credits of the Trust in determining her taxable\nincome.\nThese rulings are conditioned on M and the Trust filing\namended returns for year j, properly reflecting M's ownership\nof the Trust.  Except for the specific rulings above, no\nopinion is expressed or implied concerning the federal tax\nconsequences of the facts of this case under any other\nprovision of the Code.\nUnder the power of attorney on file with this office, we\nare sending a copy of this letter to your authorized\nrepresentative.\n-10-\nPLR-105061-98\nThis ruling is directed only to the taxpayer who\nrequested it.

The information submitted in that request and \nin later correspondence is summarized below.\nThe rulings contained in this letter are based upon information and representations \nsubmitted by the taxpayer and accompanied by a penalty of perjury statement executed \nby an appropriate party.   \nPLR-117996-12\n3\nThis office has not verified any of the materials submitted in support of the request for \nrulings.  Verification of the information, representations, and other data may be required \nas part of the audit process.  In particular, no determination has been made regarding \nwhether the Internal or External Distribution (defined below):  (i) satisfies the business \npurpose requirement of section 1.355-2(b) of the Income Tax Regulations, (ii) is used \nprincipally as a device for the distribution of the earnings and profits of Parent, \nDistributing or Controlled (see section 355(a)(1)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code and \nTreas. Reg. section 1.355-2(d)), or (iii) is part of a plan (or series of related transactions) \npursuant to which one or more persons will acquire directly or indirectly stock \nrepresenting a 50 percent or greater interest in Parent, Distributing or Controlled (see \nsection 355(e) and Treas. Reg. section 1.355-7).  \nSummary of Facts\nParent is a State A corporation that is a holding company that uses the accrual method \nof accounting.  Parent is the common parent of an affiliated group of corporations that \nfiles a consolidated federal income tax return.  Distributing is a State A corporation and \nis an accrual method taxpayer that, at all times relevant to this request, has joined with \nParent in filing a consolidated federal income tax return with a calendar year end.  \nDistributing is directly engaged in Business A and Business B.  Approximately a percent \nof Parent\u2019s outstanding common stock is held by Individual 1, approximately b percent \nis held by Individual 2 and approximately c percent is held by Individual 3 (Individual 1, \nIndividual 2 and Individual 3 are the \u201cShareholders\u201d).  Approximately d percent of \nParent\u2019s outstanding convertible preferred stock (\u201cPreferred Stock\u201d) is held by Equity \nFund 1 and approximately e percent is held by Equity Fund 2.  There are f warrants \nissued to the holders of Preferred Stock (Equity Fund 1 and 2 are the \u201cPreferred Stock \nand Warrant Holders\u201d).  \nParent currently has outstanding stock options issued under its stock option plan. The \noutstanding options consist of incentive stock options granted to Individual 2 to \npurchase g shares of Parent common stock (the \u201cOutstanding Options\u201d).  \nBusiness A has had gross receipts and operating expenses representative of the active \nconduct of a trade or business for each of the past five years.  Business B constitutes \nan expansion of Business A and does not constitute a new or different business.\nProposed Transaction\nFor what are represented to be valid business purposes, Parent and Distributing \npropose to undertake the following steps (the \u201cProposed Transaction\u201d):\n(i)\nDistributing will form Controlled, a State A corporation. \nPLR-117996-12\n4\n(ii)\nDistributing will contribute the assets and liabilities constituting Business B as \ncurrently conducted by Distributing to Controlled in exchange for shares of \nControlled common stock, shares of convertible preferred stock and warrants, \nwhich will represent 100 percent of the Controlled common and convertible \npreferred stock and warrants outstanding (the \u201cContribution\u201d).\n(iii)\nDistributing and Controlled will execute a debt facility agreement creating the \nControlled Debt.\n(iv)\nDistributing will distribute all its shares of Controlled common and convertible \npreferred stock and warrants (representing 100 percent of the Controlled \ncommon and convertible preferred stock and warrants outstanding) to Parent \n(the \u201cInternal Distribution\u201d).\n(v)\nParent will distribute all of its shares of Controlled common and convertible \npreferred stock and warrants (representing 100 percent of the Controlled \ncommon, convertible preferred stock and warrants outstanding) to the \nShareholders and the Preferred Stock and Warrant Holders in identical \nproportion to their ownership of Parent (the \u201cExternal Distribution\u201d).  \n(vi)\nThe Outstanding Options will be exchanged for new incentive stock options \nsubject to the same terms and vesting schedule as the related Outstanding \nOptions.  Individual 2 will surrender his Outstanding Options and receive, in \nexchange, adjusted stock options in Parent (\u201cNew Parent Options\u201d) and \nControlled (\u201cNew Controlled Options\u201d).  The New Parent and New Controlled \nOptions will preserve the economic value of the Outstanding Options. The \nexercise price of the New Parent Options and the New Controlled Options will \nbear the same percentage relationship to the market price of Parent and \nControlled common stock after the External Distribution as the exercise price \nof the Outstanding Options bore to the market price of Parent stock before the \nProposed Transaction.\n(vii)\nTo accommodate Controlled\u2019s business needs, Individual 1 and Individual 2, \nboth employees of Distributing, will serve as employees for Distributing and \nControlled after the External Distribution.\n(viii)\nTo accommodate Controlled\u2019s business needs, three of the five directors for \nDistributing will also serve as three of the five directors for Controlled (the \n\u201cOverlapping Directors\u201d).  Controlled intends that within h years of the \nExternal Distribution, as a result of the addition of new directors, the \nresignation by Overlapping Directors, the removal of Overlapping Directors \nfrom the Controlled board, or other means, the Overlapping Directors will \nconstitute a minority of Controlled\u2019s board of directors.\nPLR-117996-12\n5\n(ix)\nIn connection with the Proposed Transaction, Distributing and Controlled will \nenter into certain agreements concerning continuing business arrangements \nrelating to Business A and Business B (the \u201cContinuing Arrangements\u201d).  The \nContinuing Arrangements are expected to exist for less than i years.\nRepresentations\n(a)\nBusiness B is an expansion of Business A, an existing business, as \ncontemplated by Treas. Reg. section 1.355-3(b)(3)(ii).\n(b)\nNone of the Controlled convertible preferred stock will be nonqualified \npreferred stock within the meaning of section 351(g)(2).\n(c)\nThere are no accumulated but unpaid dividends to the Preferred Stock.\n(d)\nThere is no regulatory, legal, contractual, or economic compulsion or \nrequirement that Distributing fund part or all of the Controlled Debt as a \ncondition of the distribution of Controlled.\n(e)\nThe exercise price of, and the number of Parent shares subject to, the \nOutstanding Options will be adjusted to reflect the change in value of Parent \nshares as a result of the Proposed Transaction in a manner that, on a share-\nby-share basis, (a) preserves the aggregate spread between the exercise \nprice of the Outstanding Options and the fair market value of the underlying \nParent stock immediately before the adjustment, and (b) produces a ratio of \nthe exercise price of the New Parent Options and New Controlled Options to \nthe fair market value of the underlying Parent or Controlled stock immediately \nafter the External Distribution that is equal to the ratio of the exercise price of \nthe Outstanding Options to the fair market value of the underlying Parent \ncommon stock immediately before the Proposed Transaction.\nContribution and Internal Distribution\n(f)\nThe indebtedness, if any, owed by Controlled to Distributing after the Internal \nDistribution will not constitute stock or securities.\n(g)\nNo part of the consideration to be distributed by Distributing will be received \nby Parent as a creditor or in any capacity other than that of a shareholder of \nDistributing.\n(h)\nThe five years of financial information with regard to Business A and less than \nfive years of financial information with regard to Business B has been \nsubmitted on behalf of Distributing and is representative of Distributing's \npresent operations, and with regard to such operations, there have been no \nPLR-117996-12\n6\nsubstantial operational changes since the date of the last financial statements \nsubmitted.\n(i)\nNeither Business A nor control of an entity conducting this business will have \nbeen acquired during the five-year period ending on the date of the Internal \nDistribution in a transaction in which gain or loss was recognized (or treated \nas recognized under proposed Treas. Reg. section 1.355-3) in whole or in \npart.  Throughout the five-year period ending on the date of the Internal \nDistribution, Distributing has been the principal owner of the goodwill and \nsignificant assets of Business A and will continue to be the principal owner \nfollowing the Internal Distribution.\n(j)\nFollowing the Internal Distribution, Distributing will continue the active conduct \nof Business A, and Controlled will continue the active conduct of Business B, \nboth of which were conducted by Distributing prior to consummation of the\nProposed Transaction and independently and with their separate employees \n(except as provided by the Continuing Arrangements).\n(k)\nThe Internal Distribution will be carried out for the following corporate \nbusiness purposes: (i) simplifying and clarifying the operational structure of \nBusiness A and Business B, streamlining management, reporting and \nadministration, and achieving strategic coherence; and (ii) using equity \nincentives to enable Business A and Business B to attract, retain and properly \nprovide incentives to management (the \u201cCorporate Business Purposes\u201d). The \ndistribution of the common stock, convertible preferred stock and warrants of \nControlled is motivated, in whole or substantial part, by one or more of these \nCorporate Business Purposes.  \n(l)\nThe Internal Distribution is not used principally as a device for the distribution \nof the earnings and profits of Distributing.  See section 355(a)(1)(B).\n(m)\nFor purposes of section 355(d), immediately after the Internal Distribution, no \nperson (determined after applying section 355(d)(7)) will hold stock \npossessing 50 percent or more of the total combined voting power of all \nclasses of Distributing stock entitled to vote or 50 percent or more of the total \nvalue of shares of all classes of Distributing stock that was acquired by \npurchase (as defined in section 355(d)(5) and (8)) during the five-year period \n(determined after applying section 355(d)(6)) ending on the date of the \nInternal Distribution.\n(n)\nFor purposes of section 355(d), immediately after the Internal Distribution, no \nperson (determined after applying section 355(d)(7)) will hold stock \npossessing 50 percent or more of the total combined voting power of all \nclasses of Controlled stock entitled to vote, or 50 percent or more of the total \nPLR-117996-12\n7\nvalue of shares of all classes of Controlled stock that was either (i) acquired \nby purchase (as defined in section 355(d)(5) and (8)) during the five-year \nperiod (determined after applying section 355(d)(6)) ending on the date of \nInternal Distribution or (ii) attributable to distributions on Distributing stock or \nsecurities that were acquired by purchase (as defined in section 355(d)(5) \nand (8)) during the five-year period (determined after applying section \n355(d)(6)) ending on the date of the Internal Distribution.\n(o)\nThe Internal Distribution is not part of a plan or series of related transactions \n(within the meaning of Treas. Reg. section 1.355-7) pursuant to which one or \nmore persons will acquire directly or indirectly stock representing a 50 percent \nor greater interest (within the meaning of section 355(d)(4)) in Distributing or \nControlled (including any predecessor or successor of any such corporation).\n(p)\nNo person will hold, immediately after the Internal Distribution, a 50 percent or \ngreater interest in any disqualified investment corporation (as defined in \nsection 355(g)(2)), that such person did not hold before the Internal \nDistribution (taking into account section 355(g)(3) and (g)(4)).\n(q)\nThe total adjusted basis and the fair market value of the assets transferred to \nControlled in the Contribution will equal or exceed the sum of (i) the total \nliabilities assumed (within the meaning of section 357(d)) by Controlled, and \n(ii) the total amount of any money and the fair market value of any other \nproperty (within the meaning of section 361(b)) received by Distributing and \ntransferred to its creditors in connection with the reorganization.\n(r)\nThe liabilities assumed (within the meaning of section 357(d)) by Controlled in \nthe Contribution, if any, and the liabilities to which the transferred assets are \nsubject, if any, were incurred in the ordinary course of business and are \nassociated with the assets being transferred.\n(s)\nThe total fair market value of the assets transferred by Distributing to \nControlled in the Contribution will exceed the sum of: (i) the amount of any \nliabilities assumed (within the meaning of section 357(d)) by Controlled in \nconnection with the exchange, (ii) the amount of any liabilities owed to \nControlled by Distributing that are discharged or extinguished in connection \nwith the exchange, and (iii) the amount of cash and the fair market value of \nany other property (other than stock and securities permitted to be received \nunder section 361(a) without the recognition of gain) received by Distributing \nin connection with the exchange. The fair market value of the assets of \nControlled will exceed the amount of its liabilities immediately after the \nexchange.\n(t)\nThe aggregate fair market value of the assets transferred to Controlled in the \nPLR-117996-12\n8\nContribution will equal or exceed the aggregate adjusted basis of these \nassets.\n(u)\nExcept for indebtedness that may be created in the ordinary course of \nbusiness or in connection with the Continuing Arrangements or the Controlled \nDebt, no intercorporate debt will exist between Distributing and Controlled at \nthe time of, or subsequent to, the Internal Distribution.\n(v)\nAt the time of the Internal Distribution, Distributing will not have an excess \nloss account in the Controlled stock.\n(w)\nImmediately before the Internal Distribution, items of income, gain, loss, \ndeduction, and credit will be taken into account as required by the applicable \nintercompany transaction regulations (see Treas. Reg. sections 1.1502-13 \nand 1.1502-14 as in effect before publication of T.D. 8597, 1995-2 C.B. 147, \nand as currently in effect; Treas.

The information submitted in that\nletter and later correspondence is summarized below.\nDistributing, a State A corporation, is the parent of a consolidated group of\ncorporations and uses the accrual method of accounting.  Distributing has two classes\nof stock,               stock of which approximately A shares are outstanding and                  \n              stock of which approximately B shares are outstanding.  The               stock is\nwidely held and publicly traded.  The                            stock controls approximately X\npercent of the total voting power of Distributing and is almost exclusively owned by\nFamily.  Distributing and its subsidiaries are engaged in two businesses, Business C\nand Business D, both in the United States and in other countries including Country B.  \nAmong Distributing\u2019s subsidiaries are Subsidiaries 1-10 and Controlled. \nSubsidiary 1, a State B corporation, is a wholly-owned, first-tier subsidiary of\nDistributing and is engaged in both Business C and Business D.  Subsidiaries 2, 4, and\n5, State C corporations, are wholly-owned first-tier subsidiaries of Distributing and are\nengaged in Business D only.  Subsidiaries 3, 7, 8, and 9, State A subsidiaries, are also\nwholly-owned, first-tier subsidiaries of Distributing and are engaged in Business D only. \nSubsidiary 6, a State D corporation, is also a wholly-owned, first-tier subsidiary of\nDistributing and is engaged in Business D only.  Subsidiary 10, a Country B corporation, \nis currently owned Y percent by Subsidiary 6 and Z percent by Subsidiary 8 and is\nengaged in both Business C and Business D.  Controlled,  a State A corporation, was\nformed on Date 1 for purposes of the proposed transaction.  Controlled has two classes \nof stock,               stock and                            stock.\nDistributing has determined that it needs to borrow $E to meet the scheduled\nand anticipated obligations of Business C.  Distributing has been experiencing problems\nborrowing such funds.  Several rating agencies have downgraded Distributing\u2019s credit\nrating due to its ownership of Business D significantly increasing Distributing\u2019s cost of\nborrowing.  Accordingly, Distributing intends to separate its two businesses by\ntransferring Business D to Controlled and then distributing Controlled to its\nshareholders in a proposed transaction with the following steps:\n4\nPLR-120160-98\n(1)\nSubsidiary 10 will form Subsidiary 11, a Country B corporation, and will transfer\nall of its assets associated with Business D to Subsidiary 11 in exchange for all\nof the Subsidiary 11 stock.\n(2)\nSubsidiary 10 will then undergo a recapitalization issuing pro rata to its\nshareholders, in exchange for the currently outstanding Subsidiary 10 stock, new\n              and                                  stock (reorganization shares) redeemable for\nan amount equal to the fair market value of the Business D assets transferred to\nSubsidiary 11.\n(3)\nSubsidiary 6 and Subsidiary 8 will form Subsidiary 12, a Country B corporation,\nand will transfer to Subsidiary 12 the reorganization shares of Subsidiary 10 in\nexchange for the Y percent and Z percent of the Subsidiary 12 stock,\nrespectively.\n(4)\nSubsidiary 10 will then transfer to Subsidiary 12, all of the stock of Subsidiary 11\nin exchange for                                  stock in Subsidiary 12 (the \u201cspecial shares\u201d)\nhaving a fair market value equal to the Subsidiary 11 stock.\n(5)\nSubsidiary 10 will redeem its reorganization shares by issuing to Subsidiary 12 a\nnon-interest bearing note in the amount of the redemption value of the\nreorganization shares.\n(6)\nSubsidiary 12 will redeem its special shares by assigning back to Subsidiary 10\nthe note issued by Subsidiary 10 in redemption of the reorganization shares.\n(7)\nImmediately thereafter, Subsidiary 11 will be liquidated into Subsidiary 10 and\ndissolved.\n(8)\nSubsidiary 6 and Subsidiary 8 will then distribute the stock of Subsidiary 10 to\nDistributing.\n(9)\nSubsidiary 1 which holds certain intangibles associated with both Business C\nand Business D will liquidate into Distributing.  Subsequently, the intangibles\nassociated with Business D will be transferred to Controlled.\n(10)\nDistributing then will transfer the stock of Subsidiaries 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 to\nControlled in exchange for Controlled                        and Controlled                       \n             stock (the contributions).  The stock of Controlled will then be distributed\npro rata to the shareholders of Distributing.\nThe taxpayer has supplied financial information which indicates that Distributing\nand Controlled will each be conducting a business that has had gross receipts and\noperating expenses representative of the active conduct of the business for each of the\n5\nPLR-120160-98\npast five years.\nThe following representations have been made in connection with the proposed\ntransaction:\n(a)\nDistributing will pay the expenses incurred in the proposed transaction.\n(b)\nNo part of the consideration distributed by Distributing will be received by a\nshareholder of Distributing as a creditor, employee, or in any capacity other than\nthat of a shareholder of Distributing.\n(c)\nFollowing the distribution, Distributing and Controlled will each continue the\nactive conduct of its respective business, independently and with separate\nemployees.\n(d)\nThe total adjusted basis and the fair market value of the assets to be transferred\nto Controlled in the contributions will, in each instance, equal or exceed the sum\nof the liabilities assumed by Controlled plus any liabilities to which the transferred\nassets are subject.\n(e)\nThe liabilities assumed by Controlled in the contributions and the liabilities to\nwhich the transferred assets are subject will have been incurred in the ordinary\ncourse of business and will be associated with the transferred assets.\n(f)\nThe distribution of the stock of Controlled is carried out for the corporate\nbusiness purpose of facilitating Distributing to borrow funds necessary to meet\nscheduled and anticipated obligations of Business C. \n(g)\nThe management of Distributing, to its best knowledge, is not aware of any plan\nor intention on the part of any particular shareholder of Distributing to sell,\nexchange, transfer by gift, or otherwise dispose of any stock in either Distributing\nor Controlled after the distribution.\n(h)\nThe five years of financial information submitted for Business C and Business D\nrepresent the present operations of each respective business, and regarding\neach business, there has been no substantial operational change since the date\nof the last financial statement submitted.\n(i)\nThere is no plan or intention to liquidate either Distributing or Controlled, to\nmerge either corporation with any other corporation, or to sell or otherwise\ndispose of any of the assets of either corporation after the proposed\ntransactions, except in the ordinary course of business.\n(j)\nNone of the transferred assets will be subject to investment tax credit recapture.\n6\nPLR-120160-98\n(k)\nAny indebtedness owed by Controlled to Distributing after the distribution of\nControlled stock will not be stock or securities under \u00a7 355.\n(l)\nPayments made in all continuing transactions between Distributing and\nControlled will be for fair market value based on terms and conditions arrived at\nby the parties bargaining at arm\u2019s length.\n(m)\nNo two parties to the transactions are investment companies as defined in         \n\u00a7 368(a)(2)(F)(iii) and (iv).\n(n)\nExcept in connection with a stock repurchase program, there is no plan or\nintention by either Distributing or Controlled, directly or through any subsidiary\ncorporation, to purchase any of its outstanding stock after the distribution other\nthan through stock purchases meeting the requirements of \u00a7 4.05(1)(b) of Rev.\nProc. 96-30, 1996-1 C.B. 696, 705.\n(o)\nImmediately before the distribution, items of income, gain, loss, deduction and\ncredit, if any, will be taken into account as required by the applicable\nintercompany regulations. (See \u00a7 1.1502-13 and \u00a7 1.1502-14 in effect before the\npublication of T.D. 8597, 1995-2 C.B. 147, and as currently in effect; \u00a7 1.1502-13\nas published by T.D. 8597).  Distributing will not have an excess loss account in\nthe stock of any corporation that will leave the Distributing consolidated group in\nthe distribution.\n(p)\nThe distribution is not part of a plan or series of related transactions (within the\nmeaning of section 355(e)) pursuant to which one or more persons will acquire\ndirectly or indirectly stock possessing 50 percent or more of the total combined\nvoting power of all classes of stock of either Distributing or Controlled or stock\npossessing 50 percent or more of the total value of all classes of stock of either\nDistributing or Controlled.\n(q)\nThe gross assets of the trades or businesses relied on to satisfy the active trade\nor business requirement of \u00a7 355(b) for both the distribution of Controlled and\nthe distribution of Subsidiary 12 will have a fair market value that is at least 5\npercent of the total fair market value of the gross assets of the corporation\ndirectly conducting the trade or businesses.\n(r)\nMore than 80% of the value of the outstanding stock of Controlled will be\ndistributed with respect to the outstanding               stock of Distributing that is\nregularly traded on an established securities market.\n(s)\nDistributing does not know, or have reason to know, of any foreign person that\nowns a 5% or greater interest in either class of Distributing               stock.\n7\nPLR-120160-98\n(t)\nDistributing will comply with the notice requirements of \u00a7 1.367(e)-1T(c)(2)(iii).\nBased solely on the information submitted and the representations made, we\nrule as follows:\n(1)\nSteps 1-8 of the proposed transaction will be treated as the transfer by\nSubsidiary 10 of its Business C assets to Subsidiary 12 followed by the\ndistribution of Subsidiary 12 stock to Subsidiary 6 and Subsidiary 8. (Rev. Rul.\n83-142, 1983-2 C.B. 68; Rev. Rul. 77-191, 1977-1 C.B. 94; Rev. Rul. 67-448,\n1967-2 C.B. 144).\n(2)\nThe transfer by Distributing of the assets and liabilities of Business C to\nControlled in exchange for all the stock of Controlled followed by the distribution\nof all of the Controlled stock to the shareholders of Controlled constitutes a\nreorganization within the meaning of \u00a7 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code.  Distributing\nand Controlled will each be a \u201cparty to a reorganization\u201d within the meaning of   \n\u00a7 368(b). \n(3)\nNo gain or loss will be recognized by Distributing as a result of the transfer of the\nassets of Business C to Controlled for the Controlled stock and the assumption \nby Controlled of the Business C liabilities. (\u00a7\u00a7 361(a) and 357(a))\n(4)\nNo gain or loss will be recognized by Controlled on the receipt of the assets of\nBusiness C in exchange for the stock of Controlled.  (\u00a7 1032(a))\n(5)\nThe basis of each asset received by Controlled will be, in each instance, the\nsame as the basis of such asset in the hands of Distributing immediately prior to\nthe distribution. (\u00a7 362(b))\n(6)\nThe holding period of the Business D assets received by Controlled will include\nthe period during which such assets were held by Distributing.  (\u00a7 1223(2))\n(7)\nNo gain or loss will be recognized by, and no amount will be included in the\nincome of, Distributing, on the distribution of shares of Controlled to the\nDistributing shareholders.  (\u00a7\u00a7 361(c))\n(8)\nNo gain or loss will be recognized by, and no amount will otherwise be included\nin the income of, the Distributing shareholders on their receipt of Controlled stock\nin the distribution.  (\u00a7 355(a)(1))\n(9)\nThe aggregate basis of the Controlled stock and the Distributing stock in the\nhands of the shareholders of Distributing, immediately following the distribution,\nwill be the same as the basis of the Distributing stock held immediately before\n8\nPLR-120160-98\nthe distribution, allocated in proportion to the fair market value of each in\naccordance with \u00a7 1.358-2(a)(2).  (\u00a7 358(b)(2))\n(10)\nThe holding period of the Controlled stock received by each Distributing\nshareholder will be the holding period of the Distributing               stock or\nDistributing                            stock as to which the distribution is made, provided\nthat the Distributing               stock or the Distributing                            stock is\nheld as a capital asset on the date of the distribution.  (\u00a7 1223(1))\n(11)\nAs provided in \u00a7 312(h), proper allocation of earnings and profits between\nDistributing and Controlled will be made under \u00a7 1.312-10(a) and 1.1502-33.\n(12)\nNo gain or loss will be recognized by, and no amount will be included in the\nincome of Subsidiary 10, on the deemed distribution of shares of Subsidiary 12\nto its shareholders.

Reg. \u00a71.901-2A(c)(3) in determining the amount of foreign income tax paid or \naccrued to Country L.  The information submitted for consideration is substantially as \nset forth below. \n \nThe ruling contained in this letter is based upon information and representations \nsubmitted by the taxpayer and accompanied by a penalty of perjury statement executed \nby an appropriate party.  While this office has not verified any of the material submitted \nin support of the request for rulings, it is subject to verification on examination. \n \nCorp A is a domestic corporation that is the common parent of an affiliated group of \ncorporations (\u201cthe Corp A Group\u201d) that filed a U.S. consolidated federal income tax \nreturn for Tax Year X and for all subsequent tax years.  The due date (including \n \nPLR-138976-06 \n \n \n2 \nextensions) for Corp A\u2019s U.S. consolidated federal income tax return for Tax Year Y is \nDate N, which is more than 30 days after August 7, 2006.    \n \n \nThe Corp A Group\u2019s Country L operations are conducted by several domestic and \nforeign subsidiaries.  Several of these subsidiaries are, and have been, dual capacity \ntaxpayers, as defined in Treas. Reg. \u00a71.901-2(a)(2)(ii)(A), with respect to their \noperations in Country L.   \n \nCorp B, now known as Corp C, a wholly owned domestic subsidiary of Corp A, filed a \nsafe harbor election under Treas. Reg. \u00a71.901-2A(d)(3)(ii) with respect to Country L \nlevies paid or accrued by members of its consolidated group for Tax Year X and for \nsubsequent years.  That safe harbor election has not been revoked under \u00a71.901-\n2A(d)(4).   \n \nTreas. Reg. \u00a71.901-2A(c)(1) permits dual capacity taxpayers in computing foreign tax \ncredits for qualifying levies of each country to use either a \u201cfacts and circumstances\u201d \nmethod or a \u201dsafe harbor\u201d method to determine the amount of a levy that is not paid in \nexchange for a specific economic benefit. \n \nTreas. Reg. \u00a71.901-2A(d) describes the manner in which taxpayers may elect and \nrevoke the safe harbor method.  Treas. Reg. \u00a71.901-2A(d)(4) provides that the safe \nharbor method election may not be revoked without the consent of the Commissioner.  \nAn application for consent to revoke the election must be made not later than 30 days \nbefore the due date (including extensions) for the filing of the income tax return for the \nfirst taxable year for which the revocation is sought to be effective, with certain \nexceptions not applicable to this situation.  The Commissioner may make his consent to \nany revocation conditioned upon adjustments being made in one or more taxable years \nso as to prevent the revocation from resulting in a distortion of the amount of any item \nrelating to tax liability in any taxable year.  The Commissioner will normally consent to a \nrevocation under the circumstances described in \u00a71.901-2A(d)(4)(i) through (vi). \n \nTreas. Reg. \u00a71.901-2A(d)(4)(vi) provides that the Commissioner will normally consent to \na revocation of a safe harbor election if the election has been in effect with respect to at \nleast three taxable years prior to the taxable year for which the revocation is to be \neffective.   \n \nBased solely on the information and representations submitted, Corp A\u2019s application for \nconsent to revoke the safe harbor election with respect to qualifying levies of Country L \nwas made not later than 30 days before Date N, the due date (including extension) for \nCorp A\u2019s U.S. consolidated federal income tax return for Tax Year Y, and the applicable \nsafe harbor election has been in effect with respect to at least Corp A\u2019s last three \ntaxable years prior to Tax Year Y.

Taxpayer requests that the \nInternal Revenue Service rule that a Transaction (as described below) will be treated as \na real estate asset under sections 856(c)(4) and 856(c)(5)(B) of the Internal Revenue \nCode of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d).  Additionally, Taxpayer requests a ruling that \ngross income realized by Taxpayer from payments made under a Transaction will \ngenerate income that is treated as gain from the sale or other disposition of real \nproperty (including interests in real property and interests in mortgages on real property) \nPLR-123109-11\n2\nwhich is not property described in section 1221(a)(1) within the meaning of section \n856(c)(3)(C).  \nFacts\nTaxpayer is a limited partnership organized in State and is classified as a \npartnership for federal income tax purposes.  Taxpayer reports its income under the \naccrual method of accounting and its tax year ends December 31.\nTaxpayer and Sponsor intend to engage in a roll-up transaction whereby a \ncorporation or trust (\u201cNewco\u201d) will be formed that will elect and qualify as a real estate \ninvestment trust (\u201cREIT\u201d) for federal income tax purposes.  Taxpayer will serve as the \noperating partnership and will originate and own Transactions, which will be the only \nassets it owns other than property specifically permitted under section 856.\nTaxpayer invests in the potential long-term growth of residential real estate \nthrough Transactions.  Taxpayer is capitalized through capital contributions from \ninvestors and such capital contributions are used to fund and originate Transactions.  \nTaxpayer offers the Transaction to residential Property owners (\u201cHomeowners\u201d) \nbetween the ages of A and B.  Transactions are designed as an alternative to traditional \nmortgage loans.  Under a Transaction, participating Homeowners are paid an upfront \npayment (\u201cUpfront Payment\u201d) and in exchange grant to Taxpayer the right (the \n\u201cParticipation Right\u201d) to participate in the future growth in the value of the underlying \nproperty (\u201cProperty\u201d).  Taxpayer is unable to definitively determine the full income effect \nof the transaction until a future event (\u201cTrigger Event\u201d).\nThe Transaction begins with the submission of an application by an interested \nHomeowner.  Upon receipt of an application, Taxpayer performs a review and \nunderwrites the proposed transaction.  Based upon factors such as the value of the \nProperty (\u201cInitial Property Value\u201d), existing mortgage loans on the Property, location and \nother underwriting criteria, Taxpayer either approves or declines the Transaction.  \nBecause a Transaction is an asset-based transaction, the underwriting process is \nkeenly focused on the value of the Property.  If the application is approved, Taxpayer \nissues a proposed offer sheet that lists the Upfront Payment available to the \nHomeowner.  Upfront Payment amounts are a percentage of the Initial Property Value.  \nEach Upfront Payment has a corresponding Appreciation Participation Rate.  \n\u201cAppreciation Participation Rate\u201d is the rate at which Taxpayer and the Homeowner \nparticipate in the appreciation, if any, of the Property.  Appreciation Participation Rates \nrange in value depending on the Upfront Payment paid to the Homeowner.  \nHomeowners select the Upfront Payment they desire, as well as the corresponding \nAppreciation Participation Rate they are comfortable providing to Taxpayer.  The \namount paid to a Homeowner for an Upfront Payment is not required to be repaid, \nexcept in the event a Trigger Event terminates a Transaction within D years.\nPLR-123109-11\n3\nTrigger Events under the Transaction are: (i) an uncured breach by the \nHomeowner of the Participation Right Agreement (e.g. default on the primary mortgage \nloan, or failure to maintain insurance or pay utilities, taxes, etc.,); (ii) the sale/transfer of \nthe Property, including a transfer that results from the death of the Homeowner; or (iii) C \nyears from the origination of the Participation Right (or sooner based upon states\u2019 rules \nagainst perpetuity laws).  Upon a Trigger Event, Taxpayer is entitled to exercise its \nrights under the Participation Right Agreement and receive a cash settlement amount \nof: (i) the Early Termination Charge (as defined below) if the Participation Right \nAgreement is terminated by a Trigger Event within the first D years; or, (ii) its share of \nappreciation, if any, based upon the Appreciation Participate Rate (the \u201cSettlement \nAmount\u201d).\nTransactions are intended to be long-term transactions.  It is anticipated the \nmajority of the Transactions will mature (or become exercisable) at a period of greater \nthan D years.  In the event a Trigger Event terminates a Transaction within the first D \nyears from its origination, an Early Termination Charge applies.  Under a Transaction, \nthe \u201cEarly Termination Charge\u201d equals the greater of: (i) the amount paid by Taxpayer to \noriginate the Participation Right, which equals the Upfront Payment plus its origination \ncost (collectively, the \u201cParticipation Right Cost\u201d), plus interest on the Participation Right \nCost at an annual compounding rate of D percent or, (ii) Taxpayer\u2019s share of \nappreciation at the time of termination.\nAppreciation under a Transaction is measured by the Index that covers the \nmetropolitan area in which the Property is located.  At the time the Transaction is \noriginated, the value of the Index is used as the \u201cBeginning Index Value.\u201d  At the end of \nthe Transaction, the value of the Index at that time establishes the \u201cEnding Index \nValue.\u201d  If the Ending Index Value is greater than the Beginning Index Value, the \npercentage increase is used to calculate the appreciation of the Property.\nThe Index is used to measure appreciation (as opposed to an appraisal) due to \nefficiency, transparency and fairness concerns.  Using the Index, for example, prevents \na potential dispute concerning accuracy and the added expense of additional back-end \nappraisals.  In addition, in the event the Homeowner improves the Property and the \nimprovement results in an increase in value to the Property, Taxpayer is entitled to only \nthe amount owed as determined by the Index regardless of the increased value from the \nimprovements.  Finally, the Index adds an element of objectivity and transparency for \nthe Homeowner participating in a Transaction. \nTransactions are secured by a performance mortgage (or performance deed of \ntrust, depending on state requirements) recorded against the subject Property\u2019s title.  \nAdditionally, Taxpayer records a memorandum of option on the Property\u2019s title to \nprovide public notice of an interest in the Property.  Each performance mortgage is a \nlien against the Property, and Taxpayer is the mortgagee, with all rights and privileges, \nPLR-123109-11\n4\nunder the mortgage.  The performance mortgage is intended to secure the \nHomeowner\u2019s performance under the Transaction.  No stated sum certain is listed in the \nperformance mortgage due to the uncertainty of the Transaction.\nAs described above, Taxpayer makes an Upfront Payment to a Homeowner and \nin exchange receives the right to share in the potential future appreciation of the \nProperty.  Taxpayer records a performance mortgage against the Property to secure \nand provide notice of its interest in the Property.  At the end of the Transaction, \nTaxpayer is entitled to either: (i) the Early Termination Charge (if applicable); or (ii) its \nshare of appreciation, if any, which is gain from the sale or disposition of the Property \nsecured by the mortgage.  Appreciation is calculated using the Index described above. \nIf the Transaction ends after D years from the date of its origination and there is no \nappreciation, Taxpayer is not entitled to any payment.  In this case, the Homeowner \nkeeps the Upfront Payment and Taxpayer suffers a loss on its investment in the \nProperty.  \nLaw and Analysis\nSection 856(c)(5)(B) of the Code defines the term \u201creal estate assets\u201d, in part, to \nmean real property (including interests in real property and interests in mortgages on \nreal property) and shares (or transferable certificates of beneficial interest) in other \nREITs.  Section 856(c)(5)(C) provides that the term \u201cinterests in real property\u201d includes \nfee ownership and co-ownership of land or improvements thereon, leaseholds of land or \nimprovements thereon, options to acquire land or improvements thereon, and options to \nacquire leaseholds of land or improvements thereon, but does not include mineral, oil, \nor gas royalty interests.\nSection 856(c)(3) provides that, to qualify as a REIT for any taxable year under \npart II of subchapter M, an entity must derive at least 75 percent of its gross income \n(excluding gross income from prohibited transactions) from sources listed in section \n856(c)(3), which also includes gain from the sale or other disposition of real property \n(including interests in real property and interests in mortgages on real property) which is \nnot property described in section 1221(a)(1). \nSection 1.856-3(b)(1) of the Income Tax Regulations (the \u201cRegulations\u201d) provides \nthat the term \u201creal estate assets\u201d means real property, interests in mortgages on real \nproperty (including interests in mortgages on leaseholds of land or other improvements \nthereon), and shares in other qualified REITs.  Section 1.856-3(c) provides that \n\"interests in real property\" includes fee ownership and co-ownership of land or \nimprovements thereon, leaseholds of land or improvements thereon, options to acquire \nland or improvements thereon, and options to acquire leaseholds of land or \nimprovements thereon. \nPLR-123109-11\n5\nUnder section 1.856-3(g) of the Regulations, a REIT that is a partner in a \npartnership is deemed to own its proportionate share of each of the assets of the \npartnership and to be entitled to the income of the partnership attributable to that share. \nFor purposes of section 856, the interest of a partner in the partnership's assets is \ndetermined in accordance with the partner's capital interest in the partnership.  The \ncharacter of the various assets in the hands of the partnership and items of gross \nincome of the partnership retain the same character in the hands of the partners for all \npurposes of section 856. \nIn the instant case, the Transaction is secured by a performance mortgage (or \nperformance deed of trust) recorded against the subject Property\u2019s title.  As described \nabove, each performance mortgage is a lien against the Property with all rights and \nprivileges under the mortgage.  The Transaction arises through an agreement between \nTaxpayer and Homeowner with respect to real property.  In addition to authorizing the \nTransaction, the Homeowner enters into the Participation Right Agreement and a \nperformance mortgage (or performance deed of trust) for the benefit of Taxpayer in \nexchange for the Upfront Payment.  The Participation Right Agreement and \nperformance mortgage (or performance deed of trust) attach an interest on the real \nproperty securing the Participation Right.  Accordingly, a Transaction is secured by an \ninterest in the underlying real property.  To the extent a Transaction is fully secured by \nreal property, it qualifies as a real estate asset within the meaning of sections 856(c)(4) \nand 856(c)(5)(B).  In addition, when a Transaction is terminated and the Taxpayer \nreceives an Early Termination Charge or its share of appreciation of the Property, if any, \nsuch amount is gain from the sale or other disposition of real property (including \ninterests in real property and interests in mortgages on real property) which is not \nproperty described in section 1221(a)(1) within the meaning of section 856(c)(3)(C). \nConclusion\nBased on the facts as represented by Taxpayer, we rule that, to the extent a \nTransaction is fully secured by real property, it qualifies as a real estate asset within the \nmeaning of sections 856(c)(4) and 856(c)(5)(B).  In addition, we rule that gross income \nrealized by Taxpayer under a Transaction constitutes gain from the sale or other \ndisposition of real property (including interests in real property and interests in \nmortgages on real property) which is not property described in section 1221(a)(1) within \nthe meaning of section 856(c)(3)(C). \nExcept as specifically ruled upon above, no opinion is expressed concerning any \nfederal income tax consequences relating to the facts herein under any other provision \nof the Code. Specifically, we do not rule whether Newco otherwise will qualify as a REIT \nunder part II of subchapter M of Chapter 1 of the Code.\nPLR-123109-11\n6\nThis ruling is directed only to the taxpayer requesting it.  Taxpayer and Newco \nshould attach a copy of this ruling to each tax return to which it applies.  Section \n6110(k)(3) of the Code provides that it may not be used or cited as precedent.\nSincerely,\nThomas M. Preston\nThomas M.

PT, Affiliate and Related Party also request rulings on the manner in \nwhich the identification and replacement period rules apply in the transactions.\nFACTS:\n1.\nPT\u2019s Organizational Identity and Structure.\nPT is a limited partnership.  Parent is a real estate investment trust (REIT).  PT is the \noperating partnership for Parent, which operates through an UPREIT structure.  Parent \nowns 95.5 percent of the interests in PT and is its sole general partner.  Various outside \npartners own the remaining 4.5 percent of the interests in PT.  PT conducts its \noperations and owns properties directly and through various subsidiary entities, \nincluding single-member limited liability companies that are disregarded for federal \nincome tax purposes.  One of these is LLC#1, the owner of PT\u2019s relinquished property \n(RQ).\nPT also has interests in other subsidiary entities that are not disregarded for federal \nincome tax purposes.  One of these is Affiliate, which is a limited partnership that is \n99.99 percent owned by PT.  The other .01 percent is held by Holding, a corporation.  \nPT owns 100 percent of Holding.  Parent and Holding have jointly elected to treat \nHolding as a taxable REIT subsidiary under \u00a7 856(l) of the Code.   Another of these \nentities is Related Party, a limited liability company 99 percent owned by Taxpayer and \n1% by Subsidiary.  Subsidiary is a corporation that is wholly owned by Parent. \n2.\nThe Exchange Transactions.\nA. PT\u2019s Exchange\nPT engaged in a deferred like-kind exchange through a qualified intermediary (QI) and a \nqualified trustee (QT) under an exchange agreement and a qualified exchange trust \nagreement.1  On Date 1, PT (by its wholly-owned LLC#1), pursuant to the exchange \nagreement and a prior sales agreement, conveyed RQ by direct deed to Unrelated \nBuyer for $x.  \nOn Date 2, PT timely identified replacement property (RP) as a potential replacement \nproperty for RQ, along with two other potential replacement properties.  RP was owned \n                                           \n1 The term \u201cqualified exchange trust agreement\u201d as used in this letter is the type of trust agreement \ndescribed in \u00a7 1.1031(k)-1(g)(3)(iii) of the Income Tax Regulations.  Taxpayer describes specific steps in \nthese combined transactions, including Taxpayers entering into exchange agreements, qualified \nexchange trust agreements, assignments, notices of assignments, etc., and represents that PT, Affiliate \nand Related Party are meeting all requirements for deferral in these transactions under the safe harbor \nrules of the regulations and other relevant published guidance.  Since these steps are not directly relevant \nto the rulings sought by Taxpayer, this letter will not describe them with the same amount of detail given \nin Taxpayer\u2019s ruling application.    \nPLR-134451-11\n3\nby Affiliate through its wholly-owned limited liability company, Affiliate LLC, a \ndisregarded entity for federal income tax purposes.\nOn Date 3, PT timely acquired RP when it acquired from Affiliate 100 percent of the \nmembership interest of Affiliate LLC for $y, an amount exceeding the sales price of RQ.\nB. Affiliate\u2019s Exchange \nAffiliate entered into an exchange agreement and a qualified exchange trust agreement \nto facilitate the exchange of RP (Affiliate RQ) for like-kind replacement property (Affiliate \nRP).  At the closing of the transfer of RP (which was Affiliate RQ) to PT, the net \nproceeds were received by Affiliate\u2019s QI and QT.  On Date 4, Affiliate timely identified \nthree properties as potential replacement properties for Affiliate RQ.  One of these \nidentified properties is held by Related Party.  \nIf Affiliate acquires Affiliate RP at a cost that is less than the amount realized on the \ndisposition of Affiliate RQ, the difference will result in Affiliate recognizing gain equal to \nthe difference.  However, Affiliate represents that the amount of gain Affiliate will have to \nrecognize as a result of acquiring Affiliate RP for less than the amount realized for \nAffiliate RQ will not exceed 5 percent of the gain realized by Affiliate on its disposition of \nAffiliate RQ.  \nC. Additional Related Party Exchanges\nTo the extent any Affiliate RP is acquired from Related Party, prior to transfer of such \nproperty to Affiliate, Related Party will enter into a deferred exchange agreement with a \nQI providing for the Related Party\u2019s exchange of Affiliate RP that it transfers to Affiliate. \nThus the Affiliate RP to be transferred by Related Party will be Related Party\u2019s \nrelinquished property (Related Party RQ).  \nBefore the expiration of the statutory identification period, Related Party will identify \npotential replacement properties (Related Party RP).  All potential Related Party RP will \nbe owned by parties unrelated to PT, Affiliate and Related Party.  Related Party will \nacquire ownership of some or all of the potential Related Party RP within the \nreplacement period provided in \u00a7 1031(a)(3)(B).\nIf Related Party acquires Related Party RP through a QI at a cost that is less than the \namount realized on the disposition of Related Party RQ, the difference will result in \nRelated Party recognizing gain equal to the difference.  However, Related Party \nrepresents that the amount of gain Related Party will have to recognize will not exceed \n5 percent of the gain realized by Related Party on its disposition of the Related Party \nRQ.  \n  \nPLR-134451-11\n4\nPT, Affiliate and Related Party receiving replacement properties from related parties in \nthe series of exchanges described in this letter will hold their replacement properties for \nat least two years following the date of the acquisition of the last property acquired by \nany of the parties in these described transactions.\nAPPLICABLE LAW & ANALYSIS:\nApplication of \u00a7 1031(f)\nSection 1031(a)(1) of the Code provides that no gain or loss is recognized on the \nexchange of property held for productive use in a trade or business or for investment if \nthe property is exchanged solely for property of like kind to be held either for productive \nuse in a trade or business or for investment.\nSection 1031(f)(1) provides that if--(A) a taxpayer exchanges property with a related \nperson, (B) there is nonrecognition of gain or loss to the taxpayer under \u00a7 1031 on the \nexchange of such property (determined without regard to \u00a7 1031(f)), and (C) before the \ndate 2 years after the date of the last transfer that was part of the exchange\u2014\n   (i) the related person disposes of the property, or \n   (ii) the taxpayer disposes of the property received in the exchange from the related \nperson that was of like kind to the property transferred by the taxpayer, \nthere is no nonrecognition of gain or loss under \u00a7 1031 to the taxpayer on the \nexchange.  Any gain or loss recognized by the taxpayer by reason of \u00a71031(f) must be \ntaken into account as of the date on which the disposition referred to in (C) occurs. \nSection 1031(f)(2)(C) provides that, for purposes of the application of \u00a7 1031(f)(1)(C),  a \ndisposition is not taken into account if it is established to the satisfaction of the \nSecretary that neither the exchange nor the disposition had as one of its principal \npurposes the avoidance of federal income tax.    \nSection 1031(f)(4) provides that \u00a7 1031 does not apply to any exchange that is part of a \ntransaction (or series of transactions) structured to avoid the purposes of \u00a7 1031(f). \nSection 1031(f)(1) is not applicable to PT\u2019s exchange of RQ for RP because PT is \nexchanging property with QI, who is not a related person to PT.  The same is true of the \nseparate exchanges of Affiliate and Related Party.  However, under \u00a7 1031(f)(4), if PT \n(or Affiliate or Related Party) is using a QI or EAT to structure its transactions with tax \navoidance as one of its principal purposes, \u00a7 1031 will not apply to the exchange.  See, \ne.g., Teruya Brothers Ltd. v. Commissioner, 580 F.3d 1038 (9th Cir. 2009); Ocmulgee \nFields v. Commissioner, 613 F.3d1360 (11th Cir. 2010); and Rev. Rul. 2002-83, 2002-2 \nC.B. 927.\nPLR-134451-11\n5\nBoth the House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee \ndisclosed the policy concern that led to the enactment of \u00a7 1031(f):\nBecause a like-kind exchange results in the substitution of the basis of the \nexchanged property for the property received, related parties have \nengaged in like-kind exchanges of high basis property for low basis \nproperty in anticipation of the sale of the low basis property in order to \nreduce or avoid the recognition of gain on the subsequent sale.  Basis \nshifting also can be used to accelerate a loss on the retained property.  \nThe committee believes that if a related party exchange is followed shortly \nthereafter by a disposition of the property, the related parties have, in \neffect, cashed out of the investment, and the original exchange should not \nbe accorded nonrecognition treatment.  \nH.R. Rep. No. 247, 101st Cong., 1st Sess., 1340 (1989); S. Print. No. 56, at 151 (1989).  \nThe Senate Finance Committee Print, however, also gives three examples of fact \nsituations for which it is deemed established for purposes of \u00a7 1031(f)(2(C) that neither \nthe exchange nor such disposition had as one of its principal purposes the avoidance of \nfederal income tax.  One of the three involves \u201c. . . dispositions of property in \nnonrecognition transactions.\u201d   S. Print. No. 56, 152.  \nIn the present case, the only acquisitions of replacement property from related entities \nwill be as part of subsequent like-kind exchanges by these related entities, which will \nsubstantially constitute nonrecognition transactions.  Affiliate will be relinquishing \nproperty to PT as part of its own like-kind exchange with Related Party and Related \nParty will relinquish property to Affiliate as part of its separate like-kind exchange for \nreplacement property from one or more unrelated parties.  Since both Affiliate and \nRelated Party are also structuring their respective dispositions of property as exchanges \nfor like-kind replacement property, neither \u00a7 1031(f)(1) nor (f)(4) will apply to trigger gain \nrecognition in PT\u2019s exchanges or to disqualify the application of \u00a7 1031 to any exchange \nin this series of transactions.  \nFurthermore, there is no material cashing out by any of the related parties within 2 years \nof the last transfer in the series of transactions because neither Taxpayer, Affiliate nor \nRelated Party will receive non-like-kind replacement property greater than 5 percent of \nthe gain realized on disposition of relinquished property.  Upon completion of the series \nof transactions, all related parties will own the properties received in these exchanges \nthat are of like kind to the properties exchanged for at least two years after the date of \nthe last transfer in the series. \nApplication of the identification and replacement period rules\nPLR-134451-11\n6\nSection 1031(a)(3) provides that for purposes of \u00a7 1031(a), any property received by the \ntaxpayer is treated as not like-kind property if\u2014\n     (A) the property is not identified as property to be received in the exchange on or \nbefore the day which is 45 days after the date on which the taxpayer transfers the \nproperty relinquished in the exchange, or \n     (B) the property is received after the earlier of\u2014\n           (i) the day which is 180 days after the date on which the taxpayer transfers the \nproperty relinquished in the exchange, or \n          (ii) the due date (determined with regard to extension) for the transferor\u2019s return of \nthe tax imposed by this chapter for the taxable year in which the transfer of the \nrelinquished property occurs. \nSection 1.1031(k)-1(c)(4) provides rules limiting the number and the fair market value of \npotential replacement properties that exchanging taxpayers may identify prior to their \nreceipt of replacement property.  \nIn the present case, PT, Affiliate and Related Party represent that they are separate \ntaxpayers that will separately report the results of any exchange, including the \nrealization and recognition of gain or loss on the dispositions.  Thus, each must be \nregarded as undertaking its own exchange transaction with an identification and \nreplacement period that would apply separately to that party\u2019s exchange.  Thus, for \nexample, Date 1 would be the day on which PT\u2019s 45-day identification period would \nbegin, whereas Affiliate\u2019s identification period would begin when Affiliate transfers its \nRQ and Related Party\u2019s identification period begins when Related Party transfers its \nRQ.  Similarly, each party would separately apply the limits on identification of multiple \nor alternative properties under \u00a71.1031(k)-1(c)(4).\nRULINGS: \n1. Section 1031(f)(1) and (f)(4) of the Code do not apply to disqualify PT from the \nbenefits of \u00a7 1031(a) in its exchanges with related parties provided that (A) each \nrelated party transferring replacement property into the exchanges described in this \nletter is also engaging in its own like-kind exchange and (B) PT, Affiliate and Related \nParty hold their replacement properties for at least two years after the date of the \nlast transfer of property in the exchanges.\n2. Receipt by Affiliate or Related Party of non-like-kind property equal to no more \nthan 5 percent of the gain realized by Affiliate or Related Party, respectively, in its \nexchange will not result in the application of \u00a7 1031(f) to PT in its exchange.  \n3. Each transfer of relinquished property by PT, Affiliate or Related Party in its \nseparate exchange will result in a separate identification period and replacement \nPLR-134451-11\n7\nperiod provided in \u00a7 1031(a)(3) commencing on the date of the respective party\u2019s \ninitial transfer of relinquished property.  \n4.  Each transfer of relinquished property by PT, Affiliate or Related Party in its \nseparate exchange will result in a separate application of the limits on identification \nof multiple or alternative replacement properties provided in \u00a71.1031(k)-1(c)(4).\nCAVEATS:\nExcept as expressly provided herein, no opinion is expressed or implied concerning the \ntax consequences of any aspect of any transaction or item discussed or referenced in \nthis letter. This ruling is directed only to the taxpayers requesting it.  Section 6110(k)(3) \nof the Code provides that it may not be used or cited as precedent.\nA copy of this letter must be attached to any income tax return to which it is relevant. \nAlternatively, taxpayers filing their returns electronically may satisfy this requirement by \nattaching a statement to their return that provides the date and control number of the \nletter ruling.\nThe ruling contained in this letter is based upon information and representations \nsubmitted by PT, Affiliate and Related Party and accompanied by a penalty of perjury \nstatement executed by an appropriate party.   This ruling is also based upon the \nrepresentation that PT, Affiliate and Related Party receiving replacement properties \nfrom related parties in the series of exchanges described in this letter will hold their \nreplacement properties for at least two years following the date of the acquisition of the \nlast property acquired by any of the parties in these described transactions.\nWhile this office has not verified any of the material submitted in support of the request \nfor rulings, it is subject to verification on examination.\nSincerely,\nMichael J.

The\nLiving Trust was drafted by Attorney.  Wife and Husband were residents of State A, a\nseparate property state.  However, they did own some real property in State B, a\ncommunity property state, that was transferred to the Living Trust.\nUnder Article 8, Section 1 of the Living Trust, on the death of the first to die of\nHusband and Wife, the trustee is to divide the trust property into two separate\nirrevocable trusts, the Marital Trust and the Family Trust.  Article 8, Section 1.a.\nprovides that the Marital Trust is to consist of the surviving spouse\u2019s community portion\nof the trust property, surviving spouse\u2019s separate property, and a fractional share of the\ndeceased spouse\u2019s property such that the Marital Trust receives the \u201csmallest amount\nwhich, if allowed as a marital deduction, would result in the least federal estate tax\nbeing payable as a result of the deceased spouse\u2019s death after allowing for the unified\ncredit and the credit for state death taxes.\u201d  Article 8, Section 1.b. provides that the\nFamily Trust is to consist of the balance of the Living Trust assets.\nArticle 9 of the Living Trust provides that the surviving spouse is to receive\nmonthly payments of all the net income of the Marital Trust.  In addition, trustee is to\npay to the surviving spouse, during life, such amounts from the principal of the Marital\nTrust as the surviving spouse may request.  On the surviving spouse\u2019s death, the\nsurviving spouse is granted a general testamentary power to appoint trust corpus.\nArticle 10, Section 1 of the Living Trust provides that the trustee may distribute\nincome and principal from the Family Trust to the surviving spouse solely for the\nspouse\u2019s education, health, maintenance, and support.  Any income not distributed by\nthe trustee is to be accumulated and added to principal.  Article 10, Section 2 states\nthat the surviving spouse has a testamentary nongeneral power to appoint the principal\nand any undistributed net income of the Family Trust among the Husband\u2019s and Wife\u2019s\ndescendants.  The spouse has the power to appoint in equal or unequal amounts\namong the descendants, but cannot appoint to the spouse\u2019s estate, the creditors of\nspouse\u2019s estate, or in any manner which would result in any economic benefit to\nspouse.\nArticle 12 provides that upon the death of the surviving spouse, any remaining\nprincipal or undistributed income from the Family Trust, or the Marital Trust, in default of\nexercise of the spouse\u2019s power of appointment, shall be distributed among the\ndescendants of Husband and Wife.\nHusband died on Date 2, survived by Wife.  Under Article 15, Section 3.d., Wife\nbecame the sole trustee of Living Trust on Husband\u2019s death.\n3\nPLR-132982-01\nPreparer prepared a federal estate tax return (Form 706) on Date 4.  On\nSchedule M of Form 706, the estate claimed an estate tax marital deduction for the\nvalue of the entire Living Trust residue passing to both the Marital and Family Trusts. \nThe schedule as filed did not reflect that the Living Trust residue was to be divided into\na Marital Trust and a Family Trust, and that only the Marital Trust qualified for an estate\ntax marital deduction.\nWife has filed a complaint in County Court in State A against Preparer and\nAttorney for failure to advise Wife on administration matters of the Living Trust\nsubsequent to the death of Husband.  The County Court ordered on Date 5, amended\nby the order on Date 6, that Wife, serving as trustee, fund the Family Trust with $x in\nassets as of Date 3, per the values listed on Form 706.  The Family Trust is to be\nfunded with assets that are fairly representative of appreciation and depreciation of the\nentire fund between the date of Husband\u2019s death and the date of funding.  The order of\nthe County Court is stayed until such time as a favorable ruling is issued here.  If a\nfavorable ruling is not issued, the order of the County Court will be null and void.\nLAW AND ANALYSIS\nRuling 1\nSection 2501(a) imposes a tax on the transfer of property by gift.  Section\n2505(a) allows a unified credit against the tax imposed by section 2501 for the\napplicable credit amount in effect under section 2010(c).\nIn the instant case, the court order directs Wife, as trustee of the Trust, to\nestablish and fund the Family Trust and the Marital Trust, in accordance with the terms\nof the Living Trust.  Under the terms of the Living Trust, the assets passing to the\nFamily Trust are to consist solely of Husband\u2019s assets that are includible in his gross\nestate.  \nPursuant to the court order, Wife is to fund the Family Trust based on the value\nof the assets as reported on Form 706 filed for Husband\u2019s estate, using assets that are\nrepresentative of appreciation and depreciation of the entire fund between the date of\ndeath and the date of funding.  Under these circumstances, we conclude the transfer of\nLiving Trust assets by Wife, as trustee to the Family Trust, pursuant to the Court order,\nwill not constitute a gift for gift tax purposes under section 2501.\nRuling 2\nSection 2036(a) provides that a decedent\u2019s gross estate shall include the value\nof all property with respect to any interest therein that has been transferred by the\ndecedent by trust or otherwise, in which the decedent has retained for life (1) the\npossession or enjoyment of, or right to the income from, the property, or (2) the right to\ndesignate the person who shall possess or enjoy the property or income therefrom. \nSection 2036 is applicable only with regard to an interest in property that has been\n4\nPLR-132982-01\ntransferred by the decedent.  Transfers by others, which create rights in the decedent,\ndo not invoke the provisions of this section.\nIn this case, as discussed above, the court order directs Wife, as trustee of the\nLiving Trust, to fund the Family Trust and the Marital Trust in accordance with the terms\nof the Living Trust.  As noted above, as directed by the terms of Living Trust, the\nproperty which Wife proposes to transfer to Family Trust is the property of Husband\nheld by the Living Trust.  The Family Trust will be funded based on the value of the\nassets as reported on Form 706, using assets that are fairly representative of the\nappreciation and depreciation of the entire fund between the date of death and the date\nof funding.  We conclude that the assets transferred to the Family Trust will not be\nincludible in Wife\u2019s gross estate under section 2036.\nRuling 3\nSection 2056(a) provides that, except as limited by section 2056(b), the value of\na taxable estate is determined by deducting from the value of the gross estate an\namount equal to the value of any interest in property which passes or has passed from\nthe decedent to the surviving spouse. \nSection 2056(b)(1) denies a marital deduction for an interest passing to the\nsurviving spouse that is a \"terminable interest.\" An interest is a terminable interest if the\ninterest passing to the surviving spouse will terminate or fail on the lapse of time or on\nthe occurrence of an event or contingency or on the failure of an event or contingency\nto occur, and on termination, the interest passes to someone other than the surviving\nspouse. \nSection 2056(b)(7)(A) provides an exception to this terminable interest rule in the\ncase of qualified terminable interest property (QTIP).  For purposes of section 2056(a),\nqualified terminable interest property is treated as passing to the surviving spouse, and\nno part of the property is treated as passing to any person other than the surviving\nspouse.  Under section 2056(b)(7)(B)(i), QTIP is property which passes from the\ndecedent, in which the surviving spouse has a qualifying income interest for life, and to\nwhich an election under section 2056(b)(7)(B)(v) applies.  Under section\n2056(b)(7)(B)(ii), the spouse has a qualifying income interest for life if the spouse is\nentitled to all the income from the property, payable at least annually, and no person\nhas the power to appoint any part of the property other than the surviving spouse.\nSection 2056(b)(7)(B)(v) provides that the election to treat property as QTIP\nunder section 2056(b)(7) is made by the executor on the return of tax imposed by\nsection 2001. This election, once made, is irrevocable. \nSection 2044 provides that the value of the gross estate shall include the value\nof any property with respect to which the decedent had a qualifying income interest for\nlife and a deduction under section 2056(b)(7) was previously allowed.\n5\nPLR-132982-01\nIn this case, the estate claimed a marital deduction for the entire Living Trust on\nSchedule M of Form 706 filed for Husband\u2019s estate.  That portion of the Living Trust\nassets passing to the Marital Trust representing Husband\u2019s property qualifies for the\nmarital deduction under section 2056(b)(5) (life estate coupled with a general power of\nappointment).  Regarding the portion of the Living Trust allocable to the Family Trust,\nthe estate, by claiming a marital deduction for these assets on Schedule M, purported\nto make a QTIP election with respect to these assets.  However, as stated above, under\nthe terms of the Family Trust, income is payable to Wife at the discretion of one trustee. \nAccordingly, Wife was not entitled, for life, to all the income from the trust, and therefore\ndid not receive a qualifying income interest for life in the Family Trust under\nsection 2056(b)(7)(B)(ii).  Accordingly, the Family Trust is not qualified terminable\ninterest property.  Under the facts presented in this case, the Family Trust will not be\nincludible in the gross estate of Wife under section 2044.  Compare, Estate of Letts v.\nCommissioner, 109 T.C. 290 (1997). \nIn accordance with the Power of Attorney on file with this office, a copy of this\nletter is being sent to your authorized representatives.\nExcept as expressly provided herein, no opinion is expressed or implied\nconcerning the tax consequences of any aspect of any transaction or item discussed or\nreferenced in this letter.\nThe rulings contained in this letter are based upon information and\nrepresentations submitted by the taxpayer and accompanied by a penalty of perjury\nstatement executed by an appropriate party.

X has elected to be treated \nas a regulated investment company (\u201cRIC\u201d) for purposes of Subtitle A, Chapter 1, \nSubchapter M of the Code. \n \n \nPLR-129206-05 \n \n2 \n \nX uses the accrual method of accounting for tax and financial accounting \npurposes, and uses the calendar year for tax and financial reporting purposes. \n \n \nMore than six years ago (on Date), X elected under section 4982(e)(4)(A) of the \nCode to use the twelve-month period ending December 31 for purposes of calculating \nthe required distribution of capital gain net income under section 4982(b)(1)(B) to avoid \npayment of an excise tax under section 4982(a).  This period was also used to \ndetermine the treatment of foreign currency gains and losses pursuant to section \n4982(e)(5). \n \n \nX believed that the election under section 4982 would relieve the administrative \nburden associated with dual calculations of capital gains and losses under the excise \ntax and subchapter M provisions of the Code.  However, X\u2019s experience has been that \nthe section 4982(e)(4)(A) election has created additional administrative burdens \nprimarily due to time constraints in declaring required excise tax distributions.  \nFurthermore, the promulgation of regulations coordinating the excise tax and \nsubchapter M provisions has greatly reduced the administrative burden of having a tax \nyear different form the period used for determining its required distribution under section \n4982.   \n \nAccordingly, X seeks consent to revoke its election under section 4982(e)(4)(A) \nto use its taxable year for purposes of sections 4982(b) and 4982(e). \n \nX represents that: \n \n1. X\u2019s desire to revoke its elections is due to administrative and non-tax-\nrelated financial burdens caused by the election; \n \n2. X is not seeking to revoke its election in order to preserve or secure a tax \nbenefit; \n \n3.  X will neither benefit through hindsight, nor prejudice the interests of the \ngovernment if permitted to revoke its election; and \n \n4.  X will not make a subsequent election under section 4982(e)(4)(A) of the       \nCode for at least five calendar years following the year of the grant of \nrevocation. \n \nAPPLICABLE LAW \n \n \nSection 4982(a) of the Code imposes an excise tax on every RIC for each \ncalendar year equal to 4 percent of the excess of the \u201crequired distribution\u201d for the \ncalendar year over the \u201cdistributed amount\u201d for the calendar year. \n \n \nPLR-129206-05 \n \n3 \n \nSection 4982(b)(1) defines \u201crequired distribution\u201d to mean, with respect to any \ncalendar year, the sum of 98 percent of the RIC\u2019s ordinary income for such calendar \nyear, plus 98 percent of its capital gain net income for the 1-year period ending on \nOctober 31 of such calendar year. \n \n \nSection 4982(e)(4)(A) provides that if the tax year of a RIC ends with the month \nof November or December, the RIC may elect to have the capital gain net income for its \ntaxable year applied in lieu of the 1-year period ending on October 31 of the calendar \nyear for purposes of satisfying the required distribution defined in section 4982(b)(1).  \nSection 4982(e)(4)(B) provides that, once made, such election may be revoked only \nwith the consent of the Secretary. \n \n \nSection 4982(e)(5) provides that any foreign currency gain or loss attributable to \na section 988 transaction and which is properly taken into account for the portion of the \ncalendar year after October 31 shall not be taken into account in determining the \nordinary income of the RIC for the calendar year but shall be taken into account in \ndetermining the RIC\u2019s ordinary income in the following calendar year.  However, if a RIC \nhas made an election under section 4982(e)(4), the preceding sentence shall be applied \nby substituting the last day of the RIC\u2019s taxable year for October 31. \n \n \n \n \n \nANALYSIS and CONCLUSION \n \n \nBased on the information submitted and the representations made, we conclude \nthat X\u2019s desire to revoke its election under section 4982(e)(4)(A) is because of \nadministrative burdens and not because of any federal tax-related financial burden \ncaused by the election.  X does not seek to revoke its election for the purpose of \npreserving or securing a federal tax benefit.  Additionally, X will neither benefit through \nhindsight nor prejudice the interests of the government as a result of being permitted to \nrevoke its election. \n \nAccordingly, it is held as follows: \n \n1.  Pursuant to section 4982(e)(4)(B), the Secretary consents to the revocation of         \nthe election made by X under section 4982(e)(4)(A) effective for Year and \nsubsequent years. \n \n2.  X\u2019s calculation of its capital gain net income under section 4982(b)(1) and \nsection 4982(e)(2) shall be determined on the basis of capital gains and losses \nand foreign currency gains and losses realized and recognized during the ten-\nmonth period from January 1 of Year through October 31 of Year. \n \n \nAs a condition to the Secretary\u2019s consent to the revocation pursuant to section \n4982(e)(4)(B), X may not make a subsequent election under section 4982(e)(4)(A) for a \nperiod of 5 calendar years following the year to which the grant of revocation applies. \n \n \nPLR-129206-05 \n \n4 \nExcept as expressly provided herein, no opinion is expressed or implied \nconcerning the tax consequences of any aspect of any transaction or item discussed or \nreferenced in this letter, including whether X qualifies as a RIC. \n \nThis ruling is directed only to the taxpayer requesting it.  Section 6110(k)(3) of \nthe Code provides that it may not be used or cited as precedent. \n \nIn accordance with the Power of Attorney on file with this office, a copy of this \nletter is being sent to your authorized representative. \n \nA copy of this letter must be attached to any income tax return to which it is \nrelevant. \n \nSincerely, \n \n \nWilliam E.

The\ninformation submitted for consideration is summarized below.\nCompany is a domestic corporation engaged in Business A. On Date 3, the date\nof death of Decedent, Company had outstanding A shares of voting common stock, B\nshares of nonvoting common stock, C shares cumulative voting preferred stock (which\nbecame nonvoting at Decedent\u2019s death), and D shares of nonvoting preferred stock. On\nDate 3: over half of the voting common stock was held by Decedent\u2019s daughter\n(\u201cDaughter\u201d); over half of both the voting and nonvoting preferred stock ( m shares\nvoting and n shares nonvoting) was held by a revocable trust ( \u201cRevocable Trust\u201d).  All\nthe other stock in Company is held by, or for the benefit of, Decedent\u2019s children and\ngrandchildren, and/or persons married to the children. \nDecedent, a State B resident, died on Date 3 survived by Daughter, Son, and\nthree grandchildren.  On Decedent\u2019s Form 706, United States Estate (and Generation\nSkipping Transfer) Tax Return, the executor of Decedent\u2019s estate (\u201cEstate\u201d) elected to\ndeduct the value of Decedent\u2019s qualified family-owned business interests (\u201cQFOBI\u201d)\nunder section 2057 of the Internal Revenue Code, and claimed the maximum allowable\n$675,000 deduction.  Decedent\u2019s QFOBI consisted of the Company stock (m shares of\nvoting preferred and n shares of nonvoting preferred) held by Decedent indirectly\nthrough Revocable Trust.  By a letter dated Date 4, the Internal Revenue Service\naccepted Decedent\u2019s estate tax return.\nRevocable Trust was established on Date 1 through an agreement between\nDecedent (as grantor) and Decedent and his wife (as trustees).  On Date 2, Decedent\namended and restated Revocable Trust in its entirety, with Revocable Trust being\nestablished for the benefit of Decedent, Daughter, and other descendants of Decedent. \nPursuant to Article VI, section D of Revocable Trust, the property passing under Articles\nIII and IV bears the excess costs, including funeral and estate administration expenses,\ndeath taxes, pre-residuary gifts, and certain other charges.  On Decedent\u2019s death,\nRevocable Trust ceased to be revocable. Daughter and an independent trustee are the\ntwo trustees of this trust.\nOn Date 2, Decedent executed a will.  Article II of Decedent\u2019s will provides that\nDecedent\u2019s tangible personal property is to be distributed in accordance with any\nmemoranda signed and dated by Decedent which disposes of any of Decedent\u2019s\ntangible personal property.  Except as otherwise devised, Decedent gives and devises\n4\nPLR-114698-02\nhis tangible personal property, along with any insurance policies relating thereto, to\nDaughter, if she survives Decedent.  Article III of Decedent\u2019s will provides that\nDecedent\u2019s residuary estate is to be distributed to the then serving trustees of the\nRevocable Trust.  \nArticle V, section B of Decedent\u2019s will provides that any estate, legacy,\nsuccession, inheritance, transfer, excise (including any excise tax imposed under\nsection 4980A) and other similar taxes (including any generation-skipping transfer tax)\nimposed by reason of Decedent\u2019s death, together with any interest and penalties\nthereon, referred to therein as \u201cdeath taxes,\u201d are to be paid as follows: (1) All death\ntaxes, other than any generation-skipping transfer tax imposed upon or with respect to\nproperty which passes (i) under the will, or (ii) to or under the Revocable Trust is to be\npaid out of Decedent\u2019s general estate as an administration expense, without proration\nor apportionment against any recipient thereof and without any statutory rights to\nrecover any amounts so paid.  (2) All other death taxes are to be prorated and\napportioned in the manner provided by law.  Article V, section C of Decedent\u2019s will\nprovides that his funeral, medical, and administration expenses are to be paid out of his\ngeneral estate.  Article V, section D of the will provides that Decedent\u2019s \u201cresiduary\nestate\u201d is to consist of all of Decedent\u2019s property wherever located (except any property\nover which Decedent had a power of appointment, it being Decedent\u2019s intention not to\nexercise any such power by the disposition of the residuary estate), remaining after\npayment of all debts, funeral and administration expenses and death taxes as provided\nin this article, any pre-residuary gifts and any other charges payable out of the principal\nof Decedent\u2019s general estate.  Article V, section E of the will provides that if the assets\nof Decedent\u2019s general estate (exclusive of residential real property and tangible\npersonal property) are insufficient or too illiquid to pay decedent\u2019s funeral and\nadministration expenses or any death taxes required by this article to be paid out of\nDecedent\u2019s general estate as an administration expense, Decedent\u2019s personal\nrepresentative is to make a written request to the trustees of the Revocable Trust to\ndistribute to Decedent\u2019s personal representative, or pay directly from the principal of\nthat trust, such amount as may be necessary to pay such expenses and death taxes.\nArticle II of the Revocable Trust, as amended, provides for the administration of\nthe trust upon Decedent\u2019s death, with the trust then termed the Terminating Trust. \nArticle II, section B of the Revocable Trust provides that if the Terminating Trust\ncontains any stock of Company, then such stock is to be disposed of as follows: (1) the\ntrustees are to distribute the Company voting preferred stock as follows: (a) if Son\nsurvives Decedent, then the voting preferred stock is to be held by trustees in a\nseparate trust pursuant to Article III of the agreement;  (2) the trustees are to distribute\nthe Company nonvoting preferred stock pursuant to Article IV of the agreement.  Article\nII, section C provides that the balance of the Terminating Trust remaining after the\ndistributions directed under the preceding sections of Article II, referred to in the\nagreement as Decedent\u2019s \u201cresiduary estate,\u201d is to be disposed of pursuant to Article V\nof the agreement.\n5\nPLR-114698-02\nArticle III of the Revocable Trust provides for the establishment of a separate\ntrust for the benefit of Son, Son\u2019s descendants, and Son\u2019s wife.  Upon the death of the\nlast to die of Son and Son\u2019s wife, the trustees are to distribute the principal of this trust,\ntogether with all accrued or collected but undistributed income, to Daughter, if she is\nthen living.  If Daughter is not then living, then the trust assets are to be distributed\npursuant to a special power of appointment exercised by Daughter.\nArticle IV of the Revocable Trust provides for the establishment of a separate\ntrust to be funded with a fractional share of the property allocated to Article IV, the\nnumerator of which equals Decedent\u2019s unused GST exemption [see section 2631,\ndealing with a generation-skipping transfer tax exemption], and the denominator of\nwhich equals the value of the property allocated to this article as finally determined for\nfederal estate tax purposes.  The trustees may pay or apply all or any part of the net\nincome and principal thereof to or for the benefit of Daughter and Daughter\u2019s\ndescendants in such proportions as the trustees in their discretion consider advisable\nfor any eligible beneficiary\u2019s maintenance in health and reasonable comfort, education,\nor support in such eligible beneficiary\u2019s accustomed manner of living.  If Daughter\nsurvives Decedent, then upon Daughter\u2019s death the trustees are to distribute the\nremaining trust assets pursuant to a special power of appointment exercised by\nDaughter.\nArticle V of the Revocable Trust provides for the disposition of Decedent\u2019s\nresiduary estate.  Section A of this article provides that the trustees are to pay\nDecedent\u2019s debts, death taxes, and expenses as provided by Article VI.  Section B of\nArticle V provides for the distribution of the balance of Decedent\u2019s residuary estate as\nfollows: (1) if Daughter or any of her descendants survive Decedent, an equal share is\nto be disposed of pursuant to Article IV; and (2) one equal share is to be distributed to\nSon, if Son survives Decedent, or if he does not survive Decedent, to Son\u2019s\ndescendants who survive Decedent, per stirpes. \nArticle VI, section A of Revocable Trust provides that upon Decedent\u2019s death,\nthe trustees are to pay to or on behalf of Decedent\u2019s executor out of the principal of the\nresiduary estate, such amounts as the personal representative requests in writing for\nDecedent\u2019s funeral expenses, the expenses of administering Decedent\u2019s estate, and\nany estate, legacy, succession, inheritance, transfer, excise (including any excise tax\nimposed under section 4980A) and other similar taxes (including any generation-\nskipping transfer tax) imposed by reason of Decedent\u2019s death, together with any\ninterest and penalties thereon, referred to in this article as \u201cdeath taxes,\u201d that are\nrequired by Decedent\u2019s will to be paid out of Decedent\u2019s general estate as an\nadministration expense. \nArticle VI, section D of Revocable Trust provides that to the extent that\nDecedent\u2019s residuary estate is not sufficient to pay all of the expenses and death taxes\nas provided in Article VI, sections A and B, then the amount of such expenses and\n6\nPLR-114698-02\ndeath taxes described in Article VI, sections A and B, which are not paid from\nDecedent\u2019s residuary estate (\u201cexcess costs\u201d) are to be paid as follows: (1) the property\npassing under Articles III and IV of this agreement is to bear a proportionate share of\nthe excess costs.  The proportionate share of the excess costs payable from the\nproperty passing under each such article is to equal a fraction of the excess costs, the\nnumerator of which is the fair market value of the property passing under such article as\nfinally determined for federal estate tax purposes, and the denominator of which is the\nfair market value of the property passing under both Articles III and IV as finally\ndetermined for federal estate tax purposes.  (2) The excess costs payable out of the\nproperty passing under Article IV of this agreement is to be paid first from the property\npassing under Article IV, section B, and then, to the extent that the property passing\nunder Article IV, section B is not sufficient to pay all of the excess costs payable out of\nthe property passing under Article IV, from the property passing under Article IV,\nsection A.\nTerminating Trust, which was created under Article II of Revocable Trust,\nbecame the holder of the m shares of voting preferred stock and n share of nonvoting\npreferred stock following the death of Decedent.  \nThe m shares of voting preferred stock and n shares of nonvoting preferred\nstock held by Revocable Trust prior to Decedent\u2019s death (which were included in\nDecedent\u2019s taxable estate) were valued at $e  and $v  ( a total of $ev) on Decedent\u2019s\nForm 706.  On audit of the Form 706, the value of the m shares of voting preferred\nstock was increased From $e to $a. Thus, the total audit value of the Company stock\nincluded in Decedent\u2019s Estate, $a plus $v, was $av.\nThe value of Decedent\u2019s gross estate is $h. The amount allowable as a\ndeduction to Estate under sections 2053 and 2054 is $i. The value of the gross estate\nless the deductions ( h minus i) is $j. The $av value of the Company stock included in\nEstate is p percent of the $j total value of the gross estate less deductions.\nThe federal and State B estate, inheritance, legacy, and succession taxes\nimposed because of Decedent\u2019s death totaled $t. The amount of funeral and\nadministrative expenses totaled $fa. Together the$fa expenses and $t taxes totaled\n$fat.\nIt is now proposed that Company will redeem shares of voting and nonvoting\npreferred stock from Terminating Trust in an amount approximately equally to $fat.\n In connection with the proposed transaction, the following representation have\nbeen made:\n(a) \nThe amount to be paid in redemption of the Company stock will not\nexceed the sum of the federal and State B death taxes (including interest\n7\nPLR-114698-02\ncollected as part of such taxes) imposed because of Decedent\u2019s death\nplus the amount of funeral and administration expenses allowed as\ndeductions to Estate under section 2053. All death taxes and funeral and\nadministrative expense  expenses were paid by the trustees of\nTerminating Trust under Article II of the Revocable Trust.\n(b) \nThe total of (i) the funeral and administrative expense allowable as section\n2053 deductions plus (ii) the federal and State B death taxes imposed as\na result of Decedent\u2019s death is $fat.\n(c)\nThe fair market value of Company\u2019s stock included in Decedent\u2019s gross\nestate for federal estate tax purposes exceeds 35 percent of the gross\nestate over the amounts allowable as deductions under sections 2053 and\n2054.\n(d) \nThe interest of Terminating Trust in Company will be directly reduced by\nthe redemption used to pay the funeral expenses, administration\nexpenses, and death taxes.\n(e) \nIn the proposed redemption, Terminating Trust will receive cash which will\nbe approximately equal to the fair market value of the stock in Company\nsurrendered in exchange therefor.\n(f)\nCompany and Terminating Trust will each pay their own expenses\nincurred in the transaction.\n(g) \nNo shareholder of Company is, or will be, obligated to purchase any of the\nCompany stock that will be redeemed.      \n(h) \nTerminating Trust will not transfer any property to Company other than\nstock in Company.   \n(i) \nThe proposed redemption will be the first redemption of any stock\nincluded in Estate.\n(j)\nThere is no plan to issue additional stock in Company and there are no\noutstanding warrants or options to purchases stock in Company, nor are\nthere any outstanding debentures or obligations that are convertible into\nstock in Company.  There is no plan or intention to issue any options,\nwarrants, debentures, or other obligations that may be convertible into\nCompany stock, or which would be considered to be Company stock.\n(k) \nThere are no declared but unpaid dividends, or funds set apart for\ndividends, on any Company stock.  \n8\nPLR-114698-02\n \n(l) \nThe redemption will be completed prior to Date 5, so that it will occur in\nthe period subsequent to Decedent\u2019s death that is specified in section\n303(b)(1).\nSection 2057(a) provides, generally, that for purposes of the tax imposed by \nsection 2001, in the case of an estate of a decedent to which this section applies, the\nvalue of the taxable estate shall be determined by deducting from the value of the gross\nestate the adjusted value of the qualified family-owned business interests (QFOBI) of\nthe decedent.  Section 2057(a)(2) provides that the deduction allowed by this section\nshall not exceed $675,000.\nSection 2057(f)(1) provides, generally, that there is imposed an additional estate\ntax if, within 10 years after the date of the decedent\u2019s death and before the date of the\nqualified heir\u2019s death: (A) the material participation requirements described in \nsection 2032A(c)(6)(B) are not met with respect to the QFOBI which was acquired (or\npassed) from the decedent; (B) the qualified heir disposes of any portion of a QFOBI\n(other than by a disposition to a member of the qualified heir\u2019s family or through a\nqualified conservation contribution under section 170(h)); (C) the qualified heir loses\nUnited States citizenship (within the meaning of section 877) or with respect to whom\nan event described in section 877(e)(1)(A) or (B) occurs, and such heir does not comply\nwith the requirements of section 2057(g); or (D) the principal place of business of a\ntrade or business of the QFOBI ceases to be located in the United States. \nSection 2057(i)(3)(O) provides that for purposes of section 2057, rules similar to\nthe rules in section 6166(g)(1)(B), (C), and (D) (relating to acceleration of payment)\nshall apply.\nSection 6166(g)(1)(A) provides that if: (i) any portion of an interest in a closely\nheld business which qualifies under section 6166(a)(1) is distributed, sold, exchanged,\nor otherwise disposed of, or money and other property attributable to such an interest is\nwithdrawn from such trade or business, and (ii) the aggregate of such distributions,\nsales, exchanges, or other dispositions and withdrawals equals or exceeds 50 percent\nof the value of such interest, then the extension of time for payment of tax provided in\nsection 6166(a) shall cease to apply, and the unpaid portion of the tax payable in\ninstallments shall be paid upon notice and demand from the Secretary.\nSection 6166(g)(1)(B) provides that in the case of a distribution in redemption of\nstock to which section 303 (or so much of section 304 as relates to section 303)\napplies: (i) the redemption of such stock, and the withdrawal of money and other\nproperty distributed in such redemption, shall not be treated as a distribution or\nwithdrawal for purposes of section 6166(g)(1)(A), and (ii) for purposes of section\n6166(g)(1)(A), the value of the interest in the closely held business shall be considered\nto be such value reduced by the value of the stock redeemed.  This paragraph shall\n9\nPLR-114698-02\napply only if, on or before the date prescribed by section 6166(a)(3) for the payment of\nthe first installment which becomes due after the date of the distribution (or, if earlier, on\nor before the day which is 1 year after the date of the distribution), there is paid an\namount of the tax imposed by section 2001 not less than the amount of money and\nother property distributed.\nSection 2057(i)(1) provides that the term \u201cqualified heir\u201d has the meaning given\nto such term by section 2032A(e)(1), and includes any active employee of the trade or\nbusiness to which the qualified family-owned business interest relates if such employee\nhas been employed by such trade or business for a period of at least 10 years before\nthe date of the decedent\u2019s death.\nSection 2032A(e)(1) provides that the term \u201cqualified heir\u201d means, with respect to\nany property, a member of the decedent\u2019s family who acquired such property (or to\nwhom such property passed) from the decedent.  If a qualified heir disposes of any\ninterest in qualified real property to any member of his family, such member shall\nthereafter be treated as the qualified heir with respect to such interest.\nSection 2057(i)(2) provides that the term \u201cmember of the family\u201d has the\nmeaning given to such term by section 2032A(e)(2).\nSection 2032A(e)(2) provides that the term \u201cmember of the family\u201d means, with\nrespect to any individual, only: (A) an ancestor of such individual, (B) the spouse of\nsuch individual, (C) a lineal descendant of such individual, of such individual\u2019s spouse,\nor of a parent of such individual, or (D) the spouse of any lineal descendant described\nin section 2032A(e)(2)(C).  For purposes of the preceding sentence, a legally adopted\nchild of an individual shall be treated as the child of such individual by blood. \nSection 2057(i)(3)(O) provides that rules similar to the rule in section\n6166(g)(1)(B) (relating to acceleration of payment) shall apply for purposes of section\n2057.  Section 6166(g)(1)(B) provides that in the case of a distribution in redemption of\nstock to which section 303 (or so much of section 304 as relates to section 303)\napplies, the redemption of such stock, and the withdrawal of money and other property\ndistributed in such redemption shall not be treated as a distribution or withdrawal for\npurposes of determining whether the extension of time for payment of tax shall cease to\napply. \nBased solely on the information submitted and the representations set forth\nabove, we hold as follows:\n(1)\nThe proposed distribution of cash by Company in redemption of a portion\nof the Company stock held by Terminating Trust, as described above,\nconstitutes a distribution in full payment in exchange for the Company\nstock redeemed as provided in section 303(a), to the extent that the\n10\nPLR-114698-02\namount received does not exceed the sum specified in section 303(a) and\nprovided that the requirements set forth in section 303(b) are satisfied.\n(2)\nAs provided in section 1001, gain will be recognized by Terminating Trust\nmeasured by the difference between the redemption price and the\nadjusted basis of the stock surrendered as determined under section\n1011.  Provided section 341 (relating to collapsible corporations) is not\napplicable, and the provided also that the stock is a capital asset in the\nhands of Terminating Trust, the gain if any, will constitute capital gain\nsubject to the provisions and limitations of Subchapter P of Chapter 1..   \n(3)\nThe distribution in redemption of stock to which section 303 applies will\nnot be treated as a disposition of any portion of a qualified family-owned\nbusiness interest under section 2057(f)(1)(B).  Provided the proposed\nredemption satisfies the requirements of section 303, the proposed\nredemption will not result in the imposition of an additional estate tax\nunder section 2057(f)(1)(B).\n(4)\nSince the section 303 redemption involves the initial transfer of stock\nbetween the Estate and the qualified heirs as shareholders and is not a\nsale by the qualified heirs to a person other than a member of Decedent\u2019s\nfamily, there has been no disposition under section 2057(f).  However, if\nafter the redemption, the Company reissues the redeemed shares, or\nissues any new shares of stock in Company to a non-family member, a\nrecapture tax will be triggered by the transaction.\nThe above rulings are effective to the extent that the amount distributed by\nCompany equals the fair market value of the stock redeemed.  No opinion is expressed\nas to the tax effect of the amount , if any, by which the distribution by Company\nexceeds or is less than the fair market value of the stock redeemed. A determination of\nthe fair market value of the stock redeemed is reserved until the income tax returns of\nthe taxpayers concerned have been filed for the year the transaction is consummated. \n.\nIn addition, no opinion is expressed about the tax treatment of the transaction\nunder other provisions of the Code and regulations or about the tax treatment of any\nconditions existing at the time of, or effect resulting from, the transaction that are not\nspecifically covered by the above rulings.\nThis ruling is directed only to the taxpayer who requested it. Section 6110(k)(3)\nof the Code provides that it may not be used or cited as precedent.\nA copy of this letter should be attached to the federal income tax returns of the\ntaxpayer involved for the taxable year in which the transaction covered by this ruling\nletter is consummated.\n11\nPLR-114698-02\nPursuant to a power of attorney on file in this office a copy of this letter is being\nsent to your authorized representative.\nSincerely yours.\n         By_____________________   \n Mark S.

Issuer is a city school district created\nunder State law and a political subdivision of State for purposes of \u00a7 103, and is\n2\nauthorized by State law to issue bonds.\nThe Project is a district-wide construction program undertaken by Issuer, with State\nfinancial assistance, to bring its public school facilities into compliance with State\nstandards.  The Project is one of a number of projects in State to modernize public\nschool facilities, all of which will have State-financed assistance.  Nearly every school\nbuilding which Issuer has is in need of full modernization or replacement.  As an\nextensive undertaking in terms of construction resources, students effected, and\nmanagement issues, the Project will require a time period that exceeds the average\npublic works project.\nIssuer estimates that the Project will take approximately 10 years to complete and will\ncost approximately $a, approximately $b (53 percent) of which will be provided by State. \nA resolution approving the issuance of the proposed Bonds was passed by Issuer on\nDate 1.  The proceeds of the Bonds will be used to pay for a portion of the costs of the\nProject that are to be funded by Issuer.\nIssuer and Commission, acting on behalf of State, have approved a plan (the \u201cMaster\nPlan\u201d) for the Project as required by State law in order to receive financial assistance\nfrom State.  The Master Plan divides the Project into four separate segments.  Under\nState law, State funding must be paid in installments for each of the four segments of\nthe Project.  Before State will authorize funding for its share of the cost of a Project\nsegment, Issuer must have available funds in an amount sufficient to pay for its share\nof the cost for that segment.  State law requires that State\u2019s financial assistance (the\n\u201cState match\u201d) must be spent on those qualified Project costs described in the Master\nPlan on a pro rata basis with the Issuer\u2019s contribution for such costs.  Issuer represents\nthat all funds constituting the State match, along with all proceeds of the Bonds, will be\nused by Issuer to complete the Project.\nIssuer has determined that it should issue the Bonds as early as possible.  Funding for\nthe State match is a priority under State law.  Nevertheless, the status of funding for the\nState match in future years is very uncertain.  In the event that State fails to meet its\nmatching fund obligations for school districts in State, State law provides that a school\ndistrict that has already qualified to receive the State match for its co-funded projects is\nto be given priority for State funds over other school districts.\nFor all purposes of \u00a7 148, Issuer represents that it will allocate funds from different\nsources for the same governmental purpose to expenditures using the \u201cgross proceeds\nspent first\u201d allocation method permitted under \u00a7 1.148-6(d)(1)(i) of the Income Tax\nRegulations.  All proceeds of the Bonds will thus be allocated to Project expenditures\nprior to allocating any other funds to Project expenditures, including the payments\nreceived from the State for the State match.  Using this allocation method to allocate\nBond proceeds to Project expenditures, Issuer reasonably expects to allocate more\nthan 85 percent of the spendable proceeds of the Bonds to Project expenditures within\nthree years from the issue date of the Bonds.\n3\nIssuer represents that not more than 50 percent of the proceeds of the Bonds will be\ninvested in nonpurpose investments having a substantially guaranteed yield for four\nyears or more.\nIssuer also represents that the weighted average maturity of the Bonds will not exceed\n120 percent of the reasonably expected economic life of that portion of the Project to be\nfinanced with the proceeds of the Bonds (determined in the same manner as under\n\u00a7 147(b)).\nLaw and Analysis\nSection 149(g)(1) provides that \u00a7 103(a) shall not apply to any hedge bond unless, with\nrespect to the issue of which such bond is a part, the requirements of \u00a7\u00a7 149(g)(2) and\n149(f)(3) are met.\nSection 149(g)(3) defines a hedge bond generally as any bond issued as part of an\nissue unless (i) the issuer reasonably expects that 85 percent of the spendable\nproceeds of the issue will be used to carry out the governmental purposes of the issue\nwithin the 3-year period beginning on the date the bonds are issued, and (ii) not more\nthan 50 percent of the proceeds of the issue are invested in nonpurpose investments\n(as defined in \u00a7 148(f)(6)(A)) having a substantially guaranteed yield for 4 years or\nmore.\nSection 1.149(g)-1(a) provides that, except as otherwise provided, the definitions set\nforth in \u00a7 1.148-1 apply for purposes of \u00a7 149(g) and [\u00a7 1.149(g)-1].\nSection 1.149(g)-1(b) provides that \u00a7 1.148-6 applies for purposes of \u00a7 149(g), except\nthat an expenditure that results in the creation of replacement proceeds (other than\namounts in a bona fide debt service fund or a reasonably required reserve or\nreplacement fund) is not an expenditure for purposes of \u00a7 149(g).\nSection 1.148-1(c)(1) provides in part  that amounts are replacement proceeds of an\nissue if they have a sufficiently direct nexus to the issue or to the governmental purpose\nof the issue to conclude that the amounts would have been used for that governmental\npurpose if the proceeds of the issue were not used or to be used for that governmental\npurpose.\nSection 1.148-1(c)(4(i)(A) provides in part that replacement proceeds arise to the extent\nthat the issuer reasonably expects as of the issue date that the term of an issue will be\nlonger than is reasonably necessary for the governmental purposes of the issue.\nSection 1.148-1(c)(4)(i)(B)(2) provides that as a safe harbor, replacement proceeds do\nnot arise under paragraph (c)(4)(i)(A) of [\u00a7 1.148-1], for the portion of an issue\n(including a refunding issue) that is to be used to finance or refinance capital projects, if\nthat portion has a weighted average maturity that does not exceed 120 percent of the\naverage reasonably expected economic life of the financed capital projects, determined\n4\nin the same manner as under \u00a7 147(b).\nSection 1.148-6(a)(1) provides that an issuer may use any reasonable, consistently\napplied accounting method to account for gross proceeds, investments, and\nexpenditures of an issue.\nSection 1.148-6(a)(2) provides that an accounting method does not fail to be\nreasonable and consistently applied solely because a different accounting method is\nused for a bona fide governmental purpose to consistently account for a particular item. \nBona fide governmental purposes may include special state law restrictions imposed on\nspecific funds or actions to avoid grant forfeitures.\nSection 1.148-6(d)(1)(i) provides that reasonable accounting methods for allocating\nfunds from different sources to expenditures for the same governmental purpose\ninclude any of the following methods if consistently applied: a specific tracing method; a\ngross proceeds spent first method; a first-in, first-out method; or a ratable allocation\nmethod.\nIssuer has represented that (i) it reasonably expects to use the gross proceeds spent\nfirst allocation method to allocate more than 85 percent of the spendable proceeds of\nthe Bonds to Project expenditures within three years from the issue date of the Bonds,\nand (ii) not more than 50 percent of the proceeds of the Bonds will be invested in\nnonpurpose investments having a substantially guaranteed yield for four years or more. \nThe Bonds will thus not be hedge bonds under \u00a7 149(g)(3), provided that replacement\nproceeds are not created by these expenditures of Bond proceeds.  See \u00a7 1.149(g)-\n1(b).\nIn this case, the only other funds with a nexus to the Project are the funds provided by\nthe State match.  However, all funds constituting the State match, along with all\nproceeds of the Bonds, will be used by Issuer to complete the Project.  The Bond\nproceeds will not be spent on Project costs in lieu of spending the State match, but\nrather in addition to spending the State match.  Because all funds constituting the State\nmatch will be used for the governmental purpose, those funds are not replacement\nproceeds of the Bonds within the meaning of \u00a7 1.148-1(c)(1).  This result is not\nchanged because the State match must be spent on qualified Project costs on a pro\nrata basis with Issuer\u2019s payments.\nIssuer has adopted the gross proceeds spent first accounting method for purposes of\nallocating Bond proceeds to Project expenditures, as allowed under \u00a7 1.148-6(d)(i). \nPursuant to \u00a7 1.148-6(a)(1), Issuer represents that it will consistently apply this\naccounting method.  An accounting method does not fail to be reasonable and\nconsistently applied solely because a different accounting method is used for a bona\nfide governmental purpose to consistently account for a particular item.  Under \u00a7 1.148-\n6(a)(2), bona fide governmental purposes may include restrictions imposed on specific\nfunds, such as the State law requiring pro rata expenditures of the State match.\n5\nConclusion\nUnder the facts and circumstances of this case, we conclude that the Bonds will not be\nhedge bonds under \u00a7149(g)(3).\nThe ruling contained in this letter is based upon information and representations\nsubmitted by the taxpayer and accompanied by a penalty of perjury statement executed\nby an appropriate party.

Decedent\u2019s Estate\nincluded non-probate assets consisting of a tax-deferred annuity account (TDA), the\nbeneficiaries of which are A, B, and C, and an individual retirement account (IRA), the\nbeneficiary of which is D.  A, B, C, and D are all non-resident aliens (NRAs) who are\ncitizens of Country.\nDecedent\u2019s will provides that \u201call transfer, estate, or inheritance taxes in\nconnection with my estate shall be apportioned among the beneficiaries.\u201d  The\nexecutors of Estate were concerned that they would not be able to recover any portion\nof the federal and state estate taxes that was to be apportioned among the NRA\nbeneficiaries of the TDA and IRA accounts, A, B, C, and D, which the executors of\nEstate calculated as x% of the respective values of the accounts.\nTherefore, Estate petitioned Court to order the custodians of the TDA and IRA to\nset aside x% of the account values, and direct payments of such amounts to Estate for\nthe purpose of paying estate taxes.  Court granted these petitions.\nThe custodians of the TDA and IRA paid over to Estate x% of the account\nvalues, which Estate used to pay federal and state estate taxes.  The amount\ndistributed from the TDA was $y;  the amount distributed from the IRA was $z.  The\ncustodians issued Forms 1099-R, Distributions From Pensions, Annuities, Retirement\nor Profit-Sharing Plans, IRAs, Insurance Contracts, etc., to Estate.\nEstate requests a ruling that the distributions paid to Estate reported on the\nForms 1099-R are not income to the estate, but to the NRA beneficiaries of the\naccounts.  However, if the distributions paid to Estate are income to Estate, Estate\nrequests rulings that the estate tax payments made by Estate will be treated as\ndistributions to A, B, C, and D under \u00a7 661 and that such distributions are not subject to\nUnited States income tax or withholding because of the provisions of Treaty.\nRULING 1\nSection 691(a)(1) provides that the amount of all items of gross income in\nrespect of a decedent which are not properly includable in respect of the taxable period\nin which falls the date of the decedent\u2019s death or a prior period (including the amount of\nall items of gross income in respect of a prior decedent, if the right to receive such\namount was acquired by reason of the death of the prior decedent or by bequest,\ndevise, or inheritance from the prior decedent) shall be included in the gross income,\nfor the taxable year when received, of: (A) the estate of the decedent, if the right to\nreceive the amount is acquired by the decedent\u2019s estate from the decedent; (B) the\nperson who, by reason of the death of the decedent, acquires the right to receive the\namount, if the right to receive the amount is not acquired by the decedent\u2019s estate from\nthe decedent; or (C) the person who acquires from the decedent the right to receive the\n3\nPLR-135440-01\namount by bequest, devise, or inheritance, if the amount is received after a distribution\nby the decedent\u2019s estate of such right.\nSection 1.691(a)-1(b) of the Income Tax Regulations provides that the term\n\u201cincome in respect of a decedent\u201d refers to those amounts to which a decedent was\nentitled as gross income, but which were not properly includable in computing the\ndecedent\u2019s taxable income for the taxable year ending with the date of the decedent\u2019s\ndeath or for a previous taxable year under the method of accounting employed by the\ndecedent.\nRev. Rul. 92-47, 1992-1 C.B. 198, holds that a distribution to the beneficiary of a\ndecedent\u2019s IRA that equals the amount of the balance in the IRA at the decedent\u2019s\ndeath, less any nondeductible contributions, is income in respect of a decedent under \n\u00a7 691(a)(1) that is includable in the gross income of the beneficiary for the tax year the\ndistribution is received. \nSection 691(a)(3) provides that the right to receive an  amount of income in\nrespect of a decedent shall be treated, in the hands of the estate of the decedent or any\nperson who acquired such right by reason of the death of the decedent, or by bequest,\ndevise, or inheritance from the decedent, as if it had been acquired by the estate or\nsuch person in the transaction in which the right to receive the income was originally\nderived and the amount includable in gross income shall be considered, in the hands of\nthe estate or such person to have the character which it would have had in the hands of\nthe decedent if the decedent had lived and received such income.\nSection 661(a) provides that in any taxable year there shall be allowed as a\ndeduction in computing the taxable income of an estate or trust (other than a trust to\nwhich subpart B applies), the sum of (1) any amount of income for such taxable year\nrequired to be distributed currently (including any amount required to be distributed\nwhich may be paid out of income or corpus to the extent such amount is paid out of\nincome for such taxable year); and (2) any other amounts properly paid or credited or\nrequired to be distributed for such taxable year; but such deduction shall not exceed the\ndistributable net income (DNI) of the estate or trust.\nSection 1.661(a)-2(d) provides that the terms \u201cincome required to be distributed\ncurrently\u201d and \u201cany other amounts properly paid or credited or required to be\ndistributed\u201d also include any amount used to discharge or satisfy any person\u2019s legal\nobligation as that term is used in \u00a7 1.662(a)-4.\nBased solely on the facts and representations submitted, we conclude that the\ndistributions from the TDA and IRA to the Estate made pursuant to the order of the\nCourt are IRD to the Estate and will be included in the DNI of the Estate.  Furthermore,\nthe payments of Estate\u2019s federal estate taxes by Estate that A, B, C, and D are\nobligated to pay will be treated as distributions of DNI to A, B, C, and D, to the extent\nthe payments are made from the IRD amounts.\n4\nPLR-135440-01\nRULING 2\nIn general, where a nonresident alien who is not engaged in a United States\ntrade or business receives certain income from the United States, 30 percent U.S.\nincome tax withholding is levied on the gross amount received under \u00a7 871(a)(1). \nIncome subject to withholding includes \u201cinterest, dividends, rents, salaries, wages,\nemoluments, and other fixed or determinable annual or periodical gains, profits and\nincome\u201d (\u201cFDAP\u201d).  Section 871(a)(1)(A).  A single lump-sum payment may be\nconsidered FDAP and is subject to withholding.  Section 1.1441-2(b)(1)(ii).  \u201cOther fixed\nor determinable annual or periodical gains, profits and income\u201d is defined in relevant\npart as all income included in gross income under \u00a7 61, with the exception of certain\nitems specified in the regulations and items of income that are excluded from income\nwithout regard to the U.S. or foreign status of the owner of the income. 1.1441-\n2(b)(1)(i).\nUnder domestic law, the payments made by the custodians of the TDA and IRA\naccounts would be subject to 30% withholding under \u00a7\u00a7 871(a) and 1441.  However,\nthe provisions of the Code \u201cshall be applied to any taxpayer with due regard to any\ntreaty obligation of the United States which applies to such taxpayer\u201d. Section\n894(a)(1).  Under \u00a7 1.1441-6, the 30% tax may be reduced or eliminated to the extent\nprovided under an income tax treaty in effect between the United States and a foreign\ncountry.\nIn this case, the potentially applicable treaty is Treaty, because the TDA and IRA\nbeneficiaries are citizens and residents of Country.  Article 20 (Private Pensions and\nAnnuities) of the Treaty provides in relevant part as follows:\n(1) Except as provided in Article 22 (Government Functions),\npensions and other similar remuneration paid to an individual\nshall be taxable only in the Contracting State of which he is a\nresident.\n(2) Alimony and annuities paid to an individual who is a\nresident of one of the Contracting States shall be taxable only\nin that Contracting State. \n* * * * \n(4) The term \u201cpensions and other similar remuneration\u201d, as\nused in this Article, means periodic payments other than social\nsecurity payments covered in Article 21 (Social Security\nPayments) made (a) by reason of retirement or death and in\nconsideration for services rendered...\n* * * * \n5\nPLR-135440-01\n(5) The term \u201cannuities\u201d, as used in this Article, means a stated\nsum paid periodically at stated times during life, or during a\nspecified number of years, under an obligation to make the\npayments in return for adequate and full consideration (other\nthan services rendered).\nThe Technical Explanation of Treaty prepared by the Department of the Treasury\nparaphrases Treaty:\n \n[P]rivate pensions and similar remuneration derived from\nsources within one Contracting State by an individual\nresident of the other Contracting State are exempt from tax\nin the first-mentioned Contracting State... The term\n\u201cpensions and similar remuneration\u201d is defined in paragraph\n(4) as periodic payments, other than social security\npayments covered in Article 21 (Social Security Payments),\nmade by reason of retirement or death and in consideration\nfor services rendered. \nThe distributions in this case cannot constitute annuities within the meaning of\nparagraph 5 of Article 20, because they are not in return for adequate and full\nconsideration other than services rendered.  They are, in fact, in return for services\nrendered by Decedent. \nIn order to constitute \u201cpensions and other similar remuneration\u201d within the\nmeaning of paragraph 4, the payments must be made by reason of retirement or death\nand \u201cin consideration for services rendered\u201d.  In this case, we conclude that it would be\nappropriate to treat distributions from the TDA and the IRA as pension distributions for\npurposes of the Treaty. \nThe payments in this case are being made in lump sums rather than a series of\nperiodic payments.  However, although the definition of \u201cpensions and other similar\nremuneration\u201d in paragraph 4 refers to \u201cperiodic payments,\u201d the fact that a pension\ndistribution may be in the form of a lump sum will not, by itself, disqualify the distribution\nfor treaty benefits unless the treaty partner interprets the term \u201cperiodic\u201d to exclude\nlump-sum distributions.\n                                                                  \nTherefore, based solely on the facts and representations submitted, we conclude\nthat the distributions from Decedent\u2019s TDA and IRA accounts to the Estate, which are\nthen treated as distributed to beneficiaries A, B, C, and D, who are residents of\nCountry, are not subject to U.S. withholding and are taxable only in Country pursuant to\nArticle 20(1) of Treaty.\n6\nPLR-135440-01\n \nExcept as set forth above, no opinion is expressed or implied as to the federal\nincome tax consequences of the transactions described above under any other\nprovision of the Code. \nThis ruling is directed only to the taxpayer on whose behalf it was requested. \nSection 6110(k)(3) provides that it may not be used or cited as precedent.\nSincerely yours,\n \nJ.

The Statute provides \naccidental disability retirement benefits to eligible participants.  \nTaxpayer has previously received a private letter ruling (PLR) on the tax treatment of \naccidental disability retirement benefits paid under the Plans to participants who incur a \nwork-related injury or sickness.  The PLR concluded that the accidental disability \nretirement benefits are excludable under section 104(a)(1) to the extent the benefits do \nnot exceed a specified percentage of the participant\u2019s average final compensation.  The \nPLR also held that accidental disability retirement benefits paid to a participant\u2019s \nsurvivor are taxable to the same extent as the benefits paid to the participant.  The PLR \ndid not address how former spouses should be taxed with respect to accidental \ndisability retirement benefits received pursuant to a domestic relations order.   \n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n--------------------------------------------------------------  \nState Regulation was recently amended to provide that, pursuant to an eligible domestic \nrelations order, all payments to the alternate payee shall be includable in the taxable \nincome of and taxable to the alternate payee in the same proportion as payments to the \nparticipant are includable in the taxable income of and taxable to the participant.  \nTaxpayer has not implemented this change pending the issuance of this PLR.    \nSection 104(a)(1) of the Code and section 1.104-1(b) of the Income Tax Regulations \nexclude from gross income amounts that are received by an employee under a \nworkmen's compensation act or under a statute in the nature of a workmen's \ncompensation act that provides compensation to employees for personal injuries or\nsickness incurred in the course of employment.  Section 1.104-1(b) of the regulations \nalso provides that the exclusion from income of amounts described in section 104(a)(1)  \napplies to compensation which is paid under a workmen\u2019s compensation act to the \nsurvivor or survivors of a deceased employee.  The exclusion from income of amounts \ndescribed in section 104(a)(1) does not apply to a retirement pension or annuity to the \nextent that it is determined by reference to the employee's age or length of service, or \nPLR-142961-14\n3\nthe employee's prior contributions, even though the employee's retirement is \noccasioned by an occupational injury or sickness. \nSection 104(a)(1) is strictly construed to conform to the general purview of section 61 \nthat all income is taxable unless explicitly excluded.  The accidental disability retirement \nbenefits are specifically paid to State employees for their work-related injury or \nsickness, and not the work-related injury or sickness of the former spouses.  Moreover, \nsection 1.104-1 of the regulations explicitly limits the exclusion from income to \nemployees and their survivors.  Neither the Code nor the regulations provide an \nexclusion from income for amounts paid to former spouses pursuant to a domestic \nrelations order.   See, Fernandez v. Commissioner, 138 T.C. 378 (2012). \nAccordingly, based on the information submitted and representations made, and \nauthorities cited above, we conclude that accidental disability retirement benefits paid \nunder the Plans to former spouses of State employees pursuant to eligible domestic \nrelations orders are not excludable under section 104(a)(1) of the Code from the taxable \nincome of the former spouses.  The entire amount paid to the former spouses is \nincludible in taxable income.    \nThis ruling applies to accidental disability retirement benefits paid to former spouses for \ntax years beginning after December 31, 20---.  \nNo opinion is expressed or implied concerning the federal tax consequences under any \nother provision of the Code or regulations other than those specifically stated above.\nThis ruling is directed only to the Taxpayer who requested it.  Section 6110(k) of the \nCode provides that it may not be used or cited as precedent.\nSincerely,\n/S/\nHarry Beker\nChief, Health & Welfare Branch\nOffice of Associate Chief Counsel\n(Tax Exempt and Government Entities)\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Adverse"}]}

The Borrower is a general partnership\nengaged in real estate development.  The Borrower has entered into a lease agreement\nwith Lessee to construct and lease to Lessee the Facility, which is located in the City. \nThe Lessee intends to use the Facility in its publishing business.  \nThe Borrower intends to obtain financing for the construction and equipping of\nthe Facility by using Bond proceeds.  The Bonds are planned to be issued by the City\u2019s\nindustrial development authority as qualified small issue bonds under \u00a7 141(e)(1)(D). \nThe Issuer will elect to increase the small issue exemption to $10,000,000 under\n\u00a7 144(a)(4).  The Borrower anticipates that the capital expenditure requirements under\n\u00a7 144 would be met.  The improvements to the land on which the Facility will be located\nwould be subject to an allowance for depreciation.\n2\n                         \nThe Lessee is a publisher of business and other directories.  Its primary\ncustomers are businesses that purchase advertising space and listings in the\ndirectories and subscribers to the directories.  The process of publishing Lessee\u2019s\ndirectories can be divided into four phases.  The first phase consists of the sale of\nadvertising to a customer.  The second phase consists of the process of creating the\nadvertisement and designing the directory.  The third phase is the \u201cpost-script\u201d phase. \nThe fourth and final phase is the printing and binding of the directories.  The second\nand third phase occur at the Facility.\nIn the first phase, a Lessee sales representative meets with a potential customer\nto discuss the advertising.  If the customer orders the advertising, the sales\nrepresentative puts together a package and delivers it to the Facility.  This package\ncontains a sketch of the ad, also called the \u201ccopy sheet,\u201d representing the basic\nadvertising idea, any customer instruction and other information to be used in the ad\ncreation and design process, and the contract.  This phase, including the creation of the\n\u201ccopy sheet,\u201d occurs away from the Facility.\nThe activities at the Facility begin with the second phase.  In the second phase,\nthe ad creation and directory design phase, a graphic artist creates the ad utilizing a\ndesktop computer and graphic software.  The graphic artist initially creates a proposed\nadvertisement in accordance with the basic advertising idea in the \u201ccopy sheet.\u201d  The\nproposed ad is then continually proofread and modified at the Facility and relayed to the\ncustomer until the customer gives the final approval for the ad.  Once the ad is\napproved by the customer, the ad, together with surrounding listings, is placed and\narranged on a particular page of the directory and the pages are numbered and\nproofread.  Most of the Facility is used for this phase of the directory publishing\nprocess.\nIn the third phase, the compiled directory pages are put through the \u201cpost-script\u201d\nprocess which entails formatting of the pages from computer language into a\nspecialized machine language.  The final proofs of each page are then created,\nproofread and approved.  Upon final review and approval, the pages are downloaded\nonto a CD-ROM.  A hard copy and the CD-ROM containing the final output copy of\neach page are then shipped to printing companies which are located in the geographic\nareas in which Lessee\u2019s directories are distributed.  This concludes the activities at the\nFacility.\nIn the fourth and final phase, the final output copy is used by the printer to print\nand bind Lessee\u2019s directories.  This phase occurs away from the Facility.\nLAW AND ANALYSIS\nSection 103(a) of the Code provides that gross income does not include interest\non a State or local bond. Section 103(b)(1) provides that section 103(a) does not apply\nto any private activity bond, unless it is a \"qualified bond.\" Section 141(e)(1)(D) provides\nthat a \"qualified small issue bond\" is a \"qualified bond.\"\n3\n                         \nSection 144(a)(1) provides that the term \"qualified small issue bond\" means any\nbond issued as part of an issue the aggregate authorized face amount of which is\n$ 1,000,000 or less and 95 percent or more of the net proceeds of which are to be used\nfor the acquisition, construction, reconstruction, or improvement of land or property of a\ncharacter subject to the allowance for depreciation, or to redeem a prior issue that was\nused for those purposes. Under \u00a7 144(a)(4), the issuer may elect to increase the\n$ 1,000,000 limitation to $ 10,000,000 provided certain other requirements are also\nmet. The proceeds, however, are still required to be used in the manner described in\n\u00a7 144(a)(1).\nSection 144(a)(12)(A) provides, in part, that \u00a7 144(a) does not apply to any bond\nissued after December 31, 1986, unless the bond proceeds are used to provide a\nmanufacturing facility. Section 144(a)(12)(C) states that the term \"manufacturing facility\"\nmeans any facility which is used in the manufacturing or production of tangible personal\nproperty (including the processing resulting in a change in the condition of such\nproperty). The term \"manufacturing facility\" includes facilities which are directly related\nand ancillary to a manufacturing facility (determined without regard to this sentence) if-\n(i) such facilities are located on the same site as the manufacturing facility, and (ii) not\nmore than 25 percent of the net proceeds of the issue are used to provide such\nfacilities.\nThere is no authority interpreting the phrase \"used in the manufacturing or\nproduction of tangible personal property\" as found in \u00a7 144(a)(12)(C).  Moreover, while\nthe term manufacturing is used in various places in the Code, there is no uniform\ngeneralized meaning. Thus, we must look to the statutory language and legislative\nhistory to apply the provision to a given set of facts and circumstances.\nSection 144(a)(12)(C) distinguishes between core manufacturing and activities\nthat are directly related and ancillary to core manufacturing.  All ancillary activities must\noccur at the same site as the manufacturing activity, and the manufacturing activity\nmust constitute substantially all of the on-site economic activity.  H.R. Rep. No. 100-\n795, at 576 (1988).  All other activity must be subordinated and integral to the\nmanufacturing process.  Id.  The statute and legislative history indicate that core\nmanufacturing should be narrowly defined.  See id.  The House Report gives examples\nof activities that may be ancillary, such as an on-site laboratory whose purpose is to test\nthe manufactured product for quality or to experiment with different materials which\nmight by used as raw materials for the product.  Id. at 576-77.   Also, forklifts or similar\nequipment are integral to a manufacturing operation, but trucks or vans to deliver the\nfinal product are not integral to the manufacturing process.  Id. at 577.  Similarly, the\nterm \u201ctangible personal property,\u201d as it is used in \u00a7 144(a)(12)(C), must be interpreted\nwithin the context of core manufacturing.  \nSubstantially all of Lessee\u2019s activities at the Facility involve the processing and\ntransformation of data and intellectual, literary, and artistic ideas. These activities are\nnot core manufacturing.  Therefore, manufacturing does not constitute substantially all\nof the activities at the Facility as required under \u00a7 144(a)(12)(C).\n4\n                         \nCONCLUSION\nAccordingly, the activities of the Lessee at the Facility planned to be financed by\nthe Bond proceeds fail to qualify the Facility as a \u201cmanufacturing facility\u201d under\n\u00a7 144(a)(12)(C).\nExcept as expressly provided herein, no opinion is expressed or implied\nconcerning the tax consequences of any aspect of any transaction or item discussed or\nreferenced in this letter.\nThis ruling is directed only to the taxpayer requesting it.  Section 6110(k)(3) of\nthe Code provides that it may not be used or cited as precedent.\nIn accordance with the Power of Attorney on file with this office, a copy of this\nletter is being sent to your authorized representative.\nThe rulings contained in this letter are based upon information and\nrepresentations submitted by the taxpayer and accompanied by a penalty of perjury \nstatement executed by an appropriate party.

See \u00a7 1.170A-13(c)(7)(xi)(A)(2). \n \nOur ruling is also contingent on Taxpayer printing out and saving current and historical \nmarket quotations for Company common stock as described below in the Facts section. \n \nOur ruling is also contingent on current and historical market quotations (including \nquotes (open, high, low, and close) and volume of trading) being as easily accessible \nwithout cost on Internet site B as it is described below in the Facts section on the date \nof the contribution. \n \nFACTS \n \nTaxpayer is a financial holding company.  Its principal activity is to provide a wide range \nof financial products and services to its customers. \n \nTo improve the quality of life for residents in the communities that Taxpayer serves, \nFoundation was established as a State non-profit organization.  Foundation will provide \nfinancial assistance to charitable programs and agencies working within the \ncommunities that Taxpayer serves.  Foundation is organized and operates as a \n\u00a7 501(c)(3) organization and is a private foundation under \u00a7 509(a) of the Code but is \nnot described in \u00a7 170(b)(1)(E).  Foundation qualifies under \u00a7170(c)(2) to receive gifts \nor contributions that are deductible for federal income tax purposes. \n \nTaxpayer would like to contribute both cash and shares of common stock of Company, \na corporation, to Foundation.  Company is a financial services organization that is \ntraded on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board (\u201cOTCBB\u201d) with the stock symbol A.  As \nof Date A, Taxpayer owned X shares of common stock of Company, which represents \nY% of the shares of common stock of Company.  Taxpayer purchased the shares of \ncommon stock of Company more than one year prior to the date of this letter. \n \nCompany has approximately U shareholders.  According to Taxpayer, other than the \nnumber of shareholders, Company would likely meet the threshold requirements for \nlisting on NASDAQ (National Market or SmallCap Market). \n \nPLR-149190-04 \n \n \n3 \n \nCompany common stock is not subject to any legal or Securities and Exchange \nCommission (\u201cSEC\u201d) restrictions on transferability.  Company common stock is currently \ncarried by Z sponsoring investment firms (i.e., Market Makers).  In Date X, V shares of \nCompany common stock were traded on the OTCBB.  As of the end of Date B, W \nshares of Company common stock had been traded in the first seven months of Date Y. \n \nAccording to Taxpayer, Company common stock is not a speculatively traded, volatile \nissue.  Investors in Company hold the stock for its stability of value and dividend \nincome. \n \nCompany\u2019s financial condition is closely monitored through independent external audit, \nas well as by banking regulations and audit by Entity. \n \nThe shares of Company common stock that Taxpayer will contribute to Foundation are \nfreely tradable and not subject to any restriction on transfer imposed by the government \nor by any private party.  The shares are not subject to any such restriction both in the \nhands of Taxpayer and in the hands of Foundation. \n \nThe Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board: \n \nThe OTCBB was established in June 1990 by the SEC to comply with the Penny Stock \nReform Act of 1990, which mandated that the SEC establish an electronic system that \nmet the requirements of section 17B of the Securities Exchange Act, in order to facilitate \nthe widespread publication of quotation and last trade information.  Since December \n1993, investment firms listing shares on the OTCBB are required to report trades in all \ndomestic over-the-counter equity securities through the Automated Confirmation \nTransaction Service (\u201cACT\u201d) within 90 seconds of the transaction. \n \nAccording to Taxpayer, in general, an over-the-counter equity security is any equity that \nis not listed or traded on NASDAQ or national security exchanges such as the New York \nStock Exchange (NYSE) or the American Stock Exchange.  Taxpayer represents that \nbased on general industry terminology, Company common stock is an over-the-counter \nequity security. \n \nOTCBB securities are traded by Market Makers that enter quotes and execute trades \nthrough a closed computer network, which is accessed through a NASDAQ workstation.  \nSecurities traded on the OTCBB include national, regional, and foreign equity issues, \nwarrants, units, American Depository Receipts, and Direct Participation Programs. \n \nThe OTCBB operates as a dealer system.  As a result, all securities quoted on the \nOTCBB must be sponsored by a participating Market Maker that registers that security \nwith the NASD OTC Compliance Unit along with the required issuer information.  Once \napproved by the Compliance Unit, the Market Maker will be notified that it has been \n \nPLR-149190-04 \n \n \n4 \nregistered in the security and may enter a quote and commence trading.  Issuers \ncontact an authorized OTCBB Market Maker for sponsorship of a security on the \nOTCBB. \n \nThe OTCBB now has many safeguards and is subject to regulations that were not \npresent when it was created in 1990.  The OTCBB Eligibility Rule phase-in began on \nJuly 1, 1999 and was completed in June 2000.  The Eligibility Rule requires OTCBB \ncompanies to be registered with and to disclose their current financial information to the \nSEC, banking, or insurance regulators in order to be eligible to be traded on the \nOTCBB.  The objective of the Eligibility Rule is to protect investors by ensuring that they \nhave access to over-the-counter companies\u2019 current financial information when \nconsidering over-the-counter investments.  During the latter half of 1999 and the first \nhalf of 2000, every company whose securities were quoted on the OTCBB was \nreviewed for compliance with the filing requirements for publicly disseminated financial \nstatements.  As a result, in excess of 3,000 companies (over half of OTCBB issues) \nwere delisted and removed from the OTCBB. \n \nNASDAQ is in charge of monitoring the filing status of all OTCBB issuers.  In the event \nof a filing delinquency, NASDAQ will disclose that the financial statements on file are \nnot current.  After 30 days, if NASDAQ has not been notified that the appropriate filing \nhas been made with the issuer\u2019s regulatory authority, the issuer\u2019s security will be \nremoved from the OTCBB. \n \nThe Market Maker that sponsors a security on the system files the application and is \nobligated to comply with the regulatory requirements.  Also, the quotation activity and \ntrade practices of OTCBB Market Makers are further regulated by the National \nAssociation of Securities Dealers (\u201cNASD\u201d).  Also, the broker/dealer firms and \nstockbrokers that trade OTCBB securities (i.e., Market Makers) are subject to SEC \ntrading rules, such as SEC Rule 15g-9 regarding sales practices for low-priced \nsecurities. \n \nOTCBB issuers are subject to many of the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of \n2002.  OTCBB issuers that are not in compliance with the requirements of Sarbanes-\nOxley subject their securities to removal from the OTCBB. \n \nThe OTCBB has recently partnered with Standard & Poor\u2019s to offer an investor relations \nservice.  Standard & Poor\u2019s Company Insights is designed to increase an OTCBB \ncompany\u2019s visibility and disclosure of information to investors, analysts, bankers, \nresearchers, and other capital market participants that access www.otcbb.com.  This \nnew tool allows access to information on the financial status, management, and \nbusiness activities of OTCBB companies. \n \nTotal trading volume data for all of the securities traded on the OTCBB can be found on \nwww.otcbb.com. \n \nPLR-149190-04 \n \n \n5 \n \nTaxpayer represents that the only remaining significant differences between the OTCBB \nand NASDAQ or the NYSE are fees and listing requirements imposed by NASDAQ or \nthe NYSE.  In general, these listing requirements prevent \u201cmicro-cap\u201d stocks from \neligibility on NASDAQ and the NYSE.  Thus, most companies whose stock is traded on \nthe OTCBB are either not large enough to meet the listing requirements or do not want \nto burden shareholders with the entry and annual listing fees charged for the privilege of \nbeing traded on a larger exchange. \n \nFacts concerning availability of market quotations: \n \nTaxpayer represents that market quotations and historical trade data for Company \ncommon stock are available through a variety of electronic information sources.  These \nsources include several internet financial sites that Taxpayer represents are well-known \nand heavily accessed.  These sites include Yahoo Finance, Tradingcharts.com, \nCBSMarketWatch.com, MSN Stock Quotes, Nasdaqtrader.com, and the OTCBB \nwebsite itself, www.otcbb.com. \n \nAt least one of these well-known and heavily accessed sites, B, maintains daily current \nand historical quotes for Company common stock from a date in the late 1990s to the \npresent.  For each business day, B provides historical data that includes the quotes \n(open, high, low, and close) and volume of trading.  Access to current and historical \nquotes for Company common stock on B is available at no charge (not even a de \nminimis charge) to the general public.  There is no need to register to have access to \nthe quotes on B.  There is no need to provide any information other than a stock symbol \nto have access to current and historical quotes for Company common stock on B. \n \nCompany common stock quotations are also published on the National Quotation \nBureau, or the \u201cPink Sheets.\u201d  The Pink Sheets are a vendor service that is the \npublication medium for many over-the-counter securities.  The Pink Sheets can be \naccessed electronically at www.pinksheets.com. \n \nMarket quotations for Company stock are not published in a newspaper of national \ncirculation. \n \nOn the day of the proposed contribution by Taxpayer of shares of Company common \nstock to Foundation, Taxpayer will print out current market quotation information on the \nOTCBB for Company common stock from Internet site B and print out historical market \nquotation data on the OTCBB including the quotes (open, high, low, and close) and \nvolume of trading for shares of Company common stock, for each business day of the \none year period ending on the date of the proposed contribution.  Taxpayer will save a \ncopy of this data in Taxpayer\u2019s records. \n \n \n \nPLR-149190-04 \n \n \n6 \n \n \nLAW \n \nSection 170(a) of the Code allows a deduction for any charitable contribution (as \ndefined in \u00a7 170(c)) payment of which is made within the taxable year. \n \nSection 1.170A-1(c)(1) of the Income Tax Regulations states that if a charitable \ncontribution is made in property other than money, the amount of the contribution is the \nfair market value of the property at the time of the contribution reduced as provided in \n\u00a7 170(e)(1) and paragraph (a) of \u00a7 1.170A-4. \n \nSection 170(e)(1)(B)(ii) of the Code provides that in the case of charitable contributions \nto or for the use of a private foundation (as defined in \u00a7 509(a)), other than a private \nfoundation described in \u00a7 170(b)(1)(E), the amount of the charitable contribution of \nproperty otherwise taken into account under \u00a7 170 is reduced by the amount of gain that \nwould have been long-term capital gain if the property contributed had been sold by the \ntaxpayer at its fair market value (determined at the time of the contribution). \n \nSection 170(e)(5)(A) of the Code states that \u00a7 170(e)(1)(B)(ii) does not apply to any \ncontribution of \"qualified appreciated stock.\" \n \nSection 170(e)(5)(B) of the Code defines \"qualified appreciated stock,\" except as \nprovided in \u00a7 170(e)(5)(C), to mean any stock of a corporation (i) for which (as of the \ndate of the contribution) market quotations are readily available on an established \nsecurities market, and (ii) which is capital gain property (as defined in \n\u00a7 170(b)(1)(C)(iv)). \n \nSection 170(e)(5)(C)(i) of the Code provides that, in the case of any donor, the term \n\"qualified appreciated stock\" shall not include any stock of a corporation contributed by \nthe donor in a contribution to which \u00a7 170(e)(1)(B)(ii) applies (determined without regard \nto \u00a7 170(e)(5)) to the extent that the amount of the stock so contributed (when increased \nby the aggregate amount of all prior such contributions by the donor of stock in such \ncorporation) exceeds 10 percent (in value) of all of the outstanding stock of such \ncorporation.  For purposes of \u00a7 170(e)(5)(C)(i), an individual shall be treated as making \nall contributions made by any member of his family (as defined in \u00a7 267(c)(4)).  Section \n170(e)(5)(C)(ii). \n \nSection 170(e)(5) was added to the Code by the Tax Reform Act of 1984, Pub. L. 98-\n369.  Congress believed \"that deductibility at full fair market value for gifts of \nappreciated stock to private nonoperating foundations should be permitted in certain \nsituations in which the potential for abuse, including overvaluations, is minimized.\"  H.R. \nRep. No. 432, 98th Cong., 2d Sess., pt. 2, at 1464 (1984).  To meet the requirement \nthat the stock be stock for which market quotations are readily available on an \n \nPLR-149190-04 \n \n \n7 \nestablished securities market, \"it is not sufficient merely that market quotations for the \nstock are readily available (e.g. from established brokerage firms); rather, the market \nquotations must be readily available on an established securities market.\"  Staff of the \nJoint Committee on Taxation, General Explanation of H.R. 4170, 98th Cong., 2d Sess. \n668 (1984). \n  \nSection 170(b)(1)(C)(iv) of the Code defines the term \"capital gain property\" to mean, \nwith respect to any contribution, any capital asset the sale of which at its fair market \nvalue at the time of the contribution would have resulted in gain which would have been \nlong-term capital gain. \n \nSection 1222(3) of the Code defines \"long-term capital gain\" to mean gain from the sale \nor exchange of a capital asset held for more than one year, if and to the extent the gain \nis taken into account in computing gross income. \n \nSection 1221 of the Code defines the term \"capital asset\" to mean property held by the \ntaxpayer (whether or not connected with his trade or business) but does not include (1) \nstock in trade; (2) certain property used in a trade or business; (3) certain property that \nis the product of the taxpayer's personal efforts; (4) accounts or notes receivable; (5) \ncertain publications of the United States government; (6) certain commodities derivative \nfinancial instruments; (7) certain hedging transactions; and (8) certain supplies. \n \nANALYSIS \n \nFor stock to be \"qualified appreciated stock,\" it must be described in \u00a7 170(e)(5)(B). \n \nIn determining whether the shares of Company common stock that Taxpayer plans to \ncontribute to Foundation are qualified appreciated stock, we first consider whether \nmarket quotations are readily available on an established securities market as required \nby \u00a7 170(e)(5)(B)(i). \n \nThe requirement that market quotations be readily available on an established securities \nmarket has the same meaning for the purpose of defining qualified appreciated stock \nand in determining when securities are publicly traded (so as to exempt a donor from \nthe substantiation requirements of \u00a7 1.170A-13(c)).  Todd v. Commissioner, 118 T.C. \n334, 345 (2002).  The rule for when market quotations are readily available on an \nestablished securities market for purposes of making such a determination is in \n\u00a7 1.170A-13(c)(7)(xi) of the regulations. \n \nSection 1.170A-13(c)(7)(xi)(A) provides that, for purposes of \u00a7 1.170A-13, market \nquotations are readily available on an established securities market with respect to a \nsecurity if: \n \n \nPLR-149190-04 \n \n \n8 \n1.  the security is listed on the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock \nExchange, or any city or regional exchange in which quotations are published on a daily \nbasis, including foreign securities listed on a recognized foreign, national, or regional \nexchange in which quotations are published on a daily basis; \n2.  the security is regularly traded in the national or regional over-the-counter market, for \nwhich published quotations are available; or \n3.  the security is a share of an open-ended investment company (commonly known as \na mutual fund) for which quotations are published on a daily basis in a newspaper of \ngeneral circulation throughout the United States. \n \nSection 1.170A-13(c)(7)(xi)(C) provides limitations on the definition of publicly traded \nsecurities.  Section 1.170A-13(c)(7)(xi)(C) provides that securities described in \n\u00a7 1.170A-13(c)(7)(xi)(A) or (B) are not considered publicly traded securities if (1) the \nsecurities are subject to any restrictions that materially affect the value of the securities \nto the donor or prevent the securities from being freely traded, or (2) if the amount \nclaimed or reported as a deduction with respect to the contribution of the securities is \ndifferent than the amount listed in the market quotations that are readily available on an \nestablished securities market pursuant to \u00a7 1.170A-13(c)(7)(xi)(A) or (B). \n \nSection 1.170A-13(c)(7)(xi)(D) provides that the fair market value of a publicly traded \nsecurity, as defined in \u00a7 1.170A-13(c)(7)(xi), is not necessarily equal to its market \nquotation, its average trading price, or its face value, if any. \n \nTreasury Decision 8199, 1988-1 C.B. 99 (May 5, 1988), adopted the finalized version of \n\u00a7 1.170A-13(c)(7)(xi) and it is generally effective for charitable contributions of property \nmade after December 31, 1984.   \n \nReadily Available Market Quotations \n \nIn this section of our analysis, we will determine whether market quotations are readily \navailable for Company common stock.  As stated above, the readily available market \nquotations requirement has the same meaning for the purpose of defining qualified \nappreciated stock as the definition in \u00a7 1.170A-13(c)(7)(xi).  See Todd, supra. \n \nSince Company common stock is not traded on a stock exchange and Company is not \nan open-ended investment company, Company common stock must meet the \nrequirements of \u00a7 1.170A-13(c)(7)(xi)(A)(2) to be qualified appreciated stock.  That \nmeans shares of Company common stock must be \u201cregularly traded in the national or \nregional over-the-counter market, for which published quotations are available.\u201d  \n(emphasis added).  In the following section of our analysis, we will consider the question \nof whether \u201cthe national or regional over-the-counter market\u201d includes the OTCBB.  \nHere, we consider whether Company common stock is \u201cregularly traded\u201d and whether \n\u201cpublished quotations are available.\u201d \n \n \nPLR-149190-04 \n \n \n9 \nFirst, we consider the phrase in the regulation \u201cregularly traded.\u201d  Based on our review \nof daily trade data for shares of Company common stock as reported on internet \nfinancial sites over the one year period prior to the issuance of this letter, we find that \nshares of Company common stock have been regularly traded during that one year \nperiod. \n \nNext, we consider the requirement in the regulation that \u201cpublished quotations are \navailable.\u201d  Whether \u201cpublished quotations are available\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 170(e)(5) in \nthe present case depends on whether this requirement is met when, as in the present \ncase, both current and historical market quotations for shares of Company common \nstock can be accessed on the internet without charge (not even a de minimis charge) by \nanyone without restriction or the need to supply information other than the stock symbol. \n \nSince \u00a7 1.170A-13(c)(7)(xi) was finalized by T.D. 8199 in 1988, the regulation was \nwritten before access to the internet was universal and before availability of financial \ninformation on the internet was as extensive as now.  Thus, the Service could not have \nconsidered in 1988 whether the fact that quotations are available without charge to the \ngeneral public on the internet means that \u201cpublished quotations are available.\u201d  The \nbasic issue is whether putting information on the internet without any restrictions on who \ncan access that information means that the information is published for purposes of \n\u00a7 170(e)(5).  (There may be cases in which market quotations for the common stock of \na company are available on the Internet for such a short period that they cannot be \nconsidered \u201cpublished\u201d for purposes of the regulations.  Such a problem does not arise \nin the present case, however, since daily historical market quotations for Company \ncommon stock going back several years are available on Internet site B.) \n \nIn determining whether \u201cpublished quotations are available\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 1.170A-\n13(c)(7)(xi)(A)(2) we must analyze whether such a finding is consistent with the \nintentions of Congress when it passed \u00a7 170(e)(5).  As stated above, the legislative \nhistory shows that Congress intended to limit the qualified appreciated stock exception \nto certain situations in which the potential for abuse, including overvaluations, is \nminimized.  Such a potential for overvaluation would be minimized only if the market \nquotations on the OTCBB are a reliable reflection of the fair market value of stock \ntraded on the OTCBB.  (See \u00a7 1.170A-13(c)(7)(xi)(C)(2), providing that \u201cSecurities \ndescribed in [\u00a7 1.170A-13(c)(7)(xi)(A)] shall not be considered publicly traded securities  \n\u2026 (2) If the amount claimed or reported as a deduction with respect to the contribution \nof the securities is different than the amount listed in the market quotations that are \nreadily available on an established securities market pursuant to [\u00a7 1.170A-\n13(c)(7)(xi)(A)]\u201d) \n \nAlso, the Joint Committee report states that to meet the requirement that the stock be \nstock for which market quotations are readily available on an established securities \nmarket, \"it is not sufficient merely that market quotations for the stock are readily \navailable (e.g. from established brokerage firms); rather, the market quotations must be \n \nPLR-149190-04 \n \n \n10 \nreadily available on an established securities market.\"  Staff of the Joint Committee on \nTaxation, General Explanation of H.R. 4170, 98th Cong., 2d Sess. 668 (1984).  In the \nfollowing section of our analysis, we will consider the issue of whether the OTCBB is an \nestablished securities market.  For purposes of our discussion in this section, we will \nassume that it is.  In the present case, one does not need to go to a broker to get \nmarket quotations for Company common stock.  Rather, trades in shares of domestic \nover-the-counter equity securities that are listed on the OTCBB are reported through the \nACT within 90 seconds of the transaction, and made available to the general public on \nthe internet site of the OTCBB, as well as other financial internet sites. \n \nIn determining whether market quotations for shares of Company common stock are \n\u201cpublished\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 1.170A-13(c)(7)(xi)(A)(2), we consider what is consistent \nwith the intention of Congress to limit the qualified appreciated stock exception to \ncertain situations in which the potential for abuse, including overvaluations, is \nminimized.  Making the quotations available on the internet does serve to minimize the \npotential for abuse, because enabling virtually anyone in the world with access to the \ninternet to view current and historical market quotations for Company common stock \nmeans that the possibility is maximized that someone would detect a situation in which \nthe market quotations are not reasonable. \n \nIn determining whether market quotations for Company common stock are \u201creadily \navailable,\u201d as required by \u00a7 170(e)(5)(B)(i), we note the ease with which anyone can \naccess current and historical market quotations on the OTCBB internet site and other \nfinancial internet sites.  At least one of these well-known and heavily accessed internet \nsites, B, maintains daily current and historical quotes for shares of Company common \nstock from a date in the late 1990s to the present.  For each business day B provides \nhistorical data that includes the quotes (open, high, low, and close) and trade volume.  \nAccess to current and historical quotes for shares of Company common stock on B is \navailable at no charge (not even a de minimis charge) to the general public.  There is no \nneed to register to have access to the quotes on B.  There is no need to provide any \ninformation other than a stock symbol to have access to current and historical quotes for \nshares of Company common stock on B. \n \nTherefore, market quotations for shares of Company common stock are \u201creadily \navailable\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 170(e)(5). \n \nEstablished Securities Market: \n \nNext, we will determine whether the OTCBB is an established securities market for \npurposes of \u00a7 170)(e)(5).  As stated above, this requirement has the same meaning for \nthe purpose of defining qualified appreciated stock as the definition in \u00a7 1.170A-\n13(c)(7)(xi). \n \n \nPLR-149190-04 \n \n \n11 \nAs discussed in the preceding section, Company common stock must meet the \nrequirements of \u00a7 1.170A-13(c)(7)(xi)(A)(2) to be qualified appreciated stock.  Thus, \nCompany common stock must be regularly traded in the national or regional over-the-\ncounter market, for which published quotations are available.  Although this regulation \ndoes not state which specific securities market or markets are \u201cthe national or regional \nover-the-counter market,\u201d it has always been accepted that this definition obviously \napplies to the NASDAQ National Market.  (Compare this to \u00a7 1.170A-13(c)(7)(xi)(A)(1), \nwhich mentions the NYSE and the American Stock Exchange by name.)  Since \n\u00a7 1.170A-13(c)(7)(xi) was finalized by T.D. 8199 in 1988 and the OTCBB was created to \ncomply with The Penny Stock Reform Act of 1990, the Service could not have \nconsidered whether the OTCBB is an established securities market when T.D. 8199 \nwas issued. \n \nIn determining whether the OTCBB is an established securities market for purposes of \n\u00a7 170(e)(5), we must analyze whether a finding that the OTCBB is described in \n\u00a7 1.170A-13(c)(7)(xi)(A)(2) is consistent with the intentions of Congress when it passed \n\u00a7 170(e)(5).  As stated above, the legislative history shows that Congress intended to \nlimit the qualified appreciated stock exception to certain situations in which the potential \nfor abuse, including overvaluations, is minimized.  Such a potential for overvaluation \nwould be minimized only if the market quotations on the OTCBB are a reliable reflection \nof the fair market value of stock traded on the OTCBB.  This depends on whether, under \nthe facts and circumstances, there are enough safeguards in how the OTCBB operates \nand how securities traded on the OTCBB are regulated that the market quotations on \nthe OTCBB can be relied on to reflect the fair market value of the securities. \n \nBased on the definitions of over-the-counter markets that Taxpayer submitted, the \nOTCBB is an over-the-counter market.  As stated above, \u00a7 1.170A-13(c)(7)(xi)(A)(2) \ndoes not mention any over-the-counter markets by name.  Since the regulation uses the \nphrase \u201cin the national or regional over-the-counter market,\u201d it is clear that more than \none over-the-counter market can be an established securities market for purposes of \n\u00a7 170(e)(5).  There is still the question, however, of whether the OTCBB is described in \n\u00a7 1.170A-13(c)(7)(xi)(A)(2). \n \nTaxpayer points out changes that have been made to the OTCBB since its creation in \n1990 and also points out changes that have been made to regulation of the securities \nindustry as a whole since 1990.  Since \u00a7 170(e)(5)(B)(i) provides that the determination \nof whether market quotations are readily available on an established securities market \nis made \u201cas of the date of the contribution,\u201d we look to how the OTCBB exists currently \nto determine whether it is an established securities market for purposes of \u00a7 170(e)(5). \n \nUnder the facts presented by Taxpayer, we find that the OTCBB is an established \nsecurities market for purposes of \u00a7 170(e)(5).  This finding is consistent with the intent \nof Congress that the exception in \u00a7 170(e)(5) be limited to those situations in which the \npotential for abuse, including overvaluations, can be minimized.  Support for this finding \n \nPLR-149190-04 \n \n \n12 \nis based on the facts and circumstances including, among others, how the OTCBB was \ncreated, how long it has existed, its permanence, the rules for listing a stock on the \nOTCBB, reporting requirements for trades on the OTCBB, reporting requirements for \ncompanies whose stocks are listed on the OTCBB, laws and regulations that apply to \nMarket Makers, and how the OTCBB is regulated both by the government and by \nNASDAQ. \n  \n \n \nCapital Gain Property \n \nTo meet the requirements of \u00a7 170(e)(5)(B)(ii), the shares of Company common stock \nmust be capital gain property within the meaning of \u00a7 170(b)(1)(C)(iv), which means that \nthe shares would have to result in long-term capital gain if sold at their fair market value.  \nUnder \u00a7 1222(3), long-term capital gain results from the sale of a capital asset held for \nmore than one year.  Taxpayer represents that, at the time of the contribution, Taxpayer \nwill have held the contributed shares of Company common stock for more than one year \nand will not come within any of the exceptions set forth in \u00a7 1221.  In addition, Taxpayer \nanticipates that the fair market value of the shares of Company common stock on the \ncontribution date will be more than the adjusted basis.  Based upon Taxpayer\u2019s \nrepresentations, we conclude that the shares of Company common stock that will be \ncontributed to Foundation represent long-term capital gain property within the meaning \nof \u00a7 170(b)(1)(C)(iv), and Taxpayer\u2019s contribution of the shares will meet the \nrequirements of \u00a7 170(e)(5)(B)(ii). \n \nSince clauses (i) and (ii) of \u00a7 170(e)(5)(B) are met, and Taxpayer will not contribute \nmore than 10 percent (within the meaning of \u00a7 170(e)(5)(C)) of all outstanding stock of \nCompany to Foundation, we conclude that the shares of Company common stock that \nTaxpayer plans to contribute to Foundation are qualified appreciated stock within the \nmeaning of \u00a7 170(e)(5). \n \nOur ruling is contingent on Company common stock being regularly traded on the \nOTCBB on the date of the contribution.  See \u00a7 1.170A-13(c)(7)(xi)(A)(2). \n \nOur ruling is also contingent on Taxpayer printing out and saving current and historical \nmarket quotations for shares of Company common stock as described above in the \nFacts section. \n \nOur ruling is also contingent on current and historical market quotations (including \nquotes (open, high, low, and close) and volume of trading) being as easily accessible \nwithout cost on Internet site B as it is described above in the Facts section on the date \nof the contribution. \n \n \nPLR-149190-04 \n \n \n13 \nThe rulings contained in this letter are based upon information and representations \nsubmitted by the taxpayer and accompanied by a penalty of perjury statement executed \nby an appropriate party.

These Contracts were originally issued by Company B\u2019s\npredecessor, Company A, but are now the responsibility of Company C by reason of an\nassumption reinsurance agreement.  In a few cases, pending policyholder consent to\nthe assumption, those Contracts are still the responsibility of Company B.\n2\nPLR-111886-99\nFacts\nCompany C is a State C stock life insurance company, as defined by\nsection 816(a), and is subject to taxation under Part I of Subchapter L of the Code. \nTaxpayer is licensed to engage in the life insurance business in Number C states and\nthe District of Columbia.  Company C is a member of an affiliated group that files its\nFederal income tax returns on a consolidated basis.  Company C is subject to the audit\njurisdiction of the District Director in Location C.  Company C uses the accrual method\nof accounting for income tax purposes and files its returns on a calendar year basis.\nCompany B is a State B stock life insurance company, as defined by section\n816(a), and is subject to taxation under Part I of Subchapter L of the Code.  Company B\nis licensed to engage in the life insurance business in Number B states.  Company B is\na member of an affiliated group that files its Federal income tax returns on a\nconsolidated basis.  Company B is subject to the audit jurisdiction of the District Director\nin Location B.  Company B uses the accrual method of accounting for income tax\npurposes and files its returns on a calendar year basis.\nCompany B was acquired by its current parent on Date D essentially as a shell\ncorporation whose principal assets consisted of licenses to conduct the business of life\ninsurance.  Prior to that acquisition, Company B was known as Company A and was a\nwholly owned subsidiary of Company C from Date E until its acquisition on Date D. \nDuring the period of ownership of Company B by Company C, Company C assumed all\nof Company B\u2019s business pursuant to an assumption reinsurance transaction, including\napproximately Number F Contracts.  A small number of Contracts remain with\nCompany B, however, pending receipt of consent to the assumption reinsurance\ntransaction by the owners of the contracts.  All of the Contracts are currently being\nadministered by Company C.  Companies B and C have entered into an indemnity\nreinsurance agreement regarding these contracts.  \nAs both companies have responsibilities for liabilities arising from any failure of\nthe Contracts to comply with the requirements of sections 7702, the Contracts are\nconsidered in the aggregate for this ruling request, without regard to their current\nholder.\nCompanies B and C represent that the Contracts are life insurance contracts\nunder applicable state law and, apart from contracts issued before 1985, were intended\nto qualify as life insurance contracts within the meaning of section 7702 by satisfying\nthe guideline premium limitation of section 7702(c) and the cash value corridor of\nsection 7702(d).  Similarly, flexible premium Contracts issued before 1985 were\nintended to satisfy the guideline premium limitation of section 101(f)(2) and the cash\nvalue corridor described in sections 101(f)(1)(A)(ii) and 101(f)(3)(C).  These\nrequirements parallel the correlative provisions of section 7702 insofar as relevant to\nthis ruling request and thus are not discussed in detail below.\n3\nPLR-111886-99\nCompany B maintained procedures that were designed to ensure compliance\nwith the guideline premium limitations.  Those procedures included both the extensive\nuse of mainframe computers and manual review in the case of situations identified by\nthe computer as having potential for failure.  If such a situation arose, company\npersonnel were required to manually enter the data relevant to the contract in a\nsecondary personal computer-based system that produced illustrations of the\nappropriate guideline single and level premiums for the product both for use in\nmarketing and to verify compliance.  The process required was iterative and required\nextensive manual input until the late 1980\u2019s when this portion of the process began to\nbe performed automatically.\nIf the compliance procedures identified a contract as having premiums received\nthat were in excess of the contract\u2019s guideline premium limitation, compliance personnel\nsent a notice to the policyholder offering a variety of options.  The default option was an\nactual refund, by check, of the excess premium with interest at the contract crediting\nrate.   Alternatively, excess premiums plus interest could be retained by the company,\nat the policyholder\u2019s option, to purchase a deferred annuity contract or be applied to\npolicy loans, if any were outstanding.  A further option, subject to underwriting approval,\nwas an increase in the contract\u2019s death benefit to an amount sufficient to ensure\ncompliance with section 101(f) or section 7702, as applicable.  In all events, Company\nB was required to issue a Form 1099-INT for the amount of interest paid on the excess\npremium even if that excess premium plus interest was subsequently used to acquire\nan additional benefit \u2013 a deferred annuity contract, reduction of a policy loan, or an\nincrease in the contract\u2019s face amount.\nIn the case of Number G Contracts, compliance personnel failed to refund the\nexcess premiums with interest due to clerical errors that were contrary to established\nprocedures.  Specifically, in some instances, the personnel failed to effect the\ncorrection within 60 days after the end of the contract year due to inaction or failure to\nnote the notation on the computer reports of excess premiums.  In other instances, the\namount of the excess premium was incorrectly calculated, due to errors in the manual\nentry portion of the compliance process.  Had proper procedures been followed and\nclerical errors had not occurred, the Contracts would not have failed to satisfy the\nguideline premium limitation.\nIn the case of Number H Contracts, the failure to comply had a very different\ncause, that of a misinterpretation of the adjustment rules of sections 101(f)(2)(E) and\n7702(f)(7)(A).   Company B\u2019s mainframe compliance system reflected adjustments by\ndetermining a guideline single premium for the existing death benefit by determining a\nguideline single premium for the existing death benefit using the issue age of the\ninsured.  In addition, the personal computer-based illustration system made\nadjustments upon a change in the contract\u2019s benefits by taking into account the overall\nbenefit structure (from issue to maturity) as known at the time of the change. \nSpecifically this second system determined the guideline premium limitation that would\n4\nPLR-111886-99\napply if the contract had been issued with the expectation that the benefits would\nincrease or decrease on the date of the adjustment.  Company B\u2019s method generally\nresulted in lower guideline premium limitations upon an increase in benefits and a\nhigher guideline premium limitation upon a decrease in benefits than the results that\nwould be obtained by use of the \u201cattained age decrement\u201d method more commonly\nused in the industry, as more fully described below.\nCompany B received advice in a June 5, 1987 letter from the actuarial consulting\nfirm of Company I regarding the proper adjustment method to use.  In particular,\nCompany I referred Company B to the 1982 colloquy between Senators Dole and\nBentsen in connection with the adjustment rule of section 101(f)(2)(E), which is\ngenerally viewed as the road map for the section 7702(f)(7)(A) adjustment rule.  The\nletter noted, however, that no regulations had yet been published under section 7702. \nCompany B\u2019s personnel charged with maintaining compliance with sections 101(f) and\n7702 understood the letter in its totality to mean that no change would be required in\nCompany B\u2019s procedures pending the issuance of such regulations.\nIn its more recent examination of the issue of whether \u201cproper\u201d adjustments upon\nchanges in benefits or terms were performed using Company B\u2019s method, the two\nCompanies have consulted with Person J, a reputable actuary.  Specifically,\nCompanies B and C asked whether Company B\u2019s adjustment method was reasonable\nfrom an actuarial perspective and were told yes.\nLaw and Analysis\nSection 101(f) was added to the Code by section 221 of the Tax Equity and\nFiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 (TEFRA), 1982-2 C.B. 462.  Under section 101(f), any\namount paid by reason of the death of the insured under a life insurance contract\ndescribed as a flexible premium contract is excluded from gross income only if the\ncontract satisfies either (1) the guideline premium limitation and the applicable\npercentage of cash value test of section 101(f)(1)(A)(i) and (ii), respectively, or (2) the\ncash value test of section 101(f)(1)(B).  The limitations of section 101(f) are applicable\ngenerally only to contracts issued before January 1, 1985.\nSection 101(f)(2)(E) provides that a flexible premium life insurance contract's\nguideline premiums are adjusted in the event of a change in the contract's future\nbenefits or any qualified additional benefit if the change was not reflected in any\nguideline single premium previously determined.  The legislative history of section\n101(f) explains:\nAt the start of the contract the guideline premiums are based on the future\nbenefits specified in the contract as of such date.  If future contract benefits are\nchanged at a subsequent date, the guideline premiums will be adjusted (upward\nor downward) to reflect the change.\n5\nPLR-111886-99\nS. Rep. No. 494 (Vol. 1), 97th Cong., 2d Sess 354 (1982).  See also H.R. Rep. 760,\n98th Cong., 2d Sess. 648 (1982) (conference agreement generally follows the Senate\namendment).\nA colloquy between Senator Dole and Senator Bentsen provides the following\nexplanation regarding the circumstances under which guideline premiums are to be\nadjusted:\nMr. Bentsen.  Paragraph (2)(E)...states that if the death benefits or rider\nbenefits are changed after issue of these policies, adjustments will need to be\nmade....I understand that such adjustments are only to be made in two\nsituations: First, if the change represents a previously scheduled benefit increase\nthat was not reflected in the guideline premiums because of the so-called\ncomputational rules; or second, if the change is initiated by the policyholder to\nalter the amount or pattern of the benefits.  Is this correct?\nMr. Dole.  That is my understanding.\n128 Cong. Rec. S10943, August 19, 1982.  \nIn general, for contracts issued after 1984, section 7702 provides a definition of\nthe term \"life insurance contract\" for all purposes of the Code.  To satisfy this definition,\na life insurance or endowment contract must be treated as such under the applicable\nstate law.  A contract must also satisfy one of two alternative tests: (1) the cash value\naccumulation test of section 7702(a)(1), or (2) the guideline premium requirements and\nthe cash value corridor test of section 7702(a)(2)(A) and (B).  \nThe guideline premium limitation of section 7702(c) provides that the premiums\npaid under the contract at any time must not exceed the greater of the guideline single\npremium or the sum of the guideline level premiums to that date.  The guideline single\npremium is the single premium at issue that is needed to fund the future benefits under\nthe contract using the mortality and other charges specified in section 7702(c)(3)(B) and\ninterest at the greater of an annual effective rate of six percent or the rate or rates\nguaranteed on issuance of the contract.  The guideline level premium is the level\nannual equivalent of the guideline single premium payable until a deemed maturity date\nbetween the insured\u2019s attained ages 95 and 100, with interest at the greater of an\nannual effective rate of four percent or the rate or rates guaranteed on issuance of the\ncontract.  The computational rules of section 7702(e) and the definitions of\nsection 7702(f) apply to both the guideline single and guideline level premiums.\nSection 7702(f)(7)(A) requires, in general, that if there is a change in the benefits\nunder (or in other terms of) the contract which was not reflected in any previous\ndetermination or adjustment made under section 7702, there shall be proper\nadjustments in future determinations made under the section.  The statute itself\n6\nPLR-111886-99\nprovides no guidance on what constitute \u201cproper adjustments.\u201d\nThe legislative history concerning what constitute \u201cproper adjustments\u201d is at best\nambiguous.  There is no legislative history contemporaneous with the inclusion of that\nterm in section 7702(f)(7)(A) in 1984.  The Tax Reform Act of 1986 included technical\ncorrections to the 1984 legislation, including amendments to section 7702(f)(7).  The\nexplanation of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 by the Staff of the Joint Committee contains\nthe following description of an attained age decrement method to be used in making\n\u201cproper adjustments\u201d after a reduction in benefits:\nUnder [the attained age decrement method], when benefits under the\ncontract are reduced, the guideline level and single premium limitations\nare each adjusted and redetermined by subtracting from the original\nguideline premium limitation a \u201cnegative guideline premium limitation\u201d\nwhich is determined as of the date of the reduction in benefits and at the\nattained age of the insured on such date.  The negative guideline\npremium limitation is the guideline premium limitation for an insurance\ncontract that, when combined with the original insurance contract after the\nreduction in benefits,\u201d produces an insurance contract with the same\nbenefit as the original contract before such reduction.\nJoint Committee on Taxation, 99th Cong., 2d Sess., Explanation of Technical\nCorrections to the Tax Reform Act of 1984 and Other Recent Tax Legislation, at 108\n(Comm. Print 1987); see also H. R. Rep. No. 426, 99th Cong., 1st Sess. 967-968 (1985),\n1986-3 C.B. Vol. 2, 967-968 (the language above is taken from this report verbatim. \nThe terms \u201cguideline level and single premium limitations\u201d are not in the Code and do\nnot appear to be \u201cdeterminations.\u201d\nPursuant to section 7702(f)(8), the Secretary of the Treasury may waive a failure\nto satisfy the requirements of section 7702.  This waiver is granted if a taxpayer\nestablishes that the statutory requirements were not satisfied due to reasonable error\nand that reasonable steps are being taken to remedy the error.\n \nBased on all of the facts, law, and arguments presented, we conclude that the\nfailure of Number G Contracts to satisfy the requirements of section 101(f) or section\n7702, as applicable, is due to reasonable error.  In those instances, the excess\npremiums were either paid or retained as the result of human error in the operation of\nthe compliance system for monitoring compliance with the guideline premium limitations\nof sections 101(f) and 7702(c), as applicable.  Company B had procedures existing at\nthat time that, if properly followed, would have resulted in the Contracts complying with\nthe statute.\nWe also conclude that the failure of Number H Contracts to satisfy the\nrequirements of section 101(f) or section 7702, as applicable, is due to reasonable\n7\nPLR-111886-99\nerror.  Company B concedes that its method is an erroneous construction of the\nadjustment rule and differs from the more widely applied interpretation of the method\nrequired upon adjustments governed by sections 101(f)(2)(E) and 7702(f)(7)(A). \nCompany B\u2019s error, however, is reasonable within the meaning of section 7702(f)(8). \nThe requirement to use the attained age decrement method does not appear in section\n7702(f)(7)(A) itself.  Considerable confusion has occurred in the application of the\nmechanics of the attained age decrement method and the interpretation of the unclear\nlegislative history and Blue Book language, reflecting the ambiguity of the statutory\nprovision.  Company B\u2019s method took attained age into account, albeit incorrectly, in\nmaking the adjustments required by section 7702(f)(7), and was in our view a\nreasonable error.  Company C has taken reasonable steps to remedy the error by\nfollowing a more proper methodology.\nFinally, we conclude that premiums paid on a Contract in excess of the guideline\npremium limitation during a policy year (\u201cexcess premiums\u201d) and interest thereon,\ncalculated at the Contract crediting rate, are treated as distributed to the policyholder,\nwith interest to be reported to the policyholder on a Form 1099-INT, even if the excess\npremiums and interest are not actually returned to the policyholder by check.  In such a\nsituation, the excess premiums plus interest that are treated as  distributed and then\nreturned to the life insurance company as new and additional premiums paid for the\nContract that are used to increase the Contract\u2019s death benefit within 60 days of the\nclose of a policy year, will satisfy the requirements for distributions of excess premiums\nplus interest mandated by section 101(f)(3)(B) and section 7702(f)(1)(B) and (C), as\nappropriate.\nWe express no opinion as to the tax treatment of the Contracts under the\nprovisions of any other sections of the Code and income tax regulations that may also\nbe applicable thereto.  No opinion is expressed as to the compliance of these Contracts\nwith other requirements of section 101(f) or section 7702.  \nThis ruling letter is directed only to the taxpayer who requested it.

(Hereinafter, all\nsection references are to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.)\nThe rulings given in this letter are based on facts and representations submitted by\nParent and its subsidiaries and accompanied by a penalties of perjury statement\nexecuted by an appropriate party.  This office has not verified any of the materials\nsubmitted in support of the request for rulings.  Verification of the information,\nrepresentations, and other data may be required as part of the audit process.\nFacts\nParent is a publicly-traded domestic corporation that is engaged in various lines of\nbusiness through its many subsidiaries, including the life insurance business.  Parent\nowns all the stock of IHC, a State A holding corporation for Parent\u2019s life insurance\nsubsidiaries operating in foreign countries.  CFC1 is a wholly-owned subsidiary of IHC. \nCFC2 is an indirect-wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent.  CFC1 and CFC2 were formed\nunder the laws of Country A and are engaged in the life insurance business in Country\nA.  Each is a controlled foreign corporation as defined in section 957.\nCountry A regulates any insurance business conducted in Country A through its\ninsurance laws and regulations.  A government agency (the \u201cAgency\u201d) is responsible for\nenforcing insurance laws and regulations in Country A.  An insurance company must\nobtain a license from the Agency to conduct an insurance business in Country A.\nCFC1 and CFC2 are licensed by the Agency to sell life insurance and annuity contracts\nto residents of Country A and are subject to regulation by the Agency as life insurance\ncompanies.  Each derives more than 50 percent of its aggregate net written premiums\nfrom its issuance of life insurance and annuity contracts covering risks in connection\nwith the lives or health of residents of Country A and with respect to which no\npolicyholder, insured, annuitant, or beneficiary is a related person as defined in section\n954(d)(3).  The life insurance and annuity contracts issued by CFC1 and CFC2 are\nregulated as life insurance and annuity contracts by the Agency.  Parent has\nrepresented that CFC1 and CFC2 would be subject to tax under Subchapter L if they\nwere domestic corporations.\n- 3 -\nAs required by Country A\u2019s insurance laws and regulations: (i) CFC1 and CFC2 file\nannual reports (\u201cAnnual Reports\u201d) with the Agency; (ii) CFC1's and CFC2's Annual\nReports are audited by an outside accounting auditor in addition to the company\u2019s\nauditor; (iii) the accounting records of CFC1 and CFC2 that form the basis for preparing\nthe Annual Reports are subject to inspection by the Agency at any time; and (iv) CFC1's\nand CFC2's Annual Reports are made available to the public.  CFC1's and CFC2's\nAnnual Reports are used for financial purposes in addition to regulatory purposes, such\nas for credit rating purposes.  Month Y is the official year-end for life insurance\ncompanies operating in Country A.\nIn accordance with required rules for life insurance companies conducting business in\nCountry A, CFC1 and CFC2 each set forth the computation method for its underwriting\nreserves on its license application. The computation method must be based on an\nactuarial calculation, must be reasonable and appropriate, and must conform to any\nother standards prescribed by the Agency.  Any change in the method of calculating\nsuch reserves requires advance notice to the Agency and may not be allowed by the\nAgency.\nTo comply with Country A\u2019s insurance laws, regulations, and other guidance\npromulgated by the Agency, CFC1 and CFC2 must establish and maintain certain\nreserves for obligations to holders of their life insurance and annuity contracts and must\nset forth the amount of such reserves on the Annual Report.  These reserves are (1)\nunderwriting reserves (including reserves for variable contracts), (2) loss reserves, and\n(3) policyholder dividend reserves.  The rules for calculating  these reserves are\nprescribed by insurance laws and regulations and other Agency guidance and are\nsummarized below.\nUnderwriting reserves must be held to secure the performance of obligations arising in\nthe future from the life insurance and annuity contracts issued by CFC1 and CFC2 in\nCountry A.  Underwriting reserves are comprised of insurance premium reserves,\nunearned premium reserves, and risk reserves.  The sum of insurance premium\nreserves and unearned premium reserves (referred to as the \u201cstandard valuation\nreserve\u201d) for life insurance and annuity contracts may not be less than the amount\ncalculated in accordance with the designations of the Agency concerning the reserve\nmethod, interest rate, mortality rate and other coefficients.\nThe Agency requires life insurance reserves to be determined as follows: (1) the\nprescribed reserve method for life insurance is the net level premium (\u201cNLP\u201d) method;\n(2) the prescribed mortality table is the standard mortality table generated by the\ninstitute of actuaries of Country A; and (3) the prescribed standard interest rate\nassumption is based on 10-year government bonds of Country A.  \nThe Agency requires fixed annuity reserves to be determined using the same\nassumptions as life insurance reserves except that a different mortality table is\nprescribed.  Under the prescribed rules for variable annuity reserves, the total of\namounts credited to the separate accounts for policyholders must be held as premium\nreserves.\n- 4 -\nNotwithstanding that the NLP reserve method is the Agency-prescribed reserve\nmethod, the Agency has granted CFC1 and CFC2 approval to use the 5-year Zillmer\nmethod to calculate its standard valuation reserve for a period of time before reaching\nNLP reserves.  Because they use the 5-year Zillmer method, CFC1's and CFC2's \nstandard valuation reserves are less than those reserves would be under the NLP\nreserve method.   As a result, the Agency also requires CFC1 and CFC2 to maintain\nadditional risk reserves. \nThe risk reserves are comprised of a mortality risk reserve and an interest rate\nassumption risk reserve.  The predominate part of the mortality risk reserve is for\nordinary death risk, which is generally equal to .6 per 1000 net amount at risk under the\npolicy.  The interest rate assumption risk reserve is calculated as the sum of (i) a factor,\ndepending on the interest rate assumption, times the standard valuation reserve (for\ncurrent issues, the factor is .01) and (ii) 3 percent of the standard valuation reserve. \nCurrently, CFC1 is required to hold a mortality risk reserve but has Agency approval to\nnot hold an interest rate assumption reserve.  Such approval is effective only when\nCFC1's interest spread is negative.  CFC2 holds both types of risk reserves.\nCurrently, the total underwriting reserves held by CFC1 and CFC2 for life insurance and\nfixed annuity contracts are less than the standard valuation reserves would be for such\ncontracts if calculated using the NLP method.\nLoss reserves must be held for outstanding claims (including incurred but not reported\nclaims) under life insurance and annuity contracts issued by CFC1 and CFC2 in\nCountry A.  CFC1 and CFC2 calculate the reserves using each company\u2019s individual\nloss experience, in accordance with rules and regulations prescribed by the Agency.\nCertain of CFC1's and CFC2's contracts provide for policyholder dividends.  Reserves\nmust be held for any such amounts due policyholders.  These dividend reserves, like\nthe underwriting and loss reserves, are required by the Agency. Policyholder dividends\ninclude regular policyholder dividends declared by the company and, in the case of\nCFC2, special policyholder dividends, which account for most of the policyholder\ndividend reserves.  The special policyholder dividend is the result of a particular set of\ncircumstances in Country A where CFC2 is obligated to return to policyholders\napproximately X percent of favorable investment experience on assets supporting\ncertain contracts.\nIn accordance with required rules for life insurance companies licensed to do business\nin Country A, CFC1 and CFC2 have each appointed a qualified actuary to be involved\nin matters prescribed by the Agency as actuarial matters, including the method of\ncalculating reserves.  The actuary must have knowledge and experience concerning\nactuarial matters and must meet requirements prescribed by the Agency.  The actuary\nis required to submit a written opinion to the Board of Directors of the company and to\nthe Agency concerning whether or not the reserves relating to the insurance contracts\nprescribed by the Agency are established and maintained in accordance with actuarial\nsoundness.\n- 5 -\nParent and certain of its subsidiaries have requested rulings that the underwriting\nreserves, loss reserves, and policyholder dividend reserves, which are required to be\nmaintained by CFC1 and CFC2 by the Agency for their life insurance and annuity\ncontracts on Annual Reports, are an appropriate means of measuring income within the\nmeaning of section 954(i)(4)(B)(ii) and, accordingly, the amount of those reserves may\nbe used in determining each company\u2019s foreign personal holding company income\nunder section 954.\nLaw\nIn general, a United States shareholder of a controlled foreign corporation (\u201cCFC\u201d) must\ninclude in gross income its pro-rata share of the CFC\u2019s Subpart F income for each year. \nI.R.C. Sec. 951(a).  Subpart F income includes, among other types of income, foreign\nbase company income.  Sec. 952(a).  Section 954(a)(1) defines the term \u201cforeign base\ncompany income\u201d to include, among other types of income, foreign personal holding\ncompany income.  Section 954(c)(1) sets forth the types of income (e.g., interest and\ndividends) that are considered to be foreign personal holding company income.  Sec.\n954(c)(1)(A).  Section 954(i)(1) provides that for purposes of section 954(c)(1), foreign\npersonal holding company income does not include \u201cqualified insurance income\u201d of a\n\u201cqualifying insurance company\u201d. \nSection 953(e)(3) defines a \u201cqualifying insurance company\u201d as any controlled foreign\ncorporation which:\n(A)\nis subject to regulation as an insurance company by its home country, and is\nlicensed, authorized, or regulated by the applicable insurance regulatory body for its\nhome country to sell insurance or annuity contracts to persons other than related\npersons (within the meaning of Code section 954(d)(3)) in such home country;\n(B)\nderives more than 50 percent of its aggregate net written premiums from the\nissuance by such controlled foreign corporation of contracts covering applicable home\ncountry risks of such corporation and with respect to which no policyholder, insured,\nannuitant, or beneficiary is a related person (as defined in Code section 954(d)(3)); and\n(C)\nis engaged in the insurance business and would be subject to tax under\nSubchapter L if it were a domestic corporation.\nSection 953(e)(2)(B)(ii) defines the term \u201capplicable home country risks\u201d to include risks\nin connection with the lives or health of residents of the home country of the qualifying\ninsurance company issuing the contract covering the risks.\nSection 954(i)(2) defines the term \u201cqualified insurance income\u201d to mean income of a\nqualifying insurance company falling into either of two categories.  First, income\nreceived from unrelated persons and derived from investments made by a qualifying\ninsurance company or qualifying insurance company branch (collectively referred to as\na \u201cQIC\u201d) either of its reserves allocable to exempt contracts or of 80 percent of its\nunearned premiums from exempt contracts (as both are determined in accordance with\n- 6 -\nsection 954(i)(4)).  Sec. 954(i)(2)(A).  Second, income received from unrelated persons\nand derived from investments made by a QIC of an amount of its assets allocable to\nexempt contracts equal to: (1) in the case of property, casualty, or health insurance\ncontracts, one-third of the premiums earned on those contracts during such year; and\n(2) in the case of life insurance or annuity contracts, 10 percent of the reserves\ndescribed in section 954(i)(2)(A) for such contracts.  Sec. 954(i)(2)(B).\nExempt contracts are defined under section 953(e)(2) to include insurance or annuity\ncontracts issued by a qualifying insurance company in connection with the lives or\nhealth of residents of a country other than the U.S., but only if such company derives\nmore than 30 percent of its net written premiums from otherwise exempt contracts\nwhich cover applicable home country risks and with respect to which no policyholder,\ninsured, annuitant or beneficiary is a related person within the meaning of section\n954(d)(3).\nSection 954(i)(4)(B)(i) generally provides that in the case of life insurance and annuity\ncontracts, a QIC\u2019s reserves allocable to exempt contracts are equal to the greater of (1)\nthe net surrender value of the contract or (2) the reserve determined under section\n954(i)(5).  Section 954(i)(4)(B)(ii), however,  provides:\nThe amount of the reserves under Code section 954(i)(4)(B)(i) shall be the\nforeign statement reserve for the contract (less any catastrophe,\ndeficiency, equalization, or similar reserves), if, pursuant to a ruling\nrequest submitted by the taxpayer or as provided in published guidance,\nthe Secretary determines that the factors taken into account in\ndetermining the foreign statement reserve provide an appropriate means\nof measuring income.\nCode section 954(i)(4)(B)(ii) was enacted by section 614 of the Job Creation and\nWorker Assistance Act of 2002.  The staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation explains\nthis provision as follows:\nThe provision does, however, permit a taxpayer in certain circumstances,\nsubject to approval by the IRS through the ruling process or in published\nguidance, to establish that the reserve for such contracts is the amount\ntaken into account in determining the foreign statement reserve for the\ncontract (reduced by catastrophe, equalization, or deficiency reserve or\nany similar reserve).  IRS approval is to be based on whether the method,\nthe interest rate, the mortality and morbidity assumptions, and any other\nfactors taken into account in determining foreign statement reserves\n(taken together or separately) provide an appropriate means of measuring\nincome for Federal income tax purposes.  In seeking a ruling, the taxpayer\nis required to provide the IRS with necessary and appropriate information\nas to the method, interest rate, mortality and morbidity assumptions and\nother assumptions under the foreign reserve rules so that a comparison\ncan be made to the reserve amount determined by applying the tax\nreserve method that would apply if the qualifying insurance company were\n- 7 -\nsubject to tax under Subchapter L of the Code (with the modifications\nprovided under present law for purposes of these exceptions).  The IRS\nalso may issue published guidance indicating its approval.\nStaff of the Joint Comm. On Taxation, Technical Explanation of the \u201cJob Creation and\nWorker Assistance Act of 2002\" (JCX-12-02 (March 6, 2002)).\nAnalysis\nCFC1 and CFC2 are each subject to regulation as a life insurance company by Country\nA.  Each is licensed, authorized, and regulated by the Agency, which is the insurance\nregulatory body for Country A, to sell life insurance and annuity contracts to persons\nother than related persons (within the meaning of Code section 954(d)(3)) in Country A. \nCFC1 and CFC2 have each represented that it derives more than 50 percent of its\naggregate net written premiums from its issuance of life insurance and annuity\ncontracts covering risks in connection with the lives or health of residents of Country A\nand with respect to which no policyholder, insured, annuitant, or beneficiary is a related\nperson (as defined in Code section 954(d)(3)).  Finally, CFC1 and CFC2 are engaged in\nthe life insurance business and would be subject to tax under Subchapter L, if they\nwere domestic corporations.  Accordingly, CFC1 and CFC2 are QICs.\nCFC1 and CFC2 issue life insurance and annuity contracts in connection with the lives\nand health of residents of Country A, a country other than the U.S.  Moreover, CFC1\nand CFC2 each derive more than 30 percent of its net written premiums from contracts\nthat cover Country A risks with respect to which no policyholder, insured, annuitant or\nbeneficiary is a related person within the meaning of section 954(d)(3).  Such contracts\nare, therefore, exempt contracts within the meaning of section 953(e)(2).\nWe have determined that the underwriting reserves held by CFC1 and CFC2 for their\nexempt contracts that are life insurance or annuity contracts are foreign statement\nreserves within the meaning of Code section 954(i)(4)(B)(ii) for the following reasons:\n1.\nCFC1 and CFC2 must establish, maintain, and calculate their underwriting\nreserves in accordance with the insurance laws and regulations of Country A and\nguidance prescribed by the Agency.\n2.\nThe Agency generally requires a life insurance company to determine the\namount of its underwriting reserves under the NLP method.  However, the Agency\nallows CFC1 and CFC2 to calculate their underwriting reserves under the Zillmer\nMethod provided these companies also maintain special risk reserves for mortality and\ninvestment risk.  Each company\u2019s Zillmer reserve and special risk reserves are less\nthan the underwriting reserve that would need to be maintained if each company\ndetermined their reserves under the NLP method.\n3.\nCFC1 and CFC2 must set forth their underwriting reserves on the Annual\nReports, which must be filed annually with the Agency.  As such, these reserves are the\nmeasure of the legal obligations to contractholders on the financial statement used for\n- 8 -\nregulatory purposes by life insurance companies doing business in Country A generally\n(whether U.S.-owned, locally owned, or owned by companies headquartered in other\nforeign countries).\n4.\nThe Agency requires that CFC1 and CFC2 hold their underwriting reserves to\nenable them to fulfill claims owed to contractholders and their beneficiaries.\n5.\nUnder these circumstances, the underwriting and risk reserves are not\ncatastrophe, deficiency, equalization, or similar reserves.\nWe have also determined that the loss reserves held by CFC1 and CFC2 for their\nexempt contracts that are life insurance or annuity contracts are foreign statement\nreserves within the meaning of Code section 954(i)(4)(B)(ii) for the following reasons:\n1.\nCFC1 and CFC2 must establish, maintain and calculate loss reserves in\naccordance with the insurance laws and regulations of Country A and guidance issued\nby the Agency.\n2.\nCFC1 and CFC2 must set forth their loss reserves on the Annual Reports, which\nmust be filed annually with the Agency.  As such, they are the measure of the legal\nobligations to the contractholders on the financial statement used for regulatory\npurposes by life insurance companies doing business in Country A generally (whether\nU.S.-owned, locally owned, or owned by companies headquartered in other foreign\ncountries).\n3.\nThe Agency requires CFC1 and CFC2 to hold loss reserves for the fulfillment of\nthe claims of contractholders and their beneficiaries.\n4.\nCFC1's and CFC2's loss reserves are not catastrophe, deficiency, equalization,\nor similar reserves.\nFinally, we have determined that the policyholder dividend reserves held by CFC1 and\nCFC2 for their exempt contracts that are life insurance or annuity contracts are foreign\nstatement reserves within the meaning of Code section 954(i)(4)(B)(ii) for the following\nreasons:\n1.\nCFC1 and CFC2 must establish, maintain, and calculate their policyholder\ndividend reserves in accordance with the insurance laws and regulations of Country A\nand guidance issued by the Agency.  The genesis of the special policyholder dividend\nreserves for CFC2 is the result of a particular set of circumstances in Country A.\n2.\nSuch reserves are required to be, and are, set forth on the Annual Report that\nmust be filed annually with the Agency.  As such, they are the measure of the legal\nobligations to contractholders on the financial statement used for regulatory purposes\nby life insurance companies doing business in Country A generally (whether U.S.-\nowned, locally owned, or owned by companies headquartered in other foreign\ncountries).\n- 9 -\n3.\nThe Agency requires CFC1 and CFC2 to hold policyholders dividend reserves for\nthe fulfillment of the claims of contractholders and their beneficiaries.\n4.\nCFC1's and CFC2's policyholder dividend reserves are not catastrophe,\ndeficiency, equalization, or similar reserves.\nRulings\nBased on the information submitted and the representations made, we rule as follows:\n1.\nUnder the facts set forth above, the underwriting reserves (including risk\nreserves) of CFC1 and CFC2 for their exempt contracts that are life insurance or\nannuity contracts, as required to be calculated for purposes of the Annual Reports filed\nwith the Agency, are an appropriate means of measuring income within the meaning of\nsection 954(i)(4)(B)(ii) and, accordingly, the amount of these reserves may be used in\ndetermining each company\u2019s foreign personal holding company income under section\n954.\n2.\nThe loss reserves of CFC1 and CFC2 for their exempt contracts that are life\ninsurance or annuity contracts, as required to be calculated for purposes of the Annual\nReports filed with the Agency, are an appropriate means of measuring income within\nthe meaning of section 954(i)(4)(B)(ii) and, accordingly, the amount of these reserves\nmay be used in determining each company\u2019s foreign personal holding company income\nunder section 954.\n3.\nThe policyholder dividend reserves of CFC1 and CFC2 for their exempt contracts\nthat are life insurance or annuity contracts, as required to be calculated for purposes of\nthe Annual Reports filed with the Agency, are an appropriate means of measuring\nincome within the meaning of section 954(i)(4)(B)(ii) and, accordingly, the amount of\nthese reserves may be used in determining each company\u2019s foreign personal holding\ncompany income under section 954.\nCaveats\nWe express no opinion on any provisions of the Code or regulations not specifically\ncovered by the above rulings.  In particular, no opinion is expressed regarding whether\nthe IRS would determine if some or all of the risk reserves would constitute foreign\nstatement reserves within the meaning of Code section 954(i)(4)(B)(ii) in circumstances\nwhere such risk reserves cause total underwriting reserves to exceed the standard\nvaluation reserve using the reserve method prescribed by the Agency for such\ncontracts. In addition, our rulings are solely determinations that certain foreign reserves\nare an appropriate means of measuring income within the meaning of section\n954(i)(4)(B)(ii) and for no other purpose.\n- 10 -\nProcedural Statements\nThis ruling is directed only to Parent and certain of its subsidiaries.

------------:\nThis letter responds to your representative\u2019s letter dated March 19, 2012 in which \nyou requested rulings regarding certain Federal income tax consequences of a series of \nproposed transactions (the \u201cProposed Transactions\u201d).  The information submitted in that \nrequest and in later correspondence is summarized below.\nPLR-112185-12\n7\nThe rulings contained in this letter are based upon facts and representations \nsubmitted by the taxpayer and accompanied by a penalties of perjury statement \nexecuted by an appropriate party.  This office has not verified any of the material \nsubmitted in support of the request for rulings.  Verification of the information, \nrepresentations, and other data may be required as part of the audit process.  In \nparticular, this office has not reviewed any information pertaining to, and has made no \ndetermination regarding, whether either of the distributions described below: (i) satisfies \nthe business purpose requirement of \u00a7 1.355-2(b) of the Income Tax Regulations, (ii) is \nused principally as a device for the distribution of the earnings and profits of a \ndistributing corporation or a controlled corporation or both (see \u00a7 355(a)(1)(B) of the \nInternal Revenue Code, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d) and \u00a7 1.355-2(d)), or (iii) is part of a \nplan (or series of related transactions) pursuant to which one or more persons will \nacquire directly or indirectly stock representing a 50-percent or greater interest in a \ndistributing corporation or a controlled corporation (see \u00a7 355(e) and \u00a7 1.355-7).\nSummary of Facts\nDistributing 2, a State A corporation, is the common parent of an affiliated group \nof domestic corporations that files a consolidated U.S. Federal income tax return (the \n\u201cDistributing 2 Group\u201d).  The one class of Distributing 2 stock is owned a-percent by \nPship 1, a partnership for U.S. Federal tax purposes, and b-percent by Trusts and  \nmembers of Distributing 1 management.  Pship 1, which is controlled by the Sponsors,\nacquired its shares of Distributing 2 stock from the public on Date 1 and Date 2 in a \ntaxable stock purchase.  Distributing 2 is a holding company and has no assets other \nthan all of the outstanding Distributing 1 stock.  \nPrior to the Proposed Transactions, Distributing 1, a State B corporation, owned \nall the stock of Sub 1, a State B corporation; all of the interests in DRE 1, a State B \nlimited liability company disregarded as separate from Distributing 1 for Federal tax \npurposes under Treas. Reg. \u00a7 301.7701-3 (a \u201cdisregarded entity\u201d); all of the interests in \nDRE 2, a State C disregarded entity; and a c-percent interest in Sub 2, a State A \ncorporation.  The remaining interests in Sub 2 were owned within the Distributing 2\nGroup, including d-percent by DRE 1.  Distributing 1 also owned indirectly all of the \ninterests in DRE 3, a State B disregarded entity and sole owner of Sub 3, a State A \ncorporation.  \nSub 2 wholly owned FSub 1, a Country A corporation.  FSub 1 wholly owned \nFSub 2, a Country A corporation, and FDRE 1, a Country A disregarded entity.\nFSub 2 wholly owned the following disregarded entities: FDRE 2, FDRE 3, FDRE \n4, FDRE 5, and various other disregarded entities.   \nFDRE 2 wholly owned FSub 3, a Country B corporation; FSub 4, a Country C \ncorporation; FSub 5, a Country D corporation; FSub 6, a Country E corporation; FSub 7, \na Country F corporation; and FSub 8, a Country G corporation. \nPLR-112185-12\n8\nFSub 6 wholly owned FSub 9, a Country E corporation and sole owner of FSub \n10, a Country H corporation.  FSub 8 wholly owned FSub 11, a Country G corporation.\nFDRE 3 and FDRE 4 together wholly owned FPship 1, a Country H partnership \ntreated as a corporation for U.S. Federal tax purposes.  \nFDRE 1 wholly owned FSub 12, a Country A corporation.  FSub 12 wholly owned \nFSub 13, a Country I corporation.  FSub 13 has a note receivable from FSub 2 for \u20ace \n(the \u201cFSub 13 Receivable\u201d).\nDRE 1 wholly owned the following disregarded entities: DRE 4, FDRE 6, FDRE \n7, FDRE 8, FDRE 9, FDRE 10, and FDRE 11.  DRE 1 also owned f-percent of FSub 14, \na Country J corporation.  The remaining g-percent was owned by DRE 4.  FDRE 11 \nwholly owned FSub 15, a Country K corporation.  DRE 4 owned an h-percent interest in \nDRE 5, a State C limited liability company, and DRE 2 owned the remaining i-percent \ninterest.\nDistributing 2 and the members of its separate affiliated group (or \u201cSAG\u201d) as \ndefined in \u00a7 355(b)(3)(B) (the \u201cDistributing 2 SAG\u201d) are engaged in Business A and \nBusiness B.  The Distributing 2 SAG conducts Business A through Distributing 1, Sub 1,\nSub 3, DRE 3, FSub 2, FPship 1, and other entities owned directly or indirectly by these \ncorporations and disregarded entities.  Distributing 1 and the members of its SAG (the \n\u201cDistributing 1 SAG\u201d) conduct Business B through DRE 1, DRE 4, and FDRE 2.  FDRE \n2 owns the following entities that conduct Business B outside the United States:  FSub \n3, FSub 4, FSub 5, FSub 6, FSub 7, FSub 9, FSub 10, and FSub 11.\nFinancial information has been submitted indicating that Business A and \nBusiness B each has had gross receipts and operating expenses representing the \nactive conduct of a trade or business for each of the past five years.     \nBusiness A has operated under Brand Name A.  Business B has traditionally \noperated using Brand Name A in combination with Brand Name B.  Following the \nProposed Transactions, which will have the effect of separating Business B from \nBusiness A, Business B plans to use Brand Name B for certain purposes but to \ncontinue using Brand Name A in combination with Brand Name B for various \ncommercial applications.  Accordingly, Distributing 1 intends to grant the Controlled \nSAG a non-exclusive, worldwide, fully paid-up license to use Brand Name A in \ncombination with Brand Name B in connection with Business B (the \u201cBrand Name \nLicense\u201d).\nThe Proposed Transactions\nFor what are represented to be valid business purposes, Distributing proposes \nthe following steps which been partially consummated:\nPLR-112185-12\n9\n(i)\nOn Date 3, DRE 1 transferred its entire d-percent interest in Sub 2 to \nDistributing 1.\n(ii)\nOn Date 4, FDRE 2 formed FSub 16, a Country A holding company with an \ninitial capital contribution of \u20acj and elected to treat FSub 16 as a disregarded \nentity.\n(iii)\nOn Date 5, the following steps occurred in the order indicated:\n(a)\nFDRE 2 sold FSub 16 to DRE 1 for \u20acj.\n(b)\nDistributing 1 contributed $k to the capital of DRE 1 in the form of two \nDistributing 1 notes, one for $l (\u201cNote 1\u201d) and one for $m (\u201cNote 2\u201d).  \nDRE 1 then contributed the two notes to FSub 16. \n(c)\nFSub 8 sold FSub 11 to FSub 16 in exchange for Note 1. \n(d)\nFSub 3 and FSub 4 elected to be treated as disregarded entities. \n(e)\nFDRE 2 sold FSub 3, FSub 4, FSub 5, FSub 6 and subsidiaries, and \nFSub 7 to FSub 16 in exchange for Note 2. \n(f)\nDRE 1 contributed FDRE 6, FDRE 8, FDRE 9, and FDRE 10 (the \n\u201cBusiness B Foreign DREs\u201d) to FSub 16.  The following steps were \ntaken to transfer Note 2 to FDRE 1, Distributing 1\u2019s principal foreign \nholding company: (i) FDRE 2 distributed Note 2 to FSub 2; (ii) FSub 2 \ntransferred Note 2 to FSub 13 in partial satisfaction of the FSub 13 \nReceivable; (iii) FSub 13 distributed Note 2 to FSub 12; and (iv) FSub \n12 distributed Note 2 to FDRE 1. \n(iv)\nOn Date 6, DRE 4 transferred its interest in DRE 5 to DRE 2.\n(v)\nFSub 2 will sell certain assets of FDRE 5 to FDRE 11 in exchange for a note \nin the amount of $n-o (\u201cNote 3\u201d).  \n(vi)\nDRE 1 will contribute FDRE 11 to FSub 16.\n(vii) FSub 16 will elect to be treated as a regarded corporation for U.S. Federal \ntax purposes. \n(viii) The Business B Foreign DREs will elect to be treated as regarded \ncorporations for U.S. Federal tax purposes (together steps (i) through (viii) \ncomprise the \u201cPre-Tailoring Steps\u201d).  \n(ix)\nDistributing 1 will form Controlled.    \nPLR-112185-12\n10\n(x)\nDRE 1 will borrow $p from an unrelated third party (the \u201cNew Borrowing\u201d) \nand distribute the proceeds to Distributing 1.  Distributing 1 will use the \nproceeds to pay down existing Distributing 1 debt or for other corporate \npurposes.\n(xi)\nDistributing 1 will contribute DRE 1 and the Brand Name License to \nControlled in exchange for all of the Controlled stock and, as a result of the \ncontribution, the assumption by Controlled of liabilities related to Business B \n(including the New Borrowing) (the \u201cContribution\u201d).\n(xii) Distributing 1 will distribute the Controlled stock to Distributing 2 (the \n\u201cInternal Distribution\u201d).\n(xiii) Distributing 2 will distribute the Controlled stock to the Distributing 2 \nshareholders, pro rata (the \u201cExternal Distribution\u201d).   \nIn connection with the Proposed Transactions, the Distributing 2 Group and Controlled \nwill enter into a variety of agreements (collectively, the \u201cContinuing Agreements\u201d) \ninvolving transitional services (the \u201cTransition Services Agreements\u201d), contract\nmanufacturing services (the \u201cManufacturing Agreements,\u201d and together with the \nTransition Services Agreements, the \u201cTransitional Agreements\u201d), tax matters (the \u201cTax \nMatters Agreement\u201d), and other matters.  \nRepresentations\nThe Contribution and Internal Distribution\nDistributing 2 makes the following representations for the Contribution and \nInternal Distribution:  \n(a)\nAny indebtedness owed by Controlled (or any entity controlled directly or \nindirectly by Controlled) to Distributing 1 (or any entity controlled directly or \nindirectly by Distributing 1) after the Internal Distribution will not constitute \nstock or securities.\n(b)\nNo part of the consideration distributed by Distributing 1 in the Internal \nDistribution will be received by Distributing 2 as a creditor, employee, or in \nany capacity other than that of a shareholder of Distributing 1.\n(c)\nDistributing 1 and Controlled each will treat all members of its SAG (as \ndefined in section 355(b)(3)(B)) as one corporation in determining whether \nthe requirements of section 355(b)(2)(A) regarding the active conduct of a \ntrade or business are satisfied. \nPLR-112185-12\n11\n(d)\nThe five years of financial information submitted for Business A conducted \nby the Distributing 1 SAG and for Business B to be conducted by the \nControlled SAG following the Contribution is representative of the present \noperations of each business, and there have been no substantial \noperational changes in either business since the date of the last financial \nstatements submitted.\n(e)\nNeither Business A conducted by the Distributing 1 SAG nor control of an \nentity conducting this business will have been acquired during the five-year \nperiod ending on the date of the Internal Distribution in a transaction in \nwhich gain or loss was recognized (or treated as recognized) in whole or in \npart.  Throughout the five-year period ending on the date of the Internal \nDistribution, the Distributing 1 SAG will have been the principal owner of \nthe goodwill and significant assets of Business A, and the Distributing 1 \nSAG will continue to be the principal owner following the Internal \nDistribution.\n(f)\nNeither Business B conducted by the Controlled SAG (following the \nContribution) nor control of an entity conducting this business will have \nbeen acquired during the five-year period ending on the date of the Internal \nDistribution in a transaction in which gain or loss was recognized (or \ntreated as recognized) in whole or in part.  Throughout the five-year period \nending on the date of the Internal Distribution, Distributing 1 and its \nsubsidiaries (all members of the Distributing 1 SAG) will have been the \nprincipal owners of the goodwill and significant assets of Business B.  \nFollowing the Internal Distribution, Controlled and its subsidiaries (all \nmembers of the Controlled SAG following the Contribution) will be the \nprincipal owners.\n(g)\nApart from transitional and administrative support services that may be \nprovided under the Transition Services Agreements and contract \nmanufacturing services that may be provided under the Manufacturing \nAgreements, the Distributing 1 SAG will continue the active conduct of \nBusiness A, independently and with its separate employees, following the \nInternal Distribution.\n(h)\nApart from transitional and administrative support services that may be \nprovided under the Transition Services Agreements and contract \nmanufacturing services that may be provided under the Manufacturing \nAgreements, the Controlled SAG will continue the active conduct of \nBusiness B, independently and with its separate employees, following the \nInternal Distribution.\nPLR-112185-12\n12\n(i)\nThe Internal Distribution will be carried out to facilitate the External \nDistribution.  The Internal Distribution is motivated in whole or substantial \npart by this corporate business purpose.\n(j)\nThe Internal Distribution will not be used principally as a device for the \ndistribution of the earnings and profits of Distributing 1 or Controlled or \nboth.\n(k)\nFor purposes of section 355(d), immediately after the Internal Distribution, \nno person (determined after applying section 355(d)(7)) will hold stock \npossessing 50 percent or more of the total combined voting power of all \nclasses of Distributing 1 stock entitled to vote, or 50 percent or more of the \ntotal value of shares of all classes of Distributing 1 stock, that was acquired \nby purchase (as defined in section 355(d)(5) and (8)) during the five-year \nperiod (determined after applying section 355(d)(6)) ending on the date of \nthe Internal Distribution.\n(l)\nFor purposes of section 355(d), immediately after the Internal Distribution, \nno person (determined after applying section 355(d)(7)) will hold stock \npossessing 50 percent or more of the total combined voting power of all \nclasses of Controlled stock entitled to vote, or 50 percent or more of the \ntotal value of shares of all classes of Controlled stock, that was either (i) \nacquired by purchase (as defined in section 355(d)(5) and (8)) during the \nfive-year period (determined after applying section 355(d)(6)) ending on the \ndate of the Internal Distribution or (ii) attributable to distributions on \nDistributing 1 stock or securities that were acquired by purchase (as \ndefined in section 355(d)(5) and (8)) during the five-year period \n(determined after applying section 355(d)(6)) ending on the date of the \nInternal Distribution.\n(m)\nThe total adjusted basis of the assets transferred to Controlled in the \nContribution will equal or exceed the sum of (i) the total liabilities assumed \n(as determined under section 357(d)) by Controlled and (ii) the total \namount of any money and the fair market value of any other property \n(within the meaning of section 361(b)) received by Distributing 1 from \nControlled and transferred to Distributing 1\u2019s creditors in connection with \nthe reorganization. \n(n)\nAny liabilities assumed (as determined under section 357(d)) by Controlled \nin the Contribution will have been incurred in the ordinary course of \nbusiness and will be associated with the assets transferred. \n(o)\nThe total fair market value of the assets transferred to Controlled in the \nContribution will exceed the sum of (i) the amount of any liabilities assumed \n(as determined under section 357(d)) by Controlled in connection with the \nPLR-112185-12\n13\nContribution, (ii) the amount of any liabilities owed to Controlled by \nDistributing 1 that are discharged or extinguished in connection with the \nContribution, and (iii) the amount of any cash and the fair market value of \nany other property (other than stock and securities permitted to be received \nunder section 361(a) without the recognition of gain) received by \nDistributing 1 in connection with the Contribution.  The fair market value of \nthe assets of Controlled will exceed the amount of its liabilities immediately \nafter the Contribution.\n(p)\nThe aggregate fair market value of the assets Distributing 1 transfers to \nControlled in the Contribution will equal or exceed the aggregate adjusted \nbasis of those assets.\n(q)\nDistributing 1 will neither accumulate its receivables nor make \nextraordinary payment of its payables in anticipation of the Contribution \nand Internal Distribution.\n(r)\nApart from debt arising in connection with the Continuing Agreements, and \nintercompany loans or other obligations that have arisen, or will arise, in \nthe ordinary course of business, no intercorporate debt will exist between \nControlled (or any entity controlled directly or indirectly by Controlled) and \nDistributing 1 (or any entity controlled directly or indirectly by Distributing 1) \nat the time of, or after, the Internal Distribution.\n(s)\nImmediately before the Internal Distribution, items of income, gain, loss, \ndeduction, and credit will be taken into account as required by the \napplicable intercompany transaction regulations (see \u00a71.1502-13 and -14 \nas in effect before the publication of T.D. 8597, 1995-2 C.B. 147, and as \ncurrently in effect; \u00a7 1.1502-13 as published in T.D. 8597).  Further, any \nexcess loss account that Distributing 1 has in the Controlled stock or the \nstock of any direct or indirect subsidiary of Controlled will be included in \nincome immediately before the Internal Distribution to the extent required \nby regulations (see \u00a7 1.1502-19).  At the time of the Internal Distribution, \nDistributing 1 will not have an excess loss account in the stock of \nControlled or the stock of any direct or indirect subsidiary of Controlled.\n(t)\nApart from payments for certain services that may be rendered under the \nTransitional Agreements, payments made in connection with all continuing \ntransactions between Controlled (or any entity controlled directly or \nindirectly by Controlled) and Distributing 1 (or any entity controlled directly \nor indirectly by Distributing 1) will be for fair market value based on terms \nand conditions arrived at by the parties bargaining at arm\u2019s length.\n(u)\nNo two parties to the Internal Distribution are investment companies as \ndefined in section 368(a)(2)(F)(iii) and (iv).\nPLR-112185-12\n14\n(v)\nThe Internal Distribution is not part of a plan or series of related \ntransactions (within the meaning of Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.355-7) pursuant to \nwhich one or more persons will acquire directly or indirectly stock \nrepresenting a 50-percent or greater interest (within the meaning of section \n355(d)(4)) in Distributing 1 or Controlled (including any predecessor or \nsuccessor of either corporation).\n(w)\nImmediately after the transaction (as defined in section 355(g)(4)), (i) no \nperson will hold a 50-percent or greater interest (within the meaning of \nsection 355(g)(3)) in Distributing 1 or Controlled, (ii) if any person holds a \n50-percent or greater interest (within the meaning of section 355(g)(3)) in \nany disqualified investment corporation (within the meaning of section \n355(g)(2)), such person will have held such interest in such corporation \n(either directly or through attribution) immediately before the Internal \nDistribution, or (iii) neither Distributing 1 nor Controlled will be a disqualified \ninvestment corporation (within the meaning of section 355(g)(2)).\nThe External Distribution\nDistributing 2 makes the following representations for the External Distribution:\n(x)\nAny indebtedness owed by Controlled (or any entity controlled directly or \nindirectly by Controlled) to Distributing 2 (or any entity controlled directly or \nindirectly by Distributing 2) after the External Distribution will not constitute \nstock or securities.\n(y)\nNo part of the consideration distributed by Distributing 2 in the External \nDistribution will be received by a shareholder as a creditor, employee, or \nin any capacity other than that of a shareholder of Distributing 2.  \n(z)\nDistributing 2 and Controlled each will treat all members of its SAG (as \ndefined in section 355(b)(3)(B)) as one corporation in determining whether \nthe requirements of section 355(b)(2)(A) regarding the active conduct of a \ntrade or business are satisfied. \n(aa)\nThe five years of financial information submitted for Business A conducted \nby the Distributing 2 SAG (through Distributing 1) and for Business B \nconducted by the Controlled SAG is representative of the present\noperations of each business, and there have been no substantial \noperational changes in either business since the date of the last financial \nstatements submitted.\n(bb)\nNeither Business A conducted by the Distributing 2 SAG (through \nDistributing 1) nor control of an entity conducting this business will have \nbeen acquired during the five-year period ending on the date of the \nPLR-112185-12\n15\nExternal Distribution in a transaction in which gain or loss was recognized \n(or treated as recognized) in whole or in part.  Throughout the five-year \nperiod ending on the date of the External Distribution, the Distributing 2 \nSAG will have been the principal owner of the goodwill and significant \nassets of Business A and will continue to be the principal owner following \nthe External Distribution.\n(cc)\nNeither Business B conducted by the Controlled SAG nor control of an \nentity conducting this business will have been acquired during the five-\nyear period ending on the date of the External Distribution in a transaction \nin which gain or loss was recognized (or treated as recognized) in whole \nor in part.  Throughout the five-year period ending on the date of the \nInternal Distribution, Distributing 1 and its subsidiaries (all members of the \nDistributing 1 SAG and the Distributing 2 SAG) will have been the principal \nowners of the goodwill and significant assets of Business B.

Specifically, Taxpayer requested a \ndetermination that the cost of Product is an expense for medical care under \u00a7 213(d). \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPLR-112051-21 \n \n2 \nFACTS \n \n \nThe Internal Revenue Service received Taxpayer\u2019s request relating to Taxable \nYear on Date 2.  Taxpayer and Taxpayer\u2019s spouse filed a joint federal income tax \nreturn for Taxable Year on Date 3.  \n \n \n \n \nTaxpayer is on the cash method of accounting and has a calendar taxable year . \n \n \nTaxpayer purchased Product during Taxable Year for Taxpayer\u2019s infant, who, at \nthe time, was five months old and qualified as Taxpayer\u2019s dependent (as defined under  \n\u00a7 152, determined without regard to subsections (b)(1), (b)(2), and (d)(1)(B) thereof).  \nProduct is neither medicine nor a drug but rather food.  Product may be purchased on \nProduct manufacturer\u2019s website and at retail stores.   \n \n \nTaxpayer represents that Product is specifically formulated to be safe for an \ninfant\u2019s consumption while providing the infant with a specific amount of X.  Taxpayer \nrepresents that the early introduction of X, through consumption of Product, reduces \nthe risk of W in the future for the infant.  Taxpayer purchased Product upon the \nrecommendation of the infant\u2019s doctor though Product may be purchased without a \ndoctor\u2019s prescription.  When Taxpayer purchased Product, the infant had no known \nillness caused by W nor an imminent probability of one. \n  \n \nTaxpayer did not deduct the cost of Product on Taxpayer\u2019s joint federal income \ntax return for Taxable Year. \n \n \n \nWe advised Taxpayer\u2019s authorized representative that we were tentatively \nadverse to the ruling request.  On Date 4, we held a conference of right with \nTaxpayer\u2019s representative.  On Date 5, Taxpayer submitted post-adverse conference \nwritten information.  On Date 6, Taxpayer submitted additional written information.  On \nDate 7, we reaffirmed our adverse determination to Taxpayer\u2019s authorized \nrepresentative.  Taxpayer\u2019s representative informed us that Taxpayer wants an \nadverse ruling letter.  \n \nRULING REQUESTED \n \nTaxpayer requests a ruling that the cost of Product is an expense for medical \ncare under \u00a7 213 of the Code. \n   \nLAW AND ANALYSIS \n   \n \nSection 262(a) provides that except as otherwise provided, no deduction shall \nbe allowed for personal, family, or living expenses.  Thus, food is ordinarily a personal \nexpense and nondeductible by virtue of \u00a7 262.  Section 213 does not recharacterize \nmedical expenses as nonpersonal; it merely carves out a limited exception from \u00a7 262 \nfor those expenses which fall within its exception.  Thus. \u00a7\u00a7 262 and 213 must be read \n \n \nPLR-112051-21 \n \n3 \nin conjunction to determine the deductibility of any medical expense, particularly when \nthe expense relates to food.    \n \n \nSection 213 (a) allows a taxpayer to deduct expenses paid for medical care \nduring the calendar year of the taxpayer, his spouse, or a dependent (as defined under  \n\u00a7 152, determined without regard to subsections (b)(1), (b)(2), and (d)(1)(B) thereof) \nsubject to the adjusted gross income percentage for the taxable year.  \n  \n \n \nSection 213 (d)(1)(A) provides that medical care includes amounts paid for the \ndiagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, or for the purpose of \naffecting any structure or function of the body.  The medical expense deduction has  \nhistorically been construed narrowly.  Atkinson v. Commissioner, 44 T.C. 39, 49 \n(1965).  Deductions for medical care have been confined strictly to expenses incurred \nprimarily for the prevention or alleviation of a physical or mental defect or illness.   \nSection 1.213-1(e)(1)(ii) of the Income Tax Regulations.  \n \n \nRevenue Ruling 55-261, 1955-1 C.B. 307, holds, in part, that generally, the cost \nof special food does not qualify as a medical expense.  However, in special cases, \ndepending upon the particular facts presented, if the prescribed food is taken solely for \nthe alleviation or treatment of an illness, is in no way a part of the nutritional needs of \nthe patient, and a statement as to the particular facts and to the food prescribed is \nsubmitted by a physician, the cost of such food may be deducted as a medical \nexpense.  Revenue Ruing 55-261 does not support a favorable ruling on Taxpayer\u2019s \nfacts because the infant did not have an illness, and the Product has nutritional value \napart from its represented benefits in preventing W.   \n \nRevenue. Ruling 55-261 is in accord with the case law addressing food as a \nmedical expense.  The Tax Court has held that the additional costs of obtaining \nmedically required foods that alleviate an existing medical condition are deductible as \nexpenditures for medical care.  Randolph v. Commissioner, 67 T.C. 481, 488 (1976) \n(citing Cohen v. Commissioner, 88 T.C. 387 (1962)); Von Kalb v. Commissioner, T.C. \nMemo.1978\u2013366, acq. in result only, 1979-66 (Feb. 27, 1979).  However, the costs of \nfoods that meet the normal dietary needs of an individual are not deductible medical \nexpenses.  Harris v. Commissioner, 46 T.C. 672, 673 (1966); Estate of Webb v. \nCommissioner, 30 T.C. 1202, 1213\u20131214 (1958); Massa v. Commissioner, T.C. Memo \n1999-63, aff\u2019d without published opinion 208 F. 3d 226 (10th Cir. 2000); Collins v. \nCommissioner, T.C. Memo.1965\u2013233.  See also, Rev. Rul. 2002-19, 2002-16 I.R.B. \n778 (individuals participating in a weight loss program may not deduct the cost of \npurchasing reduced-calorie diet food because the foods are substitutes for the foods \nthe individual would normally consume to satisfy nutritional requirements).  Revenue \nRuling. 2002-19 cites to, and restates, the holding of Rev. Rul. 55-261. \n \n \nIn cases holding that the cost of a special diet is deductible under \u00a7 213, the \ndeductible amount is limited to the excess of the cost of the special diet over the cost of \na normal diet.  Nehus v. Commissioner, T.C. Memo.1994\u2013631, aff\u2019d. without published \nopinion 108 F.3d 338 (9th Cir.1997); Crawford v. Commissioner, T.C. Memo.1993-192.  \n \n \nPLR-112051-21 \n \n4 \nSpecifically, the excess cost of specially prepared foods designed to treat a medical \ncondition over the cost of ordinary foods which would have been consumed but for the \ncondition is an expense for medical care.  Randolph, 67 T.C. at 489; Cohn v. \nCommissioner, 38 T.C. 387, 391 (1962); Von Kalb v. Commissioner, T.C. Memo. 1978-\n366.  A taxpayer must prove what the taxpayer spent for the special diet and what the \ntaxpayer would spend for food to satisfy normal nutritional needs.  Flemming v. \nCommissioner, T.C. Memo. 1980-583. \n \nCONCLUSION \n \n \nBased on the facts and representations submitted, we conclude the cost of \nProduct is not an expense for medical care under \u00a7 213 of the Code. \n \n \n \nThe ruling contained in this letter is based on information and representations \nsubmitted by Taxpayer and accompanied by a penalty of perjury statement executed \nby an appropriate party.

While this office has not verified any of the material \nsubmitted in support of the request for rulings, it is subject to verification on \nexamination. \n \n2 \n \n \n \nTaxpayer worked in Country A in 1997, and she excluded her foreign earned \nincome under section 911.  Due to the high rate of tax in Country A in comparison to the \nU.S. tax rate, Taxpayer revoked her section 911 foreign earned income election on her \n1998 federal income tax return by taking a credit for the amount of the foreign taxes \npaid.  Taxpayer represents that she has not taken foreign tax credits attributable to \nincome excluded under section 911 and applied them to income earned in 1998 or \nsubsequent taxable years.  \n \nOn or about August 14, 2002, Taxpayer moved to Country B and began \nemployment with a new employer, Bank Y.  Bank Y is an international organization, of \nwhich the U.S. is a member.  As such, Taxpayer has diplomatic status and pays no \nincome tax to Country B.  The U.S. owns C percent share of the capital and holds D \npercent of the voting power of Bank Y. Taxpayer wants to reelect the section 911 \nforeign earned income exclusion for tax year 2002 and subsequent tax years.    \n \n \nTreas. Reg. \u00a71.911-7(b) provides that if an individual revoked an election to \nexclude foreign earned income under section 911(a) and within five taxable years the \nindividual wishes to reelect the exclusion, then the individual may apply for consent to \nthe reelection by requesting a ruling from the Associate Chief Counsel (International).  \nIn determining whether to consent to a reelection, the Associate Chief Counsel \n(International) or his delegate may consider any facts and circumstances relevant to the \ndetermination.  Relevant facts and circumstances may include a move from one foreign \ncountry to another foreign country with differing tax rates, and a change of employer. \n \n \nAccordingly, based solely on the information and representations set forth above, \nit is held that Taxpayer may reelect the section 911 foreign earned income exclusion for \ntax year 2002 and subsequent tax years.  \n \n \nNo opinion is expressed as to whether Taxpayer satisfied the requirements for \nthe exclusion provided under section 911(a) of the Code.  In particular, no opinion is \nexpressed about whether Taxpayer is employed by the U.S. government and thus, is \nnot eligible to exclude her salary under section 911. \n \n \nA copy of this ruling letter should be attached to Taxpayer\u2019s federal income tax \nreturn for the relevant year. \n \n \nA copy of this letter is being sent to the Taxpayer\u2019s authorized representative. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n3 \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThis ruling is directed only to the taxpayer who requested it.

While this office has not verified any of the material submitted\nin support of the request for ruling, it is subject to verification on examination.  The\ninformation submitted for consideration is substantially as set forth below.\nA, a long-term resident of the United States within the meaning of section 877(e),\nrelinquished his U.S. lawful permanent resident status (\"expatriated\") on Date C by\nreturning his green card to the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service.  A has\nbeen a citizen of Country D during his entire life by reason of his birth on Date E in\nCountry D.  A and his parents were born in Country D.  A became a permanent resident\nof the United States and obtained his green card in Year F.  On the date of A\u2019s\nexpatriation, his net worth exceeded the threshold required under section 877(a)(2).\nSection 877 generally provides that a citizen who loses U.S. citizenship or a U.S.\nlong-term resident who ceases to be taxed as a lawful permanent resident (individuals\nwho \"expatriate\") within the 10-year period immediately preceding the close of the\ntaxable year will be taxed under section 877(b) and section 877(d) for such taxable\nPLR-157756-01\nPage 2\nyear, unless such loss did not have for one of its principal purposes the avoidance of\nU.S. taxes.  Sections 2107 and 2501(a)(3) provide special estate and gift tax regimes,\nrespectively, for individuals who expatriate with a principal purpose to avoid U.S. taxes.\nA former citizen or former long-term resident will be treated as having expatriated\nwith a principal purpose to avoid U.S. taxes for purposes of sections 877, 2107, and\n2501(a)(3) if the individual\u2019s average income tax liability or the individual\u2019s net worth on\nthe date of expatriation exceeds certain thresholds.  See sections 877(a)(2),\n2107(a)(2)(A), and 2501(a)(3)(B). \nUnder Notice 98-34, 1998-2 C.B. 29, modifying Notice 97-19, 1997-1 C.B. 394, a\nformer U.S. citizen or former long-term resident whose net worth or average tax liability\nexceeds the applicable threshold will not be presumed to have a principal purpose of\ntax avoidance if that former citizen or resident is described within certain categories and\nsubmits a complete and good faith request for a ruling as to whether such loss had for\none of its principal purposes the avoidance of U.S. taxes.  A is eligible to request a\nruling pursuant to Notice 98-34 because on the date of expatriation, A was a resident\nand fully liable to income tax in Country D, the country where A was born. \nNotice 98-34 requires that certain information be submitted with a request for a\nruling that an individual\u2019s expatriation did not have for one of its principal purposes the\navoidance of U.S. taxes.  A submitted all the information required by Notice 98-34,\nincluding any additional information requested by the Service after review of the\nsubmission.\nBased solely on the information submitted and the representations made, we\nconclude that A has made a complete and good faith submission in accordance with\nsection 877(c)(1)(B) and Notice 98-34.  Therefore, A will not be presumed under\nsection 877(a)(2) to have as one of his principal purposes for expatriating the avoidance\nof U.S. taxes.\nHowever, because the information submitted does not clearly establish either the\nexistence or lack of a principal purpose to avoid taxes under subtitle A or B of the Code,\nno opinion is expressed as to whether A\u2019s expatriation had for one of its principal\npurposes the avoidance of such taxes.  While this ruling rebuts the presumption of tax\navoidance under section 877(a)(2), it is not conclusive as to whether A subsequently\nmay be found to have a principal purpose of tax avoidance under sections 877(a)(1),\n2107(a)(1), and 2501(a)(3)(A) based on all the facts and circumstances.  See section\n877(c)(1).\nExcept as expressly provided herein, no opinion is expressed or implied\nconcerning the tax consequences of any aspect of any transaction or item discussed or\nreferenced in this letter.  In addition, no opinion is expressed as to A\u2019s U.S. tax liability\nfor taxable periods prior to his loss of permanent residence status or for taxable periods\nafter his loss of permanent residence status under sections of the Code other than\nsections 877, 2107, and 2501(a)(3).\nPLR-157756-01\nPage 3\nA copy of this letter must be attached to A\u2019s U.S. income tax return for the year in\nwhich A obtained the ruling.\nThis ruling is directed only to the taxpayer requesting it.  Section 6110(k)(3) of\nthe Code provides that it may not be used or cited as precedent.\nIn accordance with the power of attorney on file with this office, a copy of this\nletter is being sent to A\u2019s representative.  \nSincerely yours,\nW.

The material information submitted for consideration is\nsummarized below.\nAcquiring, a State X corporation, is the common parent of an affiliated group of\ncorporations filing a consolidated return.  Acquiring has a 52/53 week fiscal year ending\non the first Saturday in November year end and uses the accrual method of accounting. \nAcquiring has outstanding a single class of common stock which is publicly traded on\nMarket.  Acquiring is engaged in Business Y.\nDisregarded Entity is a newly formed, State X limited liability company that is\nwholly-owned by Acquiring.  Disregarded Entity is treated as a disregarded entity for\nFederal tax purposes.  Disregarded Entity has been organized for the sole purpose of\neffecting the proposed transaction.\nTarget, a State X corporation, is the common parent of an affiliated group of\ncorporations filing a consolidated return.  Target has a calendar year end and uses the\naccrual method of accounting.  Target has outstanding a single class of common stock\nwhich is publicly traded on Market.  Target is engaged in Business Z.\nFor what are represented as valid business reasons, Acquiring and Target have\nproposed the following transaction: \nUnder State X General Corporation Law and the State X Limited Liability\nCompany Act, Target will be merged with and into Disregarded Entity, with\nDisregarded Entity surviving (the \u201cMerger\u201d).  Disregarded Entity will acquire all of\nthe assets and assume all of the liabilities of Target.  Target shareholders will be\nentitled to receive a% of a share of Acquiring common stock in exchange for\n3\nPLR-168503-01\neach share of Target common stock.  Target shareholders will receive cash in\nlieu of fractional shares.\nThe following representations have been made in connection with the proposed\ntransactions.  For purposes of these representations and the following rulings, the\nfollowing terms are defined:\nAcquiring Unit \n=\nAcquiring, and all of the business entities\nwhose assets are treated as Acquiring\u2019s for\nFederal tax purposes.\nTarget Unit\n=\nTarget, and all of the business entities whose\nassets are treated as Target\u2019s for Federal tax\npurposes.\na.\nThe fair market value of Acquiring stock and other consideration, if any,\nreceived by each Target shareholder will be approximately equal to the\nfair market value of the shares of Target stock surrendered in the\nexchange.\nb.\nAt least 50% of the proprietary interest in Target will be exchanged for\nstock of Acquiring and will have been preserved within the meaning of\nTreas. Reg. section 1.368-1(e).\nc.\nIn connection with the potential reorganization, neither Acquiring Unit, nor\nany person related to Acquiring Unit (within the meaning of Treas. Reg.\nsection 1.368-1(e)(3)) has any plan or intention to reacquire any Acquiring\nstock issued in the transaction in exchange for any consideration other\nthan Acquiring stock.\nd.\nAcquiring Unit does not have any plan or intention to sell or otherwise\ndispose of any of the assets of Target Unit acquired in the transaction,\nexcept for dispositions made in the ordinary course of business or\ntransfers described in section 368(a)(2)(C) of the Code or described in\nTreas.

You submitted additional information in letters dated February 28,\nFebruary 29, March 2 and June 12, 2000.  The information submitted in the request and\nin subsequent correspondence is summarized below.\nTaxpayer was organized under state law and was wholly owned by Tribe A, a\nFederally-recognized Indian tribe.  Taxpayer owned Business B and conducted\nBusiness B operations off-reservation.  On Date 1, Tribe A established a corporation\norganized under section 17 of the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934, 25 U.S.C. section\n477 (1993) (the IRA) and merged Taxpayer into this new corporation (Newco) with the\nintention of then selling all of Taxpayer\u2019s operating assets to a third party.  Although the\ncontemplated sale was subsequently canceled, the sale of the operating assets of\nNewco remains an option under consideration.  \nPLR-101675-00\n2\nIn its ruling request, Taxpayer argues that Revenue Rulings 94-16, 1994-1 C.B.\n19 and 94-65, 1994-2 C.B. 14, allow for the reorganization of a state-chartered Indian\nowned corporation into a federally-chartered corporation, as described above, in a tax-\nfree manner and requested rulings to that effect.\nRevenue Ruling 67-284, 1967-2 C.B. 55, 58, modified on another issue by Rev.\nRul. 74-13, 1974-1 C.B. 14, holds that Indian tribes are not taxable entities.  Revenue\nRuling 81-295, 1981-2 C.B. 15, relying on Mescalero Apache Tribe v. Jones, 411 U.S.\n145, 157, n. 13 (1973), holds that an Indian tribal corporation organized under section\n17 of the IRA shares the same tax status as the Indian tribe and is not taxable on\nincome from activities carried on within the boundaries of the reservation.  Revenue\nRuling     94-16 clarified Rev. Rul. 81-295 by holding that a section 17 corporation is not\nsubject to Federal income tax on the income earned from the conduct of a commercial\nbusiness either on or off the tribe\u2019s reservation.  This is not true for state-chartered tribal\ncorporations, which are subject to Federal income tax on income earned from\ncommercial activities.  \nHowever, Rev. Rul. 94-16 provides retroactive relief for income earned before\nOctober 1, 1994 by a state-chartered corporation from activities conducted within the\nboundaries of the reservation (including gain and loss properly allocable to such\nactivities from the sale or exchange of assets) if that corporation converts into a\nfederally-chartered corporation under section 17 of the IRA.  Revenue Ruling 94-65\namplifies Rev. Rul. 94-16 and, in pertinent part, extends the conversion period under\ncertain circumstances, not applicable in this case.   \n \nBased on the facts and representations presented by the Taxpayer, we\ndetermined that Taxpayer\u2019s off-reservation business activities are not entitled to relief\nfrom Federal income tax pursuant to either Rev. Rul. 94-16 or Rev. Rul. 94-65. \nTaxpayer now concedes and represents that its merger into Newco does not\nqualify for relief under Rev. Ruls. 94-16 or 94-65, and therefore, Taxpayer\u2019s merger into\nNewco is a taxable event.  \nWe express no opinion about the tax treatment of the transaction under other\nprovisions of the Code and regulations or about the tax treatment of any conditions\nexisting at the time of, or effects resulting from, the transaction that are not specifically\ncovered by the above ruling.   Specifically, no opinion is expressed whether the\ntransaction is taxable under \u00a7337(d) of the Internal Revenue Code, in the event that the\ntransaction qualifies as a reorganization under \u00a7368, or under \u00a71001. \nThe rulings contained in this letter are based on the facts and representations\nsubmitted under penalties of perjury in support of the request for rulings.  Verification of\nthis information may be required as part of the audit process.\nPLR-101675-00\n3\nThis ruling is directed only to the taxpayer who requested it.  Section 6110(k)(3)\nprovides that it may not be used or cited as precedent.\nEach taxpayer involved in the transaction covered by this letter should attach a\ncopy of the letter to its Federal income tax return for the taxable year in which the\ntransaction is consummated.\nUnder a power of attorney on file in this office, a copy of this letter is being sent\nto the Taxpayer\u2019s authorized representative.\nSincerely yours,\nAssociate Chief Counsel (Corporate)\nBy _\n                \nFiliz A.

A ruling is sought concerning the validity of a reverse\n2\nPLR-119805-99\nQTIP election under section 2652(b)(3)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code.  In addition, a\nruling is sought that, if a determination is made that the reverse QTIP election with\nrespect to Trust 2 is valid, the automatic allocation of the generation-skipping transfer\n(\u201cGST\u201d) tax exemption set forth in \u00a7 2632(c) applies so that Trust 2 will have an\ninclusion ratio of 0.00.  This letter responds to those requests.\nOn Date 1, Decedent and Spouse created Trust 1.  The last complete\namendment and restatement (\u201cRestatement\u201d) of Trust 1 was executed on Date 2. \nFollowing the Restatement, Decedent and Spouse amended Trust 1 three additional\ntimes.  The third amendment (\u201cAmendment\u201d), dated Date 3, revoked the previous two\namendments in their entirety.  Decedent died on Date 4.  Accordingly, upon Decedent\u2019s\ndeath, the terms of Trust 1 were governed by the Date 2 Restatement and the Date 3\nAmendment.\nIn accordance with State law and Paragraphs B and C of Article III of the\nRestatement, all property in Trust 1 was community property of Decedent and Spouse\nat the time of Decedent\u2019s death.  Article V, Paragraph A, Subparagraph 3 states that\nupon the satisfaction of all claims, expenses and taxes resulting from the Decedent\u2019s\ndeath, Trust 1 shall be divided into two separate trusts (one consisting of Decedent\u2019s\ncommunity property share and one consisting of Spouse\u2019s community property share)\npursuant to the provisions of Paragraph C of the same Article.  Article V, Paragraph C,\nSubparagraph 1 provides for the creation of a trust that consists of Decedent\u2019s one-half\ninterest in the community property in Trust 1.  The subparagraph further directs the\ntrustee to divide the property allocated into the new trust into two separate shares to be\nheld in separate trusts as described in Subparagraphs 1(a) and 1(b) of Article V,\nParagraph C.  Subparagraph 1(a) of Article V, Paragraph C creates Trust 2, the subject\nof this private letter ruling.  Under that subparagraph, Trust 2 is to be funded with an\namount of property equal in value to the Decedent\u2019s remaining GST exemption.  \nSubparagraph 1(b) of Article V, Paragraph C provides for a second trust to be funded\nwith the portion of the one-half interest which was not allocated by Subparagraph 1(a). \nBecause the value of Decedent\u2019s assets did not exceed his remaining GST exemption,\nthe trust described in Subparagraph 1(b) of Article V, Paragraph C was not funded. \nFinally, Article V, Paragraph C, Subparagraph 2 provides for the creation of a trust that\nconsists of Spouse\u2019s one-half interest in the community property in Trust 1 (\u201cTrust 3\"). \nTrust 3 will continue to be administered under the provisions in Article VIII during\nSpouse\u2019s lifetime.\nArticle VI provides for the administration and distribution of Trust 2.  Paragraph A\nof Article VI directs the executor to make a QTIP election under \u00a7 2056(b)(7)(B)(v).  In\naddition, Paragraph B of Article VI directs the executor to make a reverse QTIP election\nunder \u00a7\u00a7 2631 and 2652(a)(3).\nThe Decedent\u2019s estate tax return was due on Date 5.  A timely filed estate tax\nreturn was not filed and no extensions were requested or granted.  An estate tax return\n3\nPLR-119805-99\nwas filed on Date 6.  The return constitutes the first return filed after the due date.  Both\na QTIP election and a reverse QTIP election were made on the return.  You are\nrequesting a ruling regarding the validity of the reverse QTIP election made on the\nreturn.  \nSection 2001(a) imposes a tax on the transfer of the taxable estate of every\ndecedent who is a citizen or resident of the United States.  \nSection 2056(a) provides that, for purposes of the tax imposed by \u00a7 2001, the\nvalue of the taxable estate is to be determined by deducting from the value of the gross\nestate an amount equal to the value of any interest in property that passes or has\npassed from the decedent to the surviving spouse.\nSection 2056(b)(1) provides the general rule that no deduction shall be allowed\nfor an interest passing to the surviving spouse if, on the lapse of time, on the\noccurrence of an event or contingency, or on the failure of an event or contingency to\noccur, the interest will terminate or fail.\nSection 2056(b)(7)(A) provides that, in the case of qualified terminable interest\nproperty (QTIP), the entire property shall be treated as passing to the surviving spouse\nfor purposes of \u00a7 2056(a) and no part of the property shall be treated as passing to any\nperson other than the surviving spouse for purposes of \u00a7 2056(b)(1)(A).\nSection 2056(b)(7)(B)(i) defines \u201cqualified terminable interest property\u201d as\nproperty: (1) which passes from the decedent, (2) in which the surviving spouse has a\nqualifying income interest for life, and (3) to which an election under \u00a7 2056(b)(7)(B)(v)\napplies.\nSection 20.2056(b)-7(b)(4) of the Estate Tax Regulations provides that the QTIP\nelection is made on the last filed estate tax return on or before the due date of the\nreturn, including extensions, or, if a timely return is not filed, the first estate tax return\nfiled after the due date.\nIt follows that the QTIP election made on the return is a timely QTIP election and\nvalid insofar as it is timely.\nSection 2601 imposes a tax on every generation-skipping transfer.\nSection 2631(a) provides that for purposes of determining the inclusion ratio,\nevery individual shall be allowed a GST exemption of $1,000,000 which may be\nallocated by such individual (or his executor) to any property with respect to which such\nindividual is the transferor.\nSection 2652(a)(3) provides that in the case of any trust with respect to which a\n4\nPLR-119805-99\ndeduction is allowed to the decedent\u2019s estate under \u00a7 2056(b)(7), the estate of the\ndecedent may elect to treat all of the property in the trust, for purposes of the GST tax,\nas if the election to be treated as QTIP had not been made.  This election is referred to\nas the \u201creverse\u201d QTIP election.  The consequence of a reverse QTIP election is that the\ndecedent remains, for GST tax purposes, the transferor of the QTIP trust for which the\nelection is made.  As a result, the decedent\u2019s GST exemption may be allocated to the\nQTIP trust.\nSection 26.2652-2(b) provides that the reverse QTIP election is to be made on\nthe return on which the QTIP election is made.  \nBased on the information submitted and the representations made, the reverse\nQTIP election made on the return is timely because it was made on the same return on\nwhich the timely QTIP election was made.\nUnder \u00a7 2632(a), an allocation of the GST exemption may be made at any time\non or before the date prescribed for filing the individual\u2019s estate tax return (including\nextensions).  Under \u00a7 2632(c), any portion of an individual GST exemption not allocated\nwithin the time prescribed in \u00a7 2632(a), is allocated automatically.\nSection 26.2632-1(d)(2) of the Generation-Skipping Transfer Tax Regulations\nsupplies the method for the automatic allocation of any unused GST exemption.  First,\nthe exemption is allocated pro rata to direct skips on the basis of the value of property\nas finally determined for purposes of Chapter 11.  The balance is then allocated pro\nrata, on the basis of value, to trusts with respect to which a taxable termination may\noccur or from which a taxable distribution may be made.  In the case of trusts that are\nnot included in the gross estate, the GST exemption is allocated on the basis of the\ndate of death value of the trust.  No automatic allocation is made to a trust that will have\na new transferor with respect to the entire trust prior to the occurrence of any GST with\nrespect to the trust.  The automatic allocation is irrevocable.\nBecause the return was not timely filed, the Decedent\u2019s remaining GST\nexemption is allocated automatically in accordance with \u00a7 2632(c) of the Code and\n\u00a7 26.2632-1(d)(2) of the regulations.  The exemption will be allocated pro rata to direct\nskips on the basis of the value of property.  The balance will be allocated pro rata, on\nthe basis of value, to trusts with respect to which a taxable termination may occur or\nfrom which a taxable distribution may be made. \nFurthermore, because the reverse QTIP election is valid insofar as it is timely,\nDecedent remains the transferor of Trust 2 for purposes of the automatic allocation of\nthe GST exemption.  According to your representations, Decedent\u2019s GST exemption\nexceeds the value of transfers with GST potential, both his lifetime and testamentary\ntransfers including Trust 2.  Therefore, the inclusion ratio of Trust 2 is 0.00.\n5\nPLR-119805-99\nExcept as specifically ruled herein, we express or imply no opinion on the federal\ntax consequences of the transaction under the cited provisions or under any other\nprovisions of the Code.  \nThis ruling is directed only to the taxpayer who requested it.

Trustees were named as trustees of the \n2\nPLR-118835-99\ntrust.  Under the terms of Trust, the trustee is required to distribute trust income \nannually to a class of beneficiaries consisting of the Settlors\u2019 living issue (but excluding \ntheir children).  Each member of the class has a noncumulative power to withdraw their \nshare of any contributions to the trust.  The trustee also has the discretion to distribute \ncorpus to a member of the class to provide for the beneficiary\u2019s health, education, \nsupport, and maintenance.  If a member of the class dies survived by issue, the \nsurviving issue become members of the class.  Trust will terminate on the later of the \ndeath of the last surviving Settlor, or when the number of class members equals 40.  In \nno event may any trust established under the Trust instrument extend beyond the \napplicable rule against perpetuities.  Upon termination, the corpus will be divided into as \nmany equal shares as there are then living children of the Settlors and deceased \nchildren of the Settlors who have left issue then surviving.  \nEach share created on account of a living or deceased child of the Settlors shall \nbe further divided into as many equal shares as there are then living children of the said \nchild and deceased grandchildren who have left issue then surviving.  Each share \ncreated for a grandchild that is age 35 at termination will be distributed outright.  If a \ngrandchild is not age 35, then the share will continue in trust for the grandchild.  If a \ndeceased grandchild is survived by issue, then the grandchild\u2019s share is to be \ndistributed outright, per stirpes. \nThe terms of the Trust specifically preclude either Settlor from acting as trustee.  \nFurther, the Settlors have retained no powers or authority over the Trust, Trust property, \nor the administration of the Trust.\nThe Trust has purchased a second-to-die life insurance policy on the lives of \nSettlor A and Settlor B and proposes to entered into a split-dollar life insurance \nagreement (Agreement) with Settlors.  Under the agreement, the Trust will continue to \nown the policy and will pay during the joint lives of the Settlors an amount equal to the \ninsurance company\u2019s current published premium rate for annually renewable term \ninsurance generally available for standard risks.  After the death of the first Settlor, the \nTrust will pay an amount equal to the lesser of: (1) the applicable amount provided in \nNotice 2001-10, 2001-1 C.B. 549, or subsequent IRS guidance; or (2) the insurer\u2019s \ncurrent published premium rate for annually renewable term insurance generally \navailable for standard risks.  The Settlors will pay the balance of the premiums.\nUnder the Agreement, the Trust will collaterally assign the following rights to the \nSettlors: (1) if the Agreement terminates on the death of the survivor of Settlor A and \nSettlor B, then upon the death of the survivor, the right of the survivor\u2019s estate to receive \nthe greater of the cash surrender value of the policy or the cumulative premiums paid by \nthe Settlors; and (2) if the Agreement terminates during the lifetime of Settlor A and \nSettlor B, or the lifetime of the survivor, then within 60 days of termination, the right to \nreceive from Trust an amount equal to the greater of the cash surrender value of the \npolicy, or the premiums paid by Settlor A and Settlor B, to the extent Trust has other \n3\nPLR-118835-99\nassets.  Under the Agreement, all incidents of ownership over the policy (including the \nsole right to surrender or cancel the policy, and the sole right to borrow or withdraw \nagainst the policy) are vested in the Trustees of Trust.\nYou have asked that we rule as follows: \n1.  The payment by Settlor A and B of the premiums pursuant to the Agreement \nwill not result in a gift or a deemed gift to the Trust by Settlor A and B under \u00a7\u00a7 2501 \nand 2511.\n2. The insurance proceeds payable to the Trust will not be includible under \n\u00a7 2042 in the gross estate of either Settlor A or B.\nISSUE 1                             \n \nSection 1.61-22(b)(1) provides that a split-dollar life insurance arrangement is \nany arrangement between an owner and a non-owner of a life insurance contract that \nsatisfies the following criteria\u2014(i) either party to the arrangement pays, directly or \nindirectly, all or any portion of the premiums on the life insurance contract, including a \npayment by means of a loan to the other party that is secured by the life insurance \ncontract; (ii) at least one of the parties to the arrangement paying premiums is entitled to \nrecover (either conditionally or unconditionally) all or any portion of those premiums and \nsuch recovery is to be made from, or is secured by, the proceeds of the life insurance \ncontract; and (iii) the arrangement is not part of a group-term life insurance plan \ndescribed in section 79.\nSection 1.61-22(b)(3)(ii)(B) provides that section 1.61-22(d) through (g) applies \n(and section 1.7872-15, addressing split-dollar loans does not apply) to any split-dollar \nlife insurance arrangement where the arrangement is entered into between a donor and \na donee (for example, a life insurance trust) and the donor is the owner of the life \ninsurance contract (or is treated as the owner of the contract under section 1.61-\n22(c)(1)(ii)(A)(2)).  \nSection 1.61-22(c)(1) provides, in general, that with respect to a life insurance \ncontract, the person named as the policy owner of such contract generally is the owner \nof such contract.\nSection 1.61-22(c)(1)(ii)(A)(2) provides that a donor is treated as the owner of a \nlife insurance contract under a split-dollar life insurance arrangement that is entered into \nbetween a donor and a donee (for example, a life insurance trust) if, at all times, the \nonly economic benefit that will be provided under the arrangement is current life \ninsurance protection as described in section 1.61-22(d)(3).\n4\nPLR-118835-99\nSection 1.61-22(d)(1) provides in part, that in the case of a split-dollar life \ninsurance arrangement subject to the rules under section 1.61-22(d) through (g), \neconomic benefits are treated as being provided to the non-owner of the life insurance \ncontract.  The non-owner (and the owner for gift and employment tax purposes) must \ntake into account the full value of all economic benefits described in section 1.61-\n22(d)(2), reduced by the consideration paid directly or indirectly by the non-owner to the \nowner for those economic benefits.  Depending on the relationship between the owner \nand the non-owner, the economic benefits may constitute a payment of compensation, \na distribution under section 301, a contribution of capital, a gift, or a transfer having a \ndifferent tax character.\nSection 1.61-22(d)(2) provides generally that the value of the economic benefits \nprovided to a non-owner for a taxable year under the arrangement equals: (i) the cost of \ncurrent life insurance protection provided to the non-owner determined under section \n1.61-22(d)(3); (ii) the amount of policy cash value to which the non-owner has current \naccess within the meaning of section 1.61-22(d)(4)(ii) (to the extent such amount was \nnot actually taken into account for a prior taxable year); and (iii) the value of any \neconomic benefits not described above provided to a non-owner (to the extent not \nactually taken into account for a prior taxable year).\nSection 1.61-22(d)(3)(i) provides, in part, that the amount of current life insurance \nprotection provided to the non-owner for a taxable year (or any portion thereof in the \ncase of the first year or the last year of the arrangement) equals the excess of the death \nbenefit of the life insurance contract (including paid-up additions thereto) over the total \namount payable to the owner (including any outstanding policy loans that offset \namounts otherwise payable to the owner) under the split-dollar life insurance \narrangement, less the portion of the policy cash value actually taken into account under \nsection 1.61-22(d)(1) or paid for by the non-owner under section 1.61-22(d)(1) for the \ncurrent taxable year or any prior taxable year.  \nSection 1.61-22(d)(3)(ii) provides that the cost of current life insurance protection \nprovided to the non-owner for any year (or any portion thereof in the case of the first \nyear or the last year of the arrangement) equals the amount of current life insurance \nprojection provided to the non-owner (determined under section 1.61-22(d)(3)(i)) \nmultiplied by the life insurance premium factor designated or permitted in guidance \npublished in the Internal Revenue Bulletin.\nSection 1.61-22(d)(4)(ii) provides in part, that for purposes of section 1.61-22(d), \na non-owner has current access to that portion of the policy cash value to which, under \nthe arrangement, the non-owner has a current or future right; and that currently is \ndirectly or indirectly accessible by the non-owner, inaccessible to the owner, or \ninaccessible to the owner\u2019s general creditors.\n5\nPLR-118835-99\nIn the present case, under section 1.61-22(c)(1)(ii)(A)(2), A and B will be treated\nas the owners of Policy, because under the terms of the Agreement, the only economic \nbenefit that will be provided under the split-dollar arrangement is current life insurance \nprotection.   Under the terms of the Agreement, Trust will pay the portion of the premium \nequal to the cost of current life insurance protection and Settlor A and B will pay the \nbalance of the premium.  Settlor A and/or B (or the estate of the survivor) will be entitled \nto receive an amount equal to the greater of the policy cash surrender value or \npremiums paid on early termination or at the death of the survivor. We conclude that the \npayment of the premiums by Settlors A and B, pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, \nwill not result in a gift by Settlor A and B under section 2511, provided that the amounts \npaid by the Trust for the life insurance benefit that the Trust receives under the \nAgreement is at least equal to the amount prescribed under Notice 2001-10\nWe also conclude that, if some or all of the cash surrender value is used (either \ndirectly, or indirectly through loans) to fund the Trust\u2019s obligation to pay premiums, \nSettlor A and B will be treated as making a gift at that time. \nWe express no opinion concerning the federal gift tax consequences between A\nand B of the second-to-die policies.  \nRuling Request 2                                                                             \nSection 2042(1) provides that the value of a decedent\u2019s gross estate shall include \nthe proceeds of insurance policies on the decedent\u2019s life receivable by the decedent\u2019s \nestate. \nSection 2042(2) provides that the value of a decedent\u2019s gross estate shall include \nthe proceeds of all life insurance policies on the decedent\u2019s life receivable by \nbeneficiaries other than the executor of the decedent\u2019s estate, to the extent that the \ndecedent possessed at his death any incidents of ownership exercisable either alone or \nin conjunction with any other person.  An incident of ownership includes a reversionary \ninterest arising by the express terms of the instrument or by operation of law only if the \nvalue of such reversionary interest exceeds 5 percent of the value of the policy \nimmediately before the death of the decedent.\nSection 2042-1(c)(2) of the Estate Tax Regulations provides that \u201cincidents of \nownership\u201d is not limited in its meaning to ownership of a policy in the technical legal \nsense.  Generally, the term has reference to the right of the insured or his estate to the \neconomic benefits of the policy.  Thus, it includes power to change the beneficiary, to \nsurrender or cancel the policy, to assign the policy, to revoke an assignment, to pledge \nthe policy for a loan, or to obtain from the insurer a loan against the surrender value of \nthe policy.\n6\nPLR-118835-99\nIn the present case, under Agreement and the collateral assignment, neither Settlor  \nA nor B will hold any incidents of ownership in Policy.  As noted above, all incidents of \nownership in the policies, including the power to change the beneficiary, the power to \nsurrender or cancel the policy, the power to assign the policy or to revoke an \nassignment, and the power to pledge the policy for a loan or to obtain from the insurer \nare vested in the Trustee of Trust.  Accordingly, we conclude that the proceeds of the \npolicy payable to the Trust will not be included in the gross estate of the second to die of \nA and B under section 2042(2). The portion of the proceeds payable to the estate of the \nsurvivor of A and B will be includible under section 2042(1). See, e.g., Rev. Rul. 79-129, \n1979-1 C.B. 306. \nExcept as specifically set forth above, we express no opinion concerning the \nfederal tax consequences of the foregoing transactions under any other provisions of \nthe Code or regulations.   \nUnder a power of attorney on file with this office, we are sending a copy of this \nletter to Trustee\u2019s authorized representative. \nThis ruling is directed only to the taxpayer requesting it.

Therefore, we are studying whether it remains appropriate to \ncharacterize the transaction as a contract when a charitable lead trust is involved and whether it \nis appropriate to conclude that the charitable lead trust will realize unrelated trade or business \nincome.   \n \nTherefore, this is to clarify the prior ruling that while O may continue to reinvest money in M\u2019s \nendowment that was previously held in the endowment as of the date of this letter without \ngenerating unrelated business taxable income to O, this ruling does not apply to new money \ninvested in M\u2019s endowment after the date of this letter.  \n \nThe prior ruling is also modified by deleting all references to N.     \n \nT A X  E X E M P T  A N D  \nG O V E R N M E N T  E N T I T I E S \nD I V I S I O N  \n \n \n2 \n \n \n \n \nThis ruling will be made available for public inspection under section 6110 of the Code after \ncertain deletions of identifying information are made.

Additional information was \nreceived in a letter dated February 15, 2005.  The material information submitted for \nconsideration is summarized below. \n \n \nPLR-145219-04 \n \n3 \nSUMMARY OF FACTS \n \n \nTaxpayer is the common parent of an affiliated group of corporations that files a \nconsolidated calendar year federal income tax return using the accrual method of \naccounting (the \u201cTaxpayer Group\u201d).  All of the stock of Taxpayer is indirectly owned by \nParent.  Taxpayer is a holding company that owns all of the outstanding stock of Sub1 \nand Sub2.  Sub1 owns all of the outstanding stock of Sub3.   \n \n \nPrior to Date 1, Parent had a single class of common stock outstanding.  On \nDate 1, Parent issued a shares of Preferred Stock to Company X for an aggregate \npurchase price of $b ($c per share).  The Preferred Stock constitutes stock for section \n382 purposes.  At all times since the issuance of the Preferred Stock, Company X has \nbeen an indirect subsidiary of Company Y.  Company X has continuously held the \nPreferred Stock since it was issued. \n \n \nFollowing Date 1, Sub1 and Sub3 increased their tax reserves for Year 1 by \napproximately $d and $e, respectively.  The tax deductions attributable to these \nadditions to reserves significantly contributed to the Taxpayer Group\u2019s Year 1 net \noperating loss of approximately $f.  Similarly, in Year 2, Sub1 and Sub3 increased their \ntax reserves by approximately $g and $h, respectively.  The tax deductions attributable \nto these additions to reserves significantly contributed to the Taxpayer Group\u2019s Year 2 \nnet operating loss of approximately $i.   \n \n \nIn addition, during this time, Taxpayer\u2019s business was deteriorating.  Following \nDate 1, Parent\u2019s common stock declined in value relative to the value of its Preferred \nStock, in part as a result of the additions to reserves and the business deterioration.  At \nno time after the end of Year 1 has Parent\u2019s common stock traded at more than $j. \n \n \nOn Date 2, Taxpayer filed a petition with the bankruptcy court for relief under \nChapter 11 of the United States Code.  During the period beginning with Date 1 and \nending on Date 2, certain owner shifts occurred as a result of purchases and sales of \nParent\u2019s common stock.  These owner shifts were as follows: (1) approximately k \nshares of Parent common stock were acquired by employees and directors of the \nTaxpayer group (and related entities) pursuant to employee and director stock purchase \nplans; (2) l restricted shares of Parent common stock vested, resulting in m shares of \nParent common stock being issued on Date 3, when the stock was trading at \napproximately $n, and o shares of Parent common stock being issued on or about Date \n4, when the stock was trading at approximately $p per share; and, (3) higher tier entities \nwith respect to Taxpayer disposed of q shares of Parent common stock (the \u201cParent \nOwner Shifts\u201d). \n \n \nTaxpayer expects to emerge from bankruptcy under a plan of reorganization (the \n\u201cPlan\u201d) that will result in an ownership change within the meaning of section 382(g) (the \n\u201cPlan Ownership Change\u201d).  Subsequent to consummation of the Plan and the Plan \nOwnership Change, Sub1 expects to realize income as a result of extinguishing \n \nPLR-145219-04 \n \n4 \nobligations under contracts in amounts that are less than the reserves associated with \nsuch contracts (\u201cCommutation Income\u201d), thus reversing some of the reserves previously \ntaken.    \n \nRULINGS \n \n \nBased solely on the information submitted as set forth above, for purposes of \nfactoring out changes in proportionate ownership of Taxpayer\u2019s stock which are \nattributable solely to fluctuations in the relative fair market values of different classes of \nstock under section 382(l)(3)(C), we hold that Taxpayer may apply the following \nprinciple with respect to the Parent Owner Shifts: \n \n \nOn any testing date, in determining the ownership percentage of any 5% \nshareholder, the value of such shareholder\u2019s stock, relative to the value of all \nother stock of Taxpayer, shall be considered to remain constant since the date \nthat shareholder acquired the stock; and the value of such shareholder\u2019s stock \nrelative to the value of all other stock of Taxpayer issued subsequent to such \nacquisition date shall also be considered to remain constant since that \nsubsequent date. \n \n \nExcept as expressly provided herein, no opinion is expressed or implied \nconcerning the tax consequences of any aspect of any transaction or item discussed or \nreferenced in this letter.  Further, in the event that any shareholder acquired stock prior \nto the beginning of the testing period, no opinion is expressed regarding whether the \nprinciple described above should apply to factor out the effect of fluctuations in value of \nsuch stock relative to the value of other stock that occur prior to the testing period. \n \n \nThe rulings contained in this letter are based upon information and \nrepresentations submitted by the taxpayer and accompanied by a penalty of perjury \nstatement executed by an appropriate party.  While this office has not verified any of the \nmaterial submitted in support of the request for rulings, it is subject to verification on \nexamination. \n \n \nThis ruling is directed only to the taxpayer(s) requesting it.

On D1, X established Trust 1 and Trust 2 (collectively, the\nTrusts).  The Trusts are revocable during X\u2019s life, and become irrevocable upon X\u2019s\ndeath.  X has designated Trust 1 as the primary beneficiary of IRA 1 and Trust 2 as the\nprimary beneficiary of IRA 2.  X has further designated that the minimum required\ndistributions (MRDs) payable by the IRAs to the Trusts shall be determined using the\nlife expectancies of X and the oldest designated beneficiary of the Trust receiving\n2\nPLR-137754-01\ndistributions from that IRA.  The Trusts will have no assets other than the MRDs\nreceived from the IRAs.\nA, B, C, and D are the beneficiaries of Trust 1 during their lifetimes.  C and D are\nthe beneficiaries of Trust 2 during their lifetimes.  Both Trusts contain provisions\nallowing additional beneficiaries to be added to the Trusts during X\u2019s life.   During X\u2019s\nlife, X will be entitled to receive all of the MRDs received by the Trusts.  After X\u2019s death,\nthe Trusts provide that the MRDs received by the Trusts shall be divided into equal\nshares for the beneficiaries of the respective Trusts and currently paid to the respective\nbeneficiaries or for their benefit.  Trust 2 provides that the MRDs received may be\nreallocated among the beneficiaries within certain discretionary powers of the trustee,\nbut that the entire amount of the MRDs received during the year will be distributed\ncurrently.    \nX requests a ruling that the payments made after X\u2019s death to the Trusts will be\nincluded in the distributable net income (DNI) of the Trusts, deductible by the Trusts,\nand taxable to the beneficiaries in the year paid to the beneficiaries.  \nSection 691(a)(1) of the Code provides that the amount of all items of gross\nincome in respect of a decedent which are not properly includable in respect of the\ntaxable period in which falls the date of the decedent\u2019s death or a prior period (including\nthe amount of all items of gross income in respect of a prior decedent, if the right to\nreceive such amount was acquired by reason of the death of the prior decedent or by\nbequest, devise, or inheritance from the prior decedent) shall be included in the gross\nincome, for the taxable year when received, of: (A) the estate of the decedent, if the\nright to receive the amount is acquired by the decedent\u2019s estate from the decedent; (B)\nthe person who, by reason of the death of the decedent, acquires the right to receive\nthe amount, if the right to receive the amount is not acquired by the decedent\u2019s estate\nfrom the decedent; or (C) the person who acquires from the decedent the right to\nreceive the amount by bequest, devise, or inheritance, if the amount is received after a\ndistribution by the decedent\u2019s estate of such right.\nSection 661(a) provides that in any taxable year there shall be allowed as a\ndeduction in computing the taxable income of an estate or trust (other than a trust to\nwhich subpart B applies), the sum of (1) any amount of income for such taxable year\nrequired to be distributed currently (including any amount required to be distributed\nwhich may be paid out of income or corpus to the extent such amount is paid out of\nincome for such taxable year); and (2) any other amounts properly paid or credited or\nrequired to be distributed for such taxable year; but such deduction shall not exceed the\ndistributable net income (DNI) of the estate or trust.\nSection 643(a) provides that the term \u201cdistributable net income\u201d (DNI), means,\nwith respect to any taxable year, the taxable income of the estate or trust computed\nwith the modifications provided in \u00a7\u00a7 643(a)(1) through (7).\n3\nPLR-137754-01\n Based solely on the facts and representations submitted, we conclude that the\npayments to the Trusts from the IRAs constitute ordinary gross income in respect of a\ndecedent of the Trusts under \u00a7 691.  We further conclude that these payments will be\ndeductible by the Trusts as amounts properly paid or distributed under \u00a7 661(a)(2) to\nthe extent of the DNI of each Trust and taxable to the beneficiaries in the year paid to\nthe beneficiaries.\nExcept as set forth above, no opinion is expressed or implied as to the federal\nincome tax consequences of the transactions described above under any other\nprovision of the Code. \nThis ruling is directed only to the taxpayer on whose behalf it was requested. \nSection 6110(k)(3) provides that it may not be used or cited as precedent.\nSincerely yours,\nJ.

Specifically, you request the following rulings: \n1.  That Receiver is not required to file federal income tax returns for Tax Years\n1, 2, 3, and any taxable year during the duration of the receivership with respect\nto the following Defendants:\na.  Individual 1; \nb.  Individual 2;\nc.  Individual 3 (and/or the estate of Individual 3); \nd.  Corporate Defendant 1;\ne.  Corporate Defendant 2; \nf.   Corporate Defendant 3; \ng.  Corporate Defendant 4; and\nh.  Corporate Defendant 5.  \n2.     That, with respect to filing federal income tax returns for Company 1,\nReceiver, as sole director of the corporation shall: \na.  Direct the officers of the corporation to prepare, sign, and file federal\nincome tax returns with respect to Tax Years 1, 2, 3, and all future years\nduring which Receiver serves as director;\n \nb.  Exclude revenues and expenses arising with respect to any and all of\nthe properties currently titled in the names of the various Defendants; and \nc.  Generate a single K-1 as part of this process and issue it to Individual\n3, his successors, assigns, and/or heirs.\nYou have expressed that, although Receiver may not be required to file federal income\ntax returns with respect to Defendants, Receiver is willing to file information returns on\nbehalf of Company 1 reflecting the Defendants\u2019 share of income and gain received by\nCompany 1 on their behalf for Tax Years 1, 2, 3, and any subsequent tax year in which\nhe remains Receiver.\nCC:PA:APJP:01/PLR-154862-01\n3\n \nFacts\nIndividual 1 and Individual 2 are husband and wife, and parents of Individual 3.  From\nDate 1 to Date 2,  Individual 1 owned and controlled several corporations with business\nactivities throughout the United States.  During this time, Individual 1 used nominees,\nforeign corporations, and off-shore accounts to conceal ownership of his and Individual\n3\u2019s assets in the United States.  Several companies were formed and used by Individual\n1 in his efforts to evade taxes.  Each of the corporate Defendants listed above has\nbeen used to evade taxes by Individual 1 and/or Individual 3.   \nCorporate Defendant 1 was formed by Individual 1.  Although initially owned by\nIndividual 1, the most recent tax returns for Corporate Defendant 1 suggest that all of\nthe stock is owned by Corporate Defendant 2, a foreign corporation that is owned,\naccording to the Defendants, by foreign investors.  In addition, Corporate Defendant 3\nand Corporate Defendant 4 have both been reported as being owned by Corporate\nDefendant 1.  Corporate Defendant 5 is a company that was owned by Individual 3. \nAlthough questions  exist regarding ownership of some of the companies, each has real\nproperty in the United States to which federal tax liens have attached.      \nDuring Tax Year 1, the United States brought an action in a United States District Court,\nand pursuant to section 7401 of the Internal Revenue Code (Code), sought to: (1)\nreduce unpaid federal income and transferee tax liabilities of the Defendants to\njudgment; (2) foreclose on federal tax liens against Defendants; (3) sell property subject\nto the federal tax liens; and (4) upon proper application, have a receiver in equity\nappointed.  The action was brought against Defendants and third parties holding\nsecurity interests in certain real properties subject to the federal tax liens.  By the\ncourt\u2019s order, Receiver was appointed primarily to take possession of and manage the\nreal properties subject to the federal tax liens, protect the tenants\u2019 interests therein,\npreserve the value of the properties, and provide for the orderly sale of the properties in\na manner and on terms, as directed by the court.  \nPursuant to the appointment, Receiver took control of the real properties subject to the\nfederal tax liens.  Although title to the properties was held in the names of the various\nentities under the receivership order, revenues and expenses generated by all of these\nproperties have been handled through accounts managed by Company 1, an S\nCorporation formed by Individual 3. \nAlthough the record owners of the stock of Company 1 are listed as Individual 3's\nchildren, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) determined that Individual 3 is the\nbeneficial owner of the stock and seized the stock as personal property of Individual 3. \nAt a special meeting of the shareholders, Receiver took possession of the stock from\nthe IRS.   Shortly thereafter, the court confirmed that Individual 3 owned the stock of\nCompany 1, with his children as nominees.  The real properties held in receivership\ncontinue to be managed by Company 1, with Receiver as sole director of the\ncorporation.\nCC:PA:APJP:01/PLR-154862-01\n4\nIndividual 1 and Individual 2 currently reside in one of the rental properties held in\nreceivership.  Individual 3 left the United States shortly after the IRS made jeopardy\nassessments against him.  Since then, a suggestion of Individual 3\u2019s death has been\nfiled with the federal court.  However, no death certificate has been filed and no probate\nproceedings initiated with respect to the suggestion of his death.   \nLaw and Analysis \nReceiver\u2019s Filing Obligations for Individual Defendants\nSection 6012(a) of the Code provides, in part, that returns with respect to income taxes\nshall be made by every individual, with certain exceptions, and every corporation\nsubject to taxation.  \nSection 1.6012-3(b)(5) of the Income Tax Regulations (regulations) requires a receiver\nwho stands in place of an individual to file the required income tax return with respect to\nthat individual.  However, section 1.6012-3(b)(5) also provides that when the receiver\nhas only part of the property of the individual, he is not required to make the return and\nthe individual must file his own.  \nIn the present situation, with respect to Individual 1 and Individual 2, Receiver is not\nrequired to file income tax returns because he does not have all of their property. \nIndividual 1 has used multiple nominees, foreign corporations, and off-shore accounts\nto conceal ownership of his assets in the United States.  While Receiver has\npossession of properties owned by some of the companies created by Individual 1, he\ndoes not have all the property owned by Individual 1 and Individual 2.  Therefore, he is\nnot required to make the necessary federal income tax returns for Individual 1 and\nIndividual 2.  \nLikewise, Receiver is not required to file income tax returns for Individual 3.  Receiver\nhas possession of Individual 3\u2019s stock in Company 1, but has no other assets owned by\nhim.  Since Receiver does not have possession of all property owned by Individual 3,\nhe is not required to make the necessary federal income tax returns with respect to\nIndividual 3.       \nReceiver\u2019s Filing Obligations for Corporate Defendants\nSection 6012(b)(3) of the Code provides that in a case where a receiver, by order of a\ncourt of competent jurisdiction, by operation of law or otherwise has possession of or\nholds title to all or substantially all the property or business of a corporation, whether or\nnot such property or business is being operated, such receiver shall make the return of\nincome for such corporation in the same manner and form as corporations are required\nto make such returns.\nSection 1.6012-3(b)(4) of the regulations provides that a receiver in charge of only a\nsmall part of the property of a corporation need not make the return of income.  \nCC:PA:APJP:01/PLR-154862-01\n5\nThe principle set forth in section 6012(b)(3) of the Code and section 1.6012-3(b)(4) of\nthe regulations was explained in 1932 by the United States Supreme Court in North\nAmerican Oil v. Burnet, 286 U.S. 417, 422 (1932), where the Court held the following:\nFirst. The income earned in 1916 and impounded by the receiver in that year\nwas not taxable to him, because he was the receiver of only a part of the\nproperties operated by the company.  Under section 13(c) of the Revenue Act of\n1916, receivers who \u2018are operating the property or business of corporations,\u2019 and\n\u2018any income tax due\u2019 was to be \u2018assessed and collected in the same manner as if\nassessed directly against the organization of whose business or properties they\nhave custody and control.\u2019 The phraseology of this section was adopted without\nchange in the Revenue Act of 1918, 40 Stat. 1057, 1081, c 18, section 239.  The\nregulations of the Treasury Department have consistently construed these\nstatutes as applying only to receivers in charge of the entire property or business\nof a corporation; and in all other cases have required the corporations\nthemselves to report their income.  Treas. Regs. 33, arts. 26, 209; Treas. Regs.\n45, arts. 424, 622.  That construction is clearly correct.  The language of the\nsection contemplates a substitution of the receiver for the corporation; and there\ncan be such substitution of the receiver for the corporation; and there can be\nsuch substitution only when the receiver is in complete control of the properties\nand business of the corporation.  Moreover, there is no provision for the\nconsolidation of the return of a receiver of part of a corporation\u2019s property or\nbusiness with the return of the corporation itself.  It may not be assumed that\nCongress intended to require the filing of two separate returns for the same year,\neach covering only a part of the corporate income, without making provision for\nconsolidation so that the tax could be based upon the income as a whole.\nIn the present situation, Receiver does not have possession of or hold title to all or\nsubstantially all the property or business of the corporate Defendants.  Many of the\ncompanies may be foreign corporations and have been used to conceal assets owned\nby the individual Defendants.  Receiver has possession of only certain real property\nlocated in the United States to which federal tax liens have attached.  Receiver is not in\ncomplete control of all property and business of the corporate Defendants and is unable\nto prepare complete and accurate returns for the companies.  Therefore, Receiver is\nnot required to file income tax returns for the corporate Defendants.  \nReceiver\u2019s Filing Obligations for Company 1\nIn accordance with the requirement in section 6012 of the Code that every corporation\nsubject to taxation file an income tax return, section 6037(a) provides that every\nS Corporation shall make a return stating specifically the items of its gross income and\nallowable deductions, the names and addresses of all persons owning stock in the\ncorporation and the number of shares of stock owned by each shareholder.\nSection 1.6037-1(a) of the regulations provides that an S corporation must file Form\n1120S, U.S. Income Tax Return for an S Corporation, setting forth the items of gross\nCC:PA:APJP:01/PLR-154862-01\n6\nincome and the deductions allowable in computing taxable income as required by the\nreturn form or in the instructions issued with respect thereto, and signed in accordance\nwith section 6062 of the Code by the person authorized to sign a return.\nSection 6062 of the Code states that the return of a corporation with respect to income\nshall be signed by the president, vice-president, treasurer, assistant treasurer, chief\naccounting officer, or any other officer duly authorized so to act.\nIn the present situation, Company 1 is an S corporation subject to taxation and is\nrequired to make returns of income.   Receiver, as sole director of the corporation, is\nrequired to  ensure that the necessary returns are prepared and signed by the officer(s)\nduly authorized to sign the returns.  The income tax returns must be made on Form\n1120S and should exclude revenues and expenses associated with the real properties\nmanaged by Company 1 to the extent that they are not items of gross income or\ndeductions allowable in computing the taxable income of the corporation.  Receiver\nshall issue the accompanying Form K-1 to Individual 3, his successors, assigns, and/or\nheirs, reflecting his allocable share of the income and/or deductions of the corporation\nas owner of 100% of the stock of Company 1.  \nConclusion\nBased on the information provided and the representations made, we conclude the\nfollowing:\n1.  That, with respect to Tax Years 1, 2, 3, and any taxable year during the\nduration of the receivership:  \na.  Receiver is not required to file federal income tax returns for any of the\nindividual Defendants because he does not have possession of all\nproperty owned by them; and\n \nb.  Receiver is not required to file federal income tax returns for any of the\ncorporate Defendants since he does not have possession of or hold title\nto all or substantially all of the property and business of those\ncorporations.  \n2.  That, with respect to Tax Years 1, 2, 3 and all future years during which\nReceiver is director of Company 1:  \na.  Receiver is required to ensure that federal income tax returns are\nprepared, signed by the appropriate official and filed in accordance with\napplicable tax laws; \nb.  Revenues and expenses derived from the properties held in\nreceivership shall be excluded from the returns to the extent that they are\nnot items of gross income or deductions allowable in computing taxable\nCC:PA:APJP:01/PLR-154862-01\n7\nincome for Company 1; and \nc.  Receiver is required to issue Form K-1 to Individual 3, his successors,\nassigns, and/or heirs, as the sole shareholder of Company 1.\nReceiver\u2019s willingness to file information returns on behalf of Company 1 with respect to\neach of the Defendants reflecting their share of income or gain received on their behalf\nby Company 1 is generally consistent with the purpose of the information reporting\nguidelines.  Therefore, Receiver should file the appropriate information returns on\nbehalf of Company 1 with respect to the Defendants showing their share of income or\ngain received by Company 1 on their behalf.\nThis ruling is directed only to the taxpayer(s) requesting it.  Section 6110(k)(3) of the Code\nprovides that it may not be used or cited as precedent.\nSincerely,\nJames C.

While this office has not verified any of the material submitted \nin support of the request for rulings, it is subject to verification on examination.\nFACTS\nTaxpayer is the ------percent owner of US Sub, which indirectly owns ----- percent of \nCFC, a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes that is incorporated in Country \nA and is a controlled foreign corporation within the meaning of section 957. CFC owns --\n---- percent of the shares of Partnership, a Country A entity that is classified as a \npartnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Foreign Corporation, an unrelated \nCountry A corporation, owns the remaining ---- percent of Partnership.  Partnership \nowns all of the outstanding equity of DE, a Country A entity that is classified as a \ndisregarded entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nDE is constructing a plant in Country A to produce Product. DE is and will be involved in \nthe development, design, construction, commissioning, ownership, and operation of the \nplant. All of DE\u2019s assets and operations are in Country A. Partnership\u2019s business \nconsists of the evaluation, acquisition, development, construction, operation, leasing, \nand other management of the Product production business conducted by it through DE. \nAs is typical of plants producing Product, the ongoing operation of the plant after its \ndevelopment and construction by DE will require a relatively low level of activity and \nexpense, in terms of both personnel and raw materials, as compared to plants for other \ntypes of y.\nThe operations of the plant will be managed by a general manager, who is a full-time \nemployee of DE. The general manager\u2019s role is to ensure that the plant is built on \nschedule, within budget, and to specifications, and, once the plant is operational, that \nthe plant operates in accordance with good industry practice to maximize its output. The \ngeneral manager will supervise the service providers\u2019 performance, oversee compliance \nunder the plant\u2019s outputs contract with the customer, supervise actual performance of \nthe plant, develop budget and business plans, maintain governmental approvals \nrequired for the project, and supervise other employees of DE, among other functions. \nThe general manager will report to the board of Partnership. \nDE will hire a service provider to provide specialized services in the maintenance and \noperation of the plant. In particular, the service provider will provide DE with certain \ncontinuous system monitoring, performance engineering, emergency response, \nmaintenance, and similar functions. The persons performing these duties will be hired \nand paid by the service provider. DE will supervise the service provider\u2019s performance \nbut will have no direct relationship with the service provider\u2019s employees, except that \nPLR-131527-12\n3\nDE will retain the right to direct the service provider to remove any employee that falls \nbelow certain standards.\nDuring the first x years of operation, all of the Product produced at the plant will be sold \nunder an outputs contract to an unrelated Country A corporation that is wholly owned by \na subdivision of the Country A government.  Partnership does not purchase any \npersonal property from CFC or any person related to CFC. Product will be sold at a \nfixed price subject to adjustment based on a local consumer price index. Thus, during \nthe period subject to this long term contract, DE bears no meaningful economic \nexposure to variations in the price of Product and cannot engage in speculative \nbehavior with regard to the Product it produces because all of Product will be \nimmediately provided to the purchaser at a pre-determined price.\nTaxpayer represents that substantially all of CFC\u2019s and Partnership\u2019s commodities are \nproperty described in section 1221(a)(1), (2), or (8).\nRULING REQUESTED\nCFC\u2019s distributive share of income from Partnership\u2019s business of producing and selling \nProduct is not includible in foreign base company income under section 954.\nLAW\nA U.S. shareholder of a controlled foreign corporation (CFC) is generally required to \ninclude in income on a current basis its pro rata share of the CFC\u2019s subpart F income. \nSection 951(a). Subpart F income includes foreign base company income, which \nconsists of several categories of income, including foreign base company sales income \n(FBC Sales Income), foreign base company services income (FBC Services Income), \nand foreign personal holding company income (FPHCI). Sections 952 and 954.\nSection 954(d)(1) defines FBC Sales Income to mean income (whether in the form of \nprofits, commissions, fees, or otherwise) derived in connection with: the purchase of \npersonal property from a related person and its sale to any person, the sale of personal \nproperty to any person on behalf of a related person, the purchase of personal property \nfrom any person and its sale to a related person, or the purchase of personal property \nfrom any person on behalf of a related person where (A) the property which is \npurchased (or in the case of property sold on behalf of a related person, the property \nwhich is sold) is manufactured, produced, grown, or extracted outside the country under \nthe laws of which the CFC is created or organized, and (B) the property is sold for use, \nconsumption, or disposition outside such foreign country, or, in the case of property \npurchased on behalf of a related person, is purchased for use, consumption, or \ndisposition outside such foreign country.\nPLR-131527-12\n4\nSection 954(d)(2) provides that when the carrying on of activities by a CFC through a \nbranch (or similar establishment) outside the country of incorporation of the CFC has \nsubstantially the same effect as if such branch were a wholly owned subsidiary \ncorporation deriving such income, the income attributable to the carrying on of such \nactivities of such branch shall constitute FBC Sales Income.\nSection 954(e)(1) defines FBC Services Income to mean income derived in connection \nwith the performance of technical, managerial, engineering, architectural, scientific, \nskilled, industrial, commercial, or like services which (A) are performed for or on behalf \nof any related person and (B) are performed outside the country under the laws of which \nthe controlled foreign corporation is created or organized.\nSection 954(c)(1) defines FPHCI to include interest, dividends, rents, and royalties, as \nwell as the excess of gains over losses from transactions (including futures, forward, \nand similar transactions) in any commodities. However, net gains from transactions in \ncommodities do not constitute FPHCI if one of three statutory exceptions applies. One \nof these statutory exceptions applies to certain active business gains or losses from the \nsale of commodities. Specifically, section 954(c)(1)(C)(ii) provides that FPHCI does not \ninclude net gains from transactions in commodities if the gains are active business \ngains or losses from the sale of commodities and substantially all of the CFC\u2019s \ncommodities are property described in section 1221(a)(1), (2), or (8).\nTreas. Reg. \u00a7 1.952-1(g)(1) states that a CFC's distributive share of any item of \npartnership income is income that falls within a category of subpart F income described \nin section 952(a) to the extent the item of income would have been income in such \ncategory if received by the CFC directly.\nTreas. Reg. \u00a7 1.954-1(g)(1) provides that, to determine the extent to which a CFC's \ndistributive share of any item of gross income of a partnership would have been subpart \nF income if received by it directly, if a provision of subpart F requires a determination of \nwhether an entity is a related person within the meaning of section 954(d)(3), or whether \nan activity occurred within or outside the country under the laws of which the CFC is \ncreated or organized, this determination shall be made by reference to the CFC and not \nby reference to the partnership.\nTreas. Reg. \u00a7 1.954-2(a)(5) provides special rules for calculating FPHCI applicable to \ndistributive shares of partnership income. Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.954-2(a)(5)(ii)(A) provides \nthat the exclusion provided by Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.954-2(e)(3)(iv) shall apply only if such \nexception would have applied to exclude the income from FPHCI if the CFC had earned \nthe income directly, determined by taking into account only the activities of, and \nproperty owned by, the partnership and not the separate activities or property of the \nCFC or any other person.\nPLR-131527-12\n5\nTreas. Reg. \u00a7 1.954-4(b)(2)(iii) provides that a CFC\u2019s distributive share of a \npartnership\u2019s services income will be deemed to be derived from services performed for \nor on behalf of a related person, within the meaning of section 954(e)(1)(A), if the \npartnership is a related person with respect to the CFC under section 954(d)(3), and, in \nconnection with the services performed by the partnership, the CFC (or a person that is \na related person with respect to the CFC) provided assistance that would have \nconstituted substantial assistance contributing to the performance of such services if \nfurnished to the CFC by a related person.\nRULING\nAccordingly, based solely on the information and representations set forth above, it is \nheld that CFC\u2019s distributive share of income from Partnership\u2019s business of producing \nand selling Product is not includible in foreign base company income under section 954. \nExcept as expressly provided herein, no opinion is expressed or implied concerning the \ntax consequences of any aspect of any transaction or item discussed or referenced in \nthis letter.\nThis private letter ruling is directed only to the taxpayer who requested it. Code section \n6110(k)(3) provides that it may not be used or cited as precedent.\nA copy of this letter must be attached to any income tax return to which it is relevant. \nAlternatively, taxpayers filing their returns electronically may satisfy this requirement by \nattaching a statement to their return that provides the date and control number of the \nletter ruling.\nIn accordance with the Power of Attorney on file with this office, copies of this letter are \nbeing sent to Taxpayer's representatives.\nSincerely,\nJeffery G.

An adverse conference was held April \n17, 2006. \n \nPLR-168537-02 \n \n \n2 \n \nFACTS \n \n \nTaxpayer represents that the facts are as follows: \n \n \nTaxpayer is engaged as a public utility in the generation, transmission, \ndistribution and sale of electricity to customers in State.  Taxpayer is subject to the \nregulatory jurisdiction of A with regards to its terms and conditions of service, including \nthe rates it can charge for the provision of service.  Taxpayer is a member of an \naffiliated group headed by Parent and files a consolidated federal income tax return with \nParent. \n \n \nTaxpayer elected under former Code section 46(f)(2) to amortize its ADITC in \nreduction of the tax expense component of its cost of service no faster than ratably, and \nits regulated rate base is not reduced by its ADITC balance.  Taxpayer also uses a \nnormalization method of accounting for purposes of claiming accelerated depreciation \nwith respect to public utility property in accordance with former \u00a7\u00a7 167(l) and 168(f), and \nwith \u00a7 168(i)(9).  Moreover, Taxpayer has normalized its EDFIT in accordance with \u00a7 \n203(e) of the Act and Rev. Proc. 88-12, 1988-1 C.B. 637. \n \n \nIn B, State enacted Act.  Act provided that, effective C, all retail electric \ncustomers in State must be given the opportunity to purchase electricity from electric \npower suppliers of their choosing and that to implement retail choice, each utility must \n\u201cunbundled\u201d its rates so as to provide separate charges on its bills to customers for its \ngeneration services, for its transmission and distribution services, and for other discrete \nservices it provides to customers.  However, electric utilities\u2019 transmission and \ndistribution services were not deregulated under the Act, and the Taxpayer\u2019s rates for \nthese services continue to be subject to cost of service regulation by A.  The Act \nrecognized that the movement to a competitive market for electric generation would \nleave utilities in State with \u201cstranded costs,\u201d i.e., generation-related (and other supply-\nrelated) costs that traditionally would have been recoverable in a regulated environment \nbut that might no longer be recoverable after deregulation when the utilities\u2019 rates for \nelectric generation must be set at levels competitive with the rates charged by other \ngeneration suppliers not burdened with similar costs. \n \nThe Act authorized A to permit each public utility the opportunity to recovery its \nstranded costs, including generation plant stranded costs and stranded costs related to \nthe buydown or buyout of long-term power purchase contracts with non-utility \ngenerators.  On D, A issued an order to Taxpayer authorizing the issuance and sale of \nup to $ X aggregate principal amount of transition bonds to securitize the recovery of a \nportion of Subsidiary\u2019s bondable stranded costs.  Repayment of the bonds is \naccomplished through the imposition of a usage-based non-bypassable transition bond \ncharge (TBC) that the Taxpayer may collect from all of its customers throughout a \nlimited period determined by A.   \n \nPLR-168537-02 \n \n \n3 \n \nIn E, Taxpayer entered into purchase agreements to sell its interests in nuclear \ngeneration facilities.  On F, A approved the sale of the interests in the nuclear facilities.  \nHowever, due to regulatory delays associated with the sale of nuclear facilities, on G the \npurchase agreements were amended, with the buyers becoming responsible for the \noperating costs and risk of loss with respect to the nuclear facilities.  In return, the \nbuyers received 100% of the output associated with the nuclear facilities.  On H, \nTaxpayer closed the sale of the nuclear facilities. \n \nTaxpayer has reflected the deferred tax attributes associated with the nuclear \nfacilities on its regulatory books of account as follows: ADITC $ I, EDFIT $ J, and ADFIT \n$ K, as of C.  A has provided, in its order of  F, that it will reduce Taxpayer\u2019s stranded \ncosts associated with the nuclear facilities by the ADFIT, the EDFIT and the ADFIT, and \ndirecting Taxpayer to file for a letter ruling with the IRS regarding the treatment of the \nfederal tax benefits associated with the divested assets, with final determination of net \nproceeds and stranded costs to await the outcome of the ruling. \n  \nRULINGS REQUESTED \n \nTaxpayer requests the Internal Revenue Service to rule on four issues: \n \n1. Do the nuclear facilities cease to be \u201cpublic utility\u201d property with respect to \nTaxpayer on Date C, Date G, or Date H? \n \n2. Whether Taxpayer will violate the requirements of the depreciation \nnormalization rules set forth in former Code section 167(l) and Code section \n168 if it decreases the stranded cost of the nuclear facilities by the ADFIT \nassociated with such interest, thereby flowing the ADFIT through to \nTaxpayer\u2019s ratepayers? \n \n3. Whether Taxpayer will violate the requirements of the depreciation \nnormalization rules set forth in section 203(e) of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 \n(TRA 1986) if it decreases the stranded costs of the nuclear facilities by the \nEDFIT associated with such interest, thereby flowing the EDFIT through to \nTaxpayer\u2019s ratepayers? \n \n4. Whether Taxpayer will violate the requirements of the investment tax credit \nnormalization rules set forth in former Code section 46(f) if it decreases the \nstranded costs of the nuclear facilities by the ADITC associated with such \ninterest, thereby flowing the ADITC through to Taxpayer\u2019s ratepayers? \n \n \nPLR-168537-02 \n \n \n4 \n \nLAW AND ANALYSIS \n \n \nWith respect to the date the nuclear facilities cease to be \u201cpublic utility\u201d property \nwith respect to Taxpayer, Taxpayer states the as of C when the Act was effective, the \nnuclear facilities were operating under a order of A providing that while the nuclear \nfacilities were used to provide basic generation service, the price for such output would \nbe set on a rate base/rate of return basis.  On Date G, Taxpayer states it effectively \nremoved the nuclear facilities from its regulatory books of account as providers of basic \ngeneration service and as a result, no longer provided power associated with the \nnuclear facilities based upon a rate of return basis.  Pursuant to section 6.02 of \nRevenue Procedure 2006-1 (2006-1 IRB 1), the Service ordinarily will not rule on \nmatters that are significantly factual.  The issue of the date property ceases to be \u201cpublic \nutility\u201d property is, at least in part, a question of who is the owner and who bears the \nburdens and benefits of ownership.  Therefore, we decline to rule on this question. \n \n \nWith respect to the three normalization issues, the first determination involves the \nproper normalization treatment by Taxpayer, an elector under former \u00a7 46(f)(2), of its \nADITC relating to sales of its generating assets.  \n \n \nFormer \u00a7 46(f) provides an election for ratable flow through under which an \nelector may flow through the investment tax credit to cost of service.  However, former \n\u00a7 46(f)(2)(A) provides that no investment tax credit is available if the taxpayer's cost of \nservice for ratemaking purposes or in its regulated books of account is reduced by more \nthan a ratable portion of the credit determined under former \u00a7 46(a) and allowable by \n\u00a7 38.  Also, under former \u00a7 46(f)(2)(B), no investment tax credit is available if the base \nto which the taxpayer's rate of return for ratemaking purposes is applied is reduced by \nreason of any portion of the credit determined under former \u00a7 46(a) and allowable by \n\u00a7 38.  Section 1.46-6(b)(4) provides that the cost of service or rate base is also \nconsidered to have been reduced by reason of all or a portion of a credit if such \nreduction is made in an indirect manner.  In determining whether a ratemaking decision \nis intended to achieve this effect, consideration is given to all the relevant facts and \ncircumstances of each case, including, but not limited to the record of the proceeding, \nthe regulatory body\u2019s orders and opinions (including any dissenting views), and the \nanticipated effect of the ratemaking decision on the company\u2019s revenues in comparison \nto a direct reduction to cost of service or rate base by reason of the investment tax \ncredits available to the regulated company. \n \n \nFormer \u00a7 46(f)(6) provides that for purposes of determining ratable portions \nunder former \u00a7 46(f)(2)(A), the period of time used in computing depreciation expense \nfor purposes of reflecting operating results in the taxpayer's regulated books of account \nshall be used. \n  \n \nUnder \u00a7 1.46-6(g)(2) of the Income Tax Regulations, \u201cratable\u201d for purposes of \n \nPLR-168537-02 \n \n \n5 \nformer \u00a7 46(f)(2) is determined by considering the period of time actually used in \ncomputing the taxpayer's regulated depreciation expense for the property for which a \ncredit is allowed.  Regulated depreciation expense is the depreciation expense for the \nproperty used by a regulatory body for purposes of establishing the taxpayer's cost of \nservice for ratemaking purposes.  Such period of time shall be expressed in units of \nyears (or shorter periods), units of production, or machine hours and shall be \ndetermined in accordance with the individual useful life or composite (or other group \nasset) account system actually used in computing the taxpayer's regulated depreciation \nexpense.  A method of reducing is ratable if the amount to reduce cost of service is \nallocated ratably in proportion to the number of such units.  Thus, for example, assume \nthat the regulated depreciation expense is computed under the straight line method by \napplying a composite annual percentage rate to original cost (as defined for purposes of \ncomputing regulated depreciation expense).  If cost of service is reduced annually by an \namount computed by applying a composite annual percentage rate to the amount of the \ncredit, cost of service is reduced by a ratable portion.  If such composite annual \npercentage rate were revised for purposes of computing depreciation expense \nbeginning with a particular accounting period, the computation of ratable portion must \nalso be revised beginning with such period.  A composite annual percentage rate is \ndetermined solely by reference to the period of time actually used by the taxpayer in \ncomputing its regulated depreciation expense without reduction for salvage or other \nitems such as over and under accruals. \n \n \nThe method prescribed by \u00a7 1.46-6(g)(2) for determining whether the taxpayer's \ncost of service for ratemaking is reduced by more than a ratable portion of the \ninvestment tax credit depends upon correlating the credit with the regulatory \ndepreciable useful life actually used for the property that generated the credit.  That the \ncorrelation must remain constant and current is illustrated by the requirement that the \nratable portion must be adjusted to reflect correspondingly any revision to the composite \nannual percentage rate applied for purposes of computing regulated depreciation \nexpense. \n \n \nShould the property for which the ADITC is allowed become no longer available \nfor computing the regulated depreciation expense, there could no longer be any \ncorrelation between the property and the credit. In that event, the requirements of \nformer \u00a7 46(f)(2) are violated if any portion of the credit is used to reduce the taxpayer's \ncost of service. \n \n \nIn this case, Taxpayer has sold the assets that generated the ADITC and, as a \nresult, the asset for which regulated depreciation expense is computed is no longer \navailable.  Consequently, no portion of the related unamortized ADITC remaining at the \ndate of sale may be returned to ratepayers by amortizing those ADITC amounts over \nthe period Taxpayer recovers stranded costs from its ratepayers or by decreasing the \nnet loss from the sale of the nuclear facilities by those ADITC amounts.  \n \n \nPLR-168537-02 \n \n \n6 \n \nThe second determination involves the proper normalization treatment by \nTaxpayer of its ADFIT and EDFIT relating to the sale of its nuclear facilities. \n \n \n \nSection 168(f)(2) provides that the depreciation deduction determined under \n\u00a7 168 shall not apply to any public utility property (within the meaning of \u00a7 168(i)(10)) if \nthe taxpayer does not use a normalization method of accounting. \n \n \nIn order to use a normalization method of accounting, \u00a7 168(i)(9)(A)(i) requires \nthe taxpayer, in computing its tax expense for establishing its cost of service for \nratemaking purposes and reflecting operating results in its regulated books of account, \nto use a method of depreciation with respect to public utility property that is the same \nas, and a depreciation period for such property that is not shorter than, the method and \nperiod used to compute its depreciation expense for such purposes. \n \n \nUnder \u00a7 168(i)(9)(A)(ii), if the amount allowable as a deduction under \u00a7 168 \ndiffers from the amount that would be allowable as a deduction under \u00a7 167 using the \nmethod, period, first and last year convention, and salvage value used to compute \nregulated tax expense under \u00a7 168(i)(9)(A)(i), the taxpayer must make adjustments to a \nreserve to reflect the deferral of taxes resulting from such difference. \n \n \nSection 168(i)(9)(B)(i) provides that one way the requirements of \u00a7 168(i)(9)(A) \nwill not be satisfied is if the taxpayer, for ratemaking purposes, uses a procedure or \nadjustment which is inconsistent with such requirements. Under \u00a7 168(i)(9)(B)(ii), such \ninconsistent procedures and adjustments include the use of an estimate or projection of \nthe taxpayer's tax expense, depreciation expense, or reserve for deferred taxes under \n\u00a7 168(i)(9)(A)(ii), unless such estimate or projection is also used, for ratemaking \npurposes, with respect to all three of these items and with respect to the rate base. \n \n \nFormer \u00a7 167(l) generally provided that public utilities were entitled to use \naccelerated methods for depreciation if they used a \u201cnormalization method of \naccounting.\u201d  A normalization method of accounting was defined in former \u00a7 167(l)(3)(G) \nin a manner consistent with that found in \u00a7 168(i)(9)(A).  Section 1.167(l)-1(a)(1) \nprovides that the normalization requirements for public utility property pertain only to the \ndeferral of federal income tax liability resulting from the use of an accelerated method of \ndepreciation for computing the allowance for depreciation under \u00a7 167 and the use of \nstraight-line depreciation for computing tax expense and depreciation expense for \npurposes of establishing cost of services and for reflecting operating results in regulated \nbooks of account.  These regulations do not pertain to other book-tax timing differences \nwith respect to state income taxes, F.I.C.A. taxes, construction costs, or any other taxes \nand items. \n \n \nSection 1.167(l)-1(h)(1)(i) provides that the reserve established for public utility \nproperty should reflect the total amount of the deferral of federal income tax liability \n \nPLR-168537-02 \n \n \n7 \nresulting from the taxpayer's use of different depreciation methods for tax and \nratemaking purposes. \n \n \nSection 1.167(l)-1(h)(1)(iii) provides that the amount of federal income tax liability \ndeferred as a result of the use of different depreciation methods for tax and ratemaking \npurposes is the excess (computed without regard to credits) of the amount the tax \nliability would have been had the depreciation method for ratemaking purposes been \nused over the amount of the actual tax liability.  This amount shall be taken into account \nfor the taxable year in which the different methods of depreciation are used. \n \n \nSection 1.167(l)-1(h)(2)(i) provides that the taxpayer must credit this amount of \ndeferred taxes to a reserve for deferred taxes, a depreciation reserve, or other reserve \naccount.  This regulation further provides that the aggregate amount allocable to \ndeferred taxes shall not be reduced except to reflect the amount for any taxable year by \nwhich federal income taxes are greater by reason of the prior use of different methods \nof depreciation under \u00a7 1.167(l)-1(h)(1)(i) or to reflect asset retirements or the expiration \nof the period of depreciation used in determining the allowance for depreciation under \n\u00a7 167(a). \n \n \n \nSection 203(e) of the Act provides another way in which a normalization method \nof accounting is not being used for public utility property. \n \n \nSection 203(e)(1) of the Act provides that a normalization method of accounting \nshall not be treated as being used with respect to any public utility property for purposes \nof \u00a7 167 or \u00a7 168 if the taxpayer, in computing its cost of service for ratemaking \npurposes and reflecting operating results in its regulated books of account, reduces the \nexcess tax reserve more rapidly or to a greater extent than this reserve would be \nreduced under the average rate assumption method (\u201cARAM\u201d). \n \n \nThe term \u201cexcess tax reserve\u201d is defined in \u00a7 203(e)(2)(A) of the Act as the \nexcess of: \n  \n \n(i) the reserve for deferred taxes as described in former \u00a7 167(l)(3)(G)(ii) or \n \n\u00a7 168(e)(3)(B)(ii) as in effect on the day before the date of the enactment of the   \n \n \nAct, over; \n  \n \n(ii) the amount that would be the balance in this reserve if the amount of the \n \nreserve were determined by assuming that the corporate rate reductions \n \nprovided in the Act were in effect for all prior periods. \n \n \nSection 203(e)(2)(B) of the Act defines the ARAM and explains the calculations \nunder this method.  ARAM is the method under which the excess in the reserve for \ndeferred taxes is reduced over the remaining lives of the property as used in its \nregulated books of account that gave rise to the reserve for deferred taxes.  Under the \n \nPLR-168537-02 \n \n \n8 \nARAM, if timing differences for the property reverse, the amount of the adjustment to \nthe reserve for the deferred taxes is calculated by multiplying: \n  \n \n(i) the ratio of the aggregate deferred taxes for the property to the aggregate \n \ntiming differences for the property as of the beginning of the period in question, \n \nby; \n  \n \n(ii) the amount of the timing differences that reverse during this period. \n \nRev. Proc. 88-12, 1988-1 C.B. 637, provides further guidance as to the \napplication of the ARAM to the excess tax reserve.  Section 2.04 of Rev. Proc. 88-12 \nprovides that under the ARAM, excess tax reserves pertaining to a particular vintage or \nvintage account are not flowed through to ratepayers until such time as the timing \ndifferences in the particular vintage account reverse.  Moreover, it is a violation of \n\u00a7 203(e) of the Act for taxpayers to adopt any accounting treatment that, directly or \nindirectly, circumvents the rule set forth in the previous sentence.  Section 2.04 also \nprovides that \u00a7 203(e) of the Act does not modify the normalization requirements of \nformer \u00a7 167(l) or of \u00a7 168(i). \n \n \nSections 3 and 4.01 of Rev. Proc. 88-12 provide that a taxpayer who lacks \nsufficient vintage account data necessary to apply the ARAM, can use the \"Reverse \nSouth Georgia Method.\"  In general, a taxpayer uses that method if it (a) computes the \nexcess tax reserve on all public utility property included in the plant account on the \nbasis of the weighted average life or composite rate used to compute depreciation for \nregulatory purposes, and (b) reduces the excess tax reserve ratably over the remaining \nregulatory life of the property. \n \n \nFor a public utility to use accelerated depreciation in determining its federal \nincome tax liability, \u00a7 203(e) of the Act requires that normalization accounting be used \nto reduce the excess tax reserve in calculating the rates to be charged the utility's \ncustomers and in maintaining the regulated books of account.  Under \u00a7 203(e) of the \nAct, the immediate flow through of the excess tax reserve to the utility's customers is \nprohibited. Instead, the excess tax reserve is to be reduced and flowed through to cost \nof service no more rapidly that this reserve would be reduced under the ARAM, or, \nwhere appropriate, the Reverse South Georgia Method. \n \n \nSection 203(e) of the Act limits the rate at which the excess tax reserve may be \nreduced and flowed through to the utility's customers in setting rates.  It does not require \nthe utility to flow through the excess tax reserve to its customers, but permits the utility \nto do so provided the reduction to cost of service is not more rapidly than would be \nunder the ARAM.  Thus, \u00a7 203(e) of the Act imposes a limitation on when the excess \ntax reserve may be returned to the utility's customers in the form of reduced rates. \n \n \nIn the present case, Taxpayer has sold the aforementioned public utility property.  \n \nPLR-168537-02 \n \n \n9 \nRetirements of public utility property subject to the normalization requirements of \u00a7 168 \nare reflected in adjustments to Taxpayer's deferred tax reserve as well as its excess tax \nreserve (see \u00a7 1.167(l)-1(h)(2)(i) and Rev. Proc. 88-12, 1988-1 C.B. at 639).  As a result \nof the sale, these reserves cease to exist.  A violation of the depreciation normalization \nrules will occur if there is any return to ratepayers, after the sale date, of the \nunamortized ADFIT or EDFIT attributable to accelerated depreciation on public utility \nproperty that is sold.  Further, both ARAM and the Reverse South Georgia Method rely \non mechanisms requiring a regulatory life.  Once the asset is sold, the regulatory life \nceases to exist. \n \nCONCLUSIONS \n \n \nHence, in each of the three normalization rulings requested by Taxpayer, there \nwould be a normalization violation if the remaining unamortized ADITC, EDFIT and \nADFIT balances (or a proportionate part thereof) existing at the date of sale are \nreturned to ratepayers by amortizing those amounts over the period Taxpayer recovers \nstranded costs from its ratepayers or by decreasing the net loss from the sale of the \nnuclear generating assets by those amounts.  Because Taxpayer has sold the assets \nthat generated the ADITC, the asset for which regulated depreciation expense is \ncomputed is no longer available.  Consequently, no portion of the related unamortized \nADITC remaining at the date of sale may be returned to ratepayers by amortizing those \nADITC amounts over the period Taxpayer recovers stranded costs from its ratepayers \nor by decreasing the net loss from the sale of the nuclear generating assets by those \nADITC amounts.  Additionally, the unamortized ADFIT and EDFIT associated with the \nsold generating assets ceases to exist at the date of sale.  Consequently, a violation of \nthe depreciation normalization rules will occur if there is any return to ratepayers, after \nthe sale date, of those unamortized EDFIT and ADFIT amounts attributable to \naccelerated depreciation on public utility property. \n \n \nThe Service declines to rule on the effective date the nuclear generating assets \nceased to be \u201cpublic utility\u201d property due to the factual nature of the inquiry. \n \nPLR-168537-02 \n \n \n10 \n \nThis ruling is directed only to the taxpayer requesting it.

Specifically, Corporation plans to amend section 4.14 of the \nPlan to provide that, among other things, no ISOs may be granted after 10 years from \nthe date of the adoption of the Plan or the date such plan is approved by the \nstockholders (whichever is earlier). \n \n \nPLR-150521-04 \n \n2 \n \nSection 421(a) of the Code provides that, if a share of stock is transferred to an \nindividual in a transfer in respect of which the requirements of section 422(a) are met, (i) \nno income results to the individual at the time of the transfer of the share to individual on \nexercise of the option; (ii) no deduction under section 162 is allowable at any time to the \nemployer corporation or its parent or subsidiary corporations with respect to the share \ntransferred; and (iii) no amount other than the price paid under the option is considered \nas received by such corporations for the share transferred. \n \n \nSection 422 of the Code provides that section 421 applies to the transfer of stock \nto an individual pursuant to the exercise of an ISO if (i) no disposition of the stock is \nmade by the employee within two years from the date of the grant of the option or within \none year from the date the stock is transferred to the individual; and (ii) at all times \nduring the period beginning on the date the option is granted and ending three months \nbefore the date of its exercise, the optionee was an employee of either the corporation \ngranting the option, a parent or subsidiary of such corporation, or a corporation or a \nparent or subsidiary corporation of such corporation issuing or assuming an option in a \ntransaction to which section 424(a) applies. \n \nSection 422(b)(2) defines an ISO as an option granted to an individual for any \nreason connected with his employment by a corporation, if granted by the employer \ncorporation or its parent or subsidiary corporation, to purchase stock of any of such \ncorporations, but only if, among other requirements, such option is granted within 10 \nyears from the date such plan is adopted, or the date such plan is approved by the \nstockholders, whichever is earlier. \n \nSection 1.422-2(a)(2)(ii) of the Income Tax Regulations provides that to qualify \nas an ISO, an option must be granted within 10 years from the date of the adoption of \nthe plan or the date such plan is approved by the stockholders, whichever is earlier.  In \naddition to this rule, section 1.422-2(c) of the regulations provides that to grant an ISO \nafter the expiration of the 10-year period, a new plan must be adopted and approved. \n \nSection 1.422-2(b)(2)(i) of the regulations provides that the plan must be \napproved by the stockholders of the corporation granting the ISO within 12 months \nbefore or after the date such plan is adopted.  Ordinarily, a plan is adopted when it is \napproved by the granting corporation\u2019s board of directors, and the date of the board\u2019s \naction is the reference point for determining whether the stockholder approval occurs \nwithin the 24-month period.  However, if the board\u2019s action is subject to a condition \n(such as stockholder approval) or the happening of a specific event, the plan is adopted \non the date the condition is met or the event occurs, unless the board\u2019s resolution fixes \nthe date of approval as the date of the board\u2019s action. \n \nSection 1.422-2(b)(2)(iii) of the regulations provides that the provisions relating \nthe maximum aggregate number of shares to be issued under the plan and the \nemployees (or class or classes of employees) eligible to receive options under the plan \nare the only provisions of a stock option plan that, if changed, must be re-approved by \n \nPLR-150521-04 \n \n3 \nstockholders for purposes of section 422(b)(1).  Any increase in the maximum number \nof shares that may be issued under the plan (other than an increase merely reflecting a \nchange in the number of outstanding shares, such as a stock dividend or stock split), or \na change in the designation of the employees (or class or classes of employees) eligible \nto receive options under the plan is considered the adoption of a new plan requiring \nstockholder approval within the prescribed 24-month period. \n \n \nIn this situation, the board adopted, contingent on shareholder approval, an \nincrease in the maximum aggregate number of shares to be issued under the Plan.  \nThis increase was approved by the shareholders on Date 3.  Because an increase in \nthe maximum aggregate number of shares is considered the adoption of a new plan and \nshareholder approval was obtained, the Plan is considered adopted as of Date 3.  ISOs \ngranted within 10 years from the date of the adoption of the Plan or the date such plan \nis approved by the stockholders (whichever is earlier) will satisfy the requirements of \nsection 422(b)(2).   \n \nBased solely on the information submitted, the Date 3 amendment, approved by \nCorporation\u2019s shareholders, results in the deemed re-adoption of the Plan as a new plan \nsuch that options granted under the Plan, at any time within 10 years from the date of \nthe adoption of the Plan, satisfy the 10-year period limitation of section 422(b)(2) of the \nCode. \n \nThe rulings contained in this letter are based upon information and \nrepresentations submitted by the taxpayer and accompanied by a penalty of perjury \nstatement executed by an appropriate party.   While this office has not verified any of \nthe material submitted in support of the request for rulings, it is subject to verification on \nexamination. \n \nExcept as expressly provided herein, no opinion is expressed or implied \nconcerning the tax consequences of any aspect of any transaction or item discussed or \nreferenced in this letter. \n \nThis ruling is directed only to the taxpayer requesting it.

P seeks a confirmation of the rulings in light of the change in membership \ninterests in P, and a potential change in the chemical reagents used to produce \nsynthetic fuel as described in the ruling request. \n \nP is a Delaware limited liability company, taxable as a partnership.  P owns and \noperates two Facilities for producing a solid synthetic fuel from coal (the Product) using \nthe process described below.  The Facilities were constructed by P and P1.  The \nFacilities are Secondary Coal Recovery System #2000 facilities designed by A.  Each \nFacility consists of three production lines each of which consists of a briquetter which is \nfed by its associated mixer and each of which is capable of being operated \nindependently.  Because each production line is capable of being operated \nindependently and can independently produce synthetic fuel, each independent \nproduction line may be treated as a separate facility. \n \nEach Facility was constructed pursuant to a written contract entered into by A and B on \nDate 4.  A assigned to each of P and P1 all of its rights and obligations under the \nconstruction contract with respect to one facility.  On Date 5, B subcontracted with C to \nperform the procurement, assembly and installation services under the construction \ncontract.  P provided an opinion of counsel that the construction contract constituted a \nbinding written contract under applicable state laws prior to January 1, 1997, and at all \ntimes thereafter through completion of the contract. \n \nThe issue regarding when the facilities were placed in service was subject to \nexamination and the issue was reviewed by Appeals.  Following such examination and \nreview, the Service determined, without mutual concessions, that the facilities were \nplaced in service prior to July 1, 1998.  It is the policy of the Internal Revenue Service \nthat such determinations are not reconsidered absent extraordinary circumstances (for \nexample fraud or misrepresentation) and then only with the consent of the Regional \nDirector of Appeals. \n \n \nPLR-112359-04 \n \n \n3 \nP and P1 were originally owned 95% by D and 5% by A.  On Date 6, X purchased an \ninterest in P and P1 from A pursuant to a Purchase Agreement.  S purchased the \nremaining interest in P and P1 from D on Date 7 pursuant to a Purchase Agreement.  \nOn Date 3, P merged with P1, and P became the resulting partnership for federal \nincome tax purposes. \n \nP has relocated the Facilities to a site in Location 1 (the Site).  In connection with the \nrelocation of the Facilities, most major components of each Facility directly necessary to \nproduce a qualified fuel were relocated to the Site.  Certain equipment included in the \noriginal construction was scrapped or sold and not relocated. In connection with the \nrelocation, P also installed certain equipment that is not directly necessary for the \nproduction of qualified fuel such as coal and material handling equipment, a building, \nand an office/maintenance building at the Site.  Following the relocation, the fair market \nvalue of the original property included in each Facility is more than 20 percent of each \nFacility's total value (the cost of the new equipment included in the Facility plus the \nvalue of the original property). \n \nP has entered into a Synthetic Fuel and Coal Supply Agreement with E under which E \nagreed to purchase a minimum of Amount 1 tons of synthetic fuel a year and to use \ncommercially reasonable efforts to purchase up to Amount 2 tons of synthetic fuel a \nyear.  If E does not satisfy its purchase obligation or the production of synthetic fuel \nexceeds E's requirements, P can sell synthetic fuel to third parties.  P has represented \nthat all sales of synthetic fuel will be to unrelated persons. \n \nEffective Date 8, S sold a 49% membership interest in P to Z, a Delaware limited liability \ncompany and wholly-owned subsidiary of Y.  Pursuant to the purchase agreement, Z \npaid $1 million at closing and executed fixed payment and variable payment promissory \nnotes.  P has provided evidence that the net present value of the initial payment and the \nfixed payments exceeds 50% of the total purchase price determined on a net present \nvalue basis. \n \nOn Date 9, Z sold a 49% membership interest in P to T, S sold a 6% membership \ninterest in P to T, and X sold a 4% membership interest in P to T.  For the period from \nthe sale until the transaction on Date 10, discussed below, T owned a 59% membership \ninterest in P, S owned a 40% membership interest in P, and X owned a 1% membership \ninterest in P.  T is a Delaware limited liability company that is wholly-owned by U, and \ndisregarded for federal income tax purposes.   \n \nIn consideration of the membership interest, T paid Amount 3 at closing to the sellers, \nand agreed to pay quarterly fixed and variable payments.  P has provided evidence that \nthe net present value of the initial payment and the fixed payments exceeds 50% of the \ntotal purchase price determined on a net present value basis. \n \n \nPLR-112359-04 \n \n \n4 \nOn Date 10, S sold a 40% membership interest in P to V, a Delaware limited liability \ncompany that is classified as a partnership for federal income tax purposes.  The \nmembers of V are W and W1.  Following the sale, V owns a 40% membership interest \nin P, T owns a 59% membership interest in P, and X owns a 1% membership interest in \nP.   \n \nIn consideration of the membership interest, V paid Amount 4 at closing to S, and \nagreed to pay quarterly fixed and variable payments.  P has provided evidence that the \nnet present value of the initial payment and the fixed payments exceeds 50% of the total \npurchase price determined on a net present value basis.  T, V and X have made (and \nare expected to continue to make) periodic capital contributions to P to enable it to pay \nits operating costs and other obligations.  A proforma attached to the ruling request \ndemonstrates that project expenses are projected to exceed revenues.  \n   \nP has supplied a detailed description of the process employed at the Facilities. P also \nhas proposed that, from time to time, one of six alternative chemical reagents may be \nused in the process for the production of Product.  As described, the Facilities and the \nprocess implemented in the Facilities, including the chemical reagents, meet the \nrequirements of Rev. Proc. 2001-34, 2001-22 I.R.B. 1293. \n \nA recognized expert in coal combustion chemistry has performed numerous tests on the \ncoal used at the Facilities and the Product produced at the Facilities and has submitted \nreports in which the expert concludes that significant chemical changes take place with \nthe application of the process to the coal, including the alternative chemical reagents. P, \nwith use of the process, expects to maintain a level of chemical change in the \nproduction of synthetic fuel that is determined through similar analysis by experts to be \na significant chemical change.  \n \nThe rulings issued in Prior Rulings, which you wish to be reconfirmed in this private \nletter ruling, are as follows: \n  \n1. P, with use of the enumerated process, will produce a \"qualified fuel\" within the \nmeaning of \u00a7 29(c)(1)(C). \n  \n2. The contract for the construction of the Facilities constitutes a \"binding written \ncontract in effect before January 1, 1997\" within the meaning of \u00a7 29(g)(1)(A). \n  \n3. Production from the Facilities will be attributable solely to P within the meaning of \u00a7 \n29(a)(2)(B), and P will be entitled to the \u00a7 29 credit for qualified fuel from the Facilities \nthat is sold to an unrelated person. \n  \n4. The \u00a7 29 credit attributable to P may be allocated to the members of P, presently \nconsisting of V, T, and X, in accordance with the members\u2019 interests in P when the \ncredit arises.  Each such member will take into account its allocated share of the \u00a7 29 \n \nPLR-112359-04 \n \n \n5 \ncredit in computing its tax liability and, for the allocation of the \u00a7 29 credit, a member\u2019s \ninterest in P is determined based on a valid allocation of the receipts from the sale of \nthe \u00a7 29 qualified fuel. \n  \n5. A termination of P under \u00a7 708(b)(1)(B) will not preclude the reconstituted partnership \nfrom claiming the \u00a7 29 credit on the production and sale of synthetic \nfuel to unrelated persons. \n  \n6. Because each Facility was \"placed in service\" prior to July 1, 1998 within the \nmeaning of \u00a7 29(g)(1), relocation of a Facility to a different location after June 30, 1998, \nor replacement of part of a Facility after that date, will not result in a new placed in \nservice date for that Facility for purposes of \u00a7 29 provided the fair market value of the \noriginal property is more than 20 percent of that Facility's total fair market value at the \ntime of relocation or replacement. \n \n7.  Because each Facility was \u201cplaced in service\u201d prior to July 1, 1998 within the \nmeaning of \u00a7 29(g)(1), relocation of one or more of the independent production lines of \na Facility to a new location after June 30, 1998 will not result in a new placed in service \ndate for that Facility or an independent production line for purposes of \u00a7 29 provided all \nessential components of the independent production line are retained and the \nproduction capacity of the independent production line is not significantly increased at \nthe new location. \n \nThe changes in facts since the issuance of Prior Rulings are the changes in \nmembership interests of P, and the potential change in chemical reagents used to \nproduce the synthetic fuel as described in the ruling request. \nRULING REQUESTS #1 AND #3 \nSection 29(a) allows a credit for qualified fuels sold by the taxpayer to an unrelated \nperson during the taxable year, the production of which is attributable to the taxpayer.  \nThe credit for the taxable year is an amount equal to $3.00 (adjusted for inflation) \nmultiplied by the barrel-of-oil equivalent of qualified fuels sold. \nSection 29(c)(1)(C) defines \"qualified fuels\" to include liquid, gaseous, or solid synthetic \nfuels produced from coal (including lignite), including such fuels when used as \nfeedstocks. \nIn Rev. Rul. 86-100, 1986-2 C.B. 3, the Internal Revenue Service ruled that the \ndefinition of the term \"synthetic fuel\" under \u00a7 48(l) and its regulations are relevant to the \ninterpretation of the term under \u00a7 29(c)(1)(C).  Former \u00a7 48(l)(3)(A)(iii) provided a credit \nfor the cost of equipment used for converting an alternate substance into a synthetic \nliquid, gaseous, or solid fuel. Rev. Rul. 86-100 notes that both \u00a7 29 and former \u00a7 48(l) \ncontain almost identical language and have the same overall congressional intent, \n \nPLR-112359-04 \n \n \n6 \nnamely to encourage energy conservation and aid development of domestic energy \nproduction.  Under \u00a7 1.48-9(c)(5)(ii) of the Income Tax Regulations, a synthetic fuel \n\"differs significantly in chemical composition,\" as opposed to physical composition, from \nthe alternate substance used to produce it.  Coal is an alternate substance under \u00a7 \n1.48-9(c)(2)(i). \nConsistent with its private letter ruling practice that began in the mid 1990\u2019s, the \nService, in Rev. Proc. 2001-30, provided that taxpayers must satisfy certain conditions \nin order to obtain a letter ruling that a solid fuel (other than coke) produced from coal is \na qualified fuel under \u00a7 29(c)(1)(C).  Rev. Proc. 2001-30, as modified by Rev. Proc. \n2001-34, 2001-1 C.B. 1293.  The revenue procedure requires taxpayers to present \nevidence that all, or substantially all, of the coal used as feedstock undergoes a \nsignificant chemical change.  To meet this requirement and obtain favorable private \nletter rulings, taxpayers provided expert reports asserting that their processes resulted \nin a significant chemical change. \nIn Announcement 2003-46, 2003-30 I.R.B. 222, the Service announced that it was \nreviewing the scientific validity of test procedures and results presented of significant \nchemical change in expert reports.  In Announcement 2003-70, 2003-46 I.R.B. 1090, \nthe Service announced that it had determined that the test procedures and results used \nby taxpayers were scientifically valid if the procedures were applied in a consistent and \nunbiased manner.  However, the Service concluded that the processes approved under \nits long standing ruling practice and as set forth in Rev. Proc. 2001-30 did not produce \nthe level of chemical change required by \u00a7 29(c)(1)(C).  Nevertheless, the Service \nannounced that it recognized that many taxpayers and their investors have relied on its \nlong standing ruling practice to make investments.  Therefore, the Service announced \nthat it would continue to issue rulings on significant chemical change but only under the \nguidelines set forth in Rev. Proc. 2001-30, as modified by Rev. Proc. 2001-34. \nThis ruling is provided to P and its members consistent with Announcement 2003-70 \nand the Service\u2019s long standing ruling practice.  Accordingly, based on the expert test \nresults submitted by P, T and V, we conclude that P, T and V, with use of the described \nprocess and specified chemical reagents, will produce a solid synthetic fuel from coal \nconstituting a \u201cqualified fuel\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 29(c)(1)(C).  Because P owns the \nFacilities and operates and maintains the Facilities through its agent, we conclude that \nP will be entitled to the \u00a7 29 credit for the production of the qualified fuel from the \nFacilities that is sold to an unrelated person.  \nRULING REQUEST #2 \nSections 29(f)(1)(B) and (f)(2) provide that \u00a7 29 applies with respect to qualified fuels \nwhich are produced in a facility placed-in-service after December 31, 1979, and before \nJanuary 1, 1993, and which are sold before January 1, 2003. \n \nPLR-112359-04 \n \n \n7 \nSection 29(g)(1) modifies \u00a7 29(f) in the case of a facility producing qualified fuels \ndescribed in \u00a7 29(c)(1)(C).  Section 29(g)(1)(A) provides that for purposes of \u00a7 \n29(f)(1)(B), a facility shall be treated as placed-in-service before January 1, 1993, if the \nfacility is placed-in-service before July 1, 1998, pursuant to a binding written contract in \neffect before January 1, 1997.  Section 29(g)(1)(B) provides that if the facility is \noriginally placed-in-service after December 31, 1992, \u00a7 29(f)(2) shall be applied by \nsubstituting \"January 1, 2008\" for \"January 1, 2003\". \nA contract is binding only if it is enforceable under local law against a taxpayer, and \ndoes not limit damages to a specified amount, e.g., by use of a liquidated damages \nprovision.  A contract provision limiting damages to an amount equal to at least five \npercent of the total contract price, for example, should be treated as not limiting \ndamages.  The construction contract, executed prior to January 1, 1997, includes such \nfeatures as a description of the facility to be constructed, a completion date, and a \nmaximum price.  The contract also provides that damages shall not be less than six \npercent of the total contract price.  P provided an opinion of counsel that the contract is \nbinding under applicable law.  Therefore, the contract is a binding written contract for \npurposes of \u00a7 29(g)(1). \nRULING REQUEST #4 \nSection 29(a) allows a credit for qualified fuels sold by the taxpayer to an unrelated \nperson during the taxable year, the production of which is attributable to the taxpayer. \nSection 7701(a)(14) provides that \"taxpayer\" means any person subject to any internal \nrevenue tax.  Generally, under \u00a7 7701(a)(1), the term \"person\" includes an individual, a \ntrust, estate, partnership, association, company, or corporation. \nSection 702(a)(7) provides that each partner determines the partner's income tax by \ntaking into account separately the partner\u2019s distributive share of the partnership's other \nitems of income, gain, loss, deduction, or credit to the extent provided by regulations \nprescribed by the Secretary.  Section 1.702-1(a) provides that the distributive share is \ndetermined as provided in \u00a7 704 and \u00a7 1.704-1. \nSection 704(a) provides that a partner's distributive share of income, gain, loss, \ndeduction, or credit is, except as otherwise provided in chapter 1 of subtitle A of title 26, \ndetermined by the partnership agreement. \nSection 704(b) provides that a partner's distributive share of income, gain, loss, \ndeduction, or credit (or item thereof) is determined in accordance with the partner\u2019s \ninterest in the partnership (determined by taking into account all facts and \ncircumstances) if (1) the partnership agreement does not provide as to the partner\u2019s \ndistributive share of income, gain, loss, deduction, or credit (or item thereof), or (2) the \n \nPLR-112359-04 \n \n \n8 \nallocation to a partner under the agreement of income, gain, loss, deduction, or credit \n(or item thereof) does not have substantial economic effect. \nSection 1.704-1(b)(4)(ii) provides that allocations of tax credits and tax credit recapture \n(except for \u00a7 38 property) are not reflected by adjustments to the partners' capital \naccounts.  Thus, these allocations cannot have economic effect under \u00a7 1.704-\n1(b)(2)(ii)(b)(1), and the tax credits and tax credit recapture must be allocated in \naccordance with the partners' interests in the partnership as of the time the tax credit or \ncredit recapture arises.  If a partnership expenditure (whether or not deductible) that \ngives rise to a tax credit in a partnership tax year also gives rise to valid allocations of \npartnership loss or deduction (or other downward capital account adjustments) for the \nyear, then the partners' interests in the partnership with respect to such credit (or the \ncost giving rise to it) are in the same proportion as the partners' respective distributive \nshares of the loss or deduction (and adjustments).  See \u00a7 1.704-1(b)(5), example (11).  \nIdentical principles apply in determining the partners' interests in the partnership with \nrespect to tax credits that arise from receipts of the partnership (whether or not taxable). \nBased on the information submitted and the representations made, we conclude that \nthe \u00a7 29 credit attributable to P may be allocated to the members of P in accordance \nwith the members' interests in P when the credit arises.  For the allocation of the \u00a7 29 \ncredit, a member's interest in P is determined based on a valid allocation of the receipts \nfrom the sale of the \u00a7 29 qualified fuel. \nRULING REQUEST #5 \nSection 708(b)(1)(B) provides that a partnership shall be considered as terminated if \nwithin a twelve-month period there is a sale or exchange of 50 percent or more of the \ntotal interest in partnership capital and profits. \nSection 1.708-1(b)(1)(iv) provides that if a partnership is terminated by a sale or \nexchange of an interest, the following is deemed to occur: The partnership contributes \nall of its assets and liabilities to a new partnership in exchange for an interest in the new \npartnership; and, immediately thereafter, the terminated partnership distributes interests \nin the new partnership to the purchasing partner and the other remaining partners in \nproportion to their respective interests in the terminated partnership in liquidation of the \nterminated partnership, either for the continuation of the business by the new \npartnership or for its dissolution and winding up.  Section 1.708-1(b)(1)(iv) applies to \nterminations of partnerships under \u00a7 708(b)(1)(B) occurring on or after May 9, 1997. \nAs discussed above, the placed-in-service deadline in \u00a7\u00a7 29(f)(1)(B) and 29(g)(1)(A) \nmust be read as applying to when the facility is first placed in service within the \napplicable dates.  The placed-in-service deadlines contained in \u00a7\u00a7 29(f)(1)(B) and \n29(g)(1)(A) focus on the facility, and not the taxpayer owning the facility. \n \nPLR-112359-04 \n \n \n9 \nAccordingly, the determination of whether a facility has satisfied the placed-in-service \ndeadline under \u00a7\u00a7 29(f)(1)(B) and 29(g)(1)(A) is made by reference to when the facility \nis first placed in service, not when the facility is placed in service by a transferee \ntaxpayer.  Therefore, we conclude that a termination of P under \u00a7 708(b)(1)(B) will not \npreclude the reconstituted partnership from claiming the \u00a7 29 credit on the production \nand sale of synthetic fuel to unrelated persons. \nRULING REQUEST #6 \nTo qualify for the \u00a7 29 credit, P's facility must be placed-in-service before July 1, 1998, \npursuant to a binding written contract in effect before January 1, 1997.  While \u00a7 29 does \nnot define \"placed-in-service,\" the term has been defined for purposes of the deduction \nfor depreciation and the investment tax credit.  Property is \"placed-in-service\" in the \ntaxable year the property is placed in a condition or state of readiness and availability \nfor a specifically assigned function. Treas. Reg. \u00a7\u00a7 1.167(a)-11(e)(1)(i) and 1.46-\n3(d)(1)(ii).  \"Placed in service\" has consistently been construed as having the same \nmeaning for purposes of the deduction for depreciation and the investment tax credit. \nSee Rev. Rul. 76-256, 1976-2 C.B. 46.  As discussed above, the Service made a \ndetermination that the Facilities were placed in service prior to July 1, 1998. \nRev. Rul. 94-31, 1994-1 C.B. 16, concerns \u00a7 45, which provides a credit for electricity \nproduced from certain renewable resources, including wind.  The credit is based on the \namount of electricity produced by the taxpayer at a qualified facility during the 10-year \nperiod beginning on the date the facility was originally placed in service, and sold by the \ntaxpayer to an unrelated person during the taxable year.  Rev. Rul. 94-31 holds that, for \npurposes of \u00a7 45, a facility qualifies as originally placed in service even though it \ncontains some used property, provided the fair market value of the used property is not \nmore than 20 percent of the facility's total value (the cost of the new property included in \nthe facility plus the value of the used property). \nRev. Rul. 94-31 describes a windfarm that consists of an \u201carray of wind turbines, towers, \npads, transformers, roadways, fencing, on-site power collection systems, and \nmonitoring and meteorological equipment.\u201d  Notwithstanding that the windfarm \nconsisted of all of these items, the ruling concludes that the \u201cfacility\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 \n45 is confined to \u201cthe property on the windfarm necessary for the production of \nelectricity from wind energy.\u201d (emphasis added.)  The present situation is similar to  \nRev. Rul. 94-31.  Thus, for purposes of determining the Facility\u2019s total fair market value \nat the time of relocation or replacement, the Facility consists of the process equipment \ndirectly necessary for the production of the qualified fuel, starting at the immediate input \nof the coal and chemical reagents to the pug mills or mixers (including any coal hoppers \nand reagent tanks directly feeding the pug mills or mixers) through the output from the \nbriquetters or other forming equipment (including output hoppers, if any).  Hence, the \nFacility\u2019s total fair market value includes the process equipment such as pugmills or \nmixers, the briquetters or other forming equipment, the equipment necessary to \n \nPLR-112359-04 \n \n \n10 \ninterconnect such equipment, the electrical, instrumentation, control systems and \nauxiliaries related to such equipment (including the structures that house such electrical, \ninstrumentation and control systems), the foundation platform(s) for the above-\nreferenced equipment, and an appropriate allocation of the engineering, project \nmanagement, overhead, and other costs assignable to the relocation of such equipment \nand construction.  The Facility\u2019s total fair market value does not include costs \nassociated with the purchase and installation of equipment that supports the operation \nof the Facility but is not directly necessary for the production of the qualified fuel, such \nas coal beneficiation, or preparation equipment (e.g., crushers, screens, dryers, or \nscales), other material handling or conveying equipment (e.g., stacking tubes, transfer \ntowers, storage bunkers, mobile equipment, or conveyors), certain site improvements \n(e.g., fencing, lighting, earthwork, paving), separate office and bathhouse trailers for \nfacility personnel, and buildings (if a \u201cbuilding\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 168 of the Code). \nSampling and quality control are necessary for operational control of a production \nfacility.  However, a particular type of sampling equipment generally is not necessary for \nthe production of qualified fuel.  Thus, the costs of sampling equipment are excluded \nfrom the Facility\u2019s total fair market value unless the particular sampling equipment is \nnecessary for operational control of the facility. \nConsistent with the holding in Rev. Rul. 94-31, because P's Facilities were \"placed in \nservice\" prior to July 1, 1998, within the meaning of \u00a7 29(g)(1), relocation of the Facility \nto a different location, or replacement of part of the Facility after June 30, 1998, will not \nresult in a new placed in service date for the Facility for purposes of \u00a7 29 provided the \nfair market value of the original property is more than 20 percent of the Facility's total \nfair market value at the time of relocation or replacement (the cost of the new equipment \nincluded in the Facility plus the value of the used property). \nRULING REQUEST #7 \n \nRevenue Procedure 2001-30, 2001-19 I.R.B. 1163, provides that \"a facility (including \none of multiple facilities located at the same site) may be relocated without affecting the \navailability of the credit if all essential components of the facility are retained and the \nproduction capacity of the relocated facility is not significantly increased at the new \nlocation.\" \n \nP has represented that each of the Facilities are designed with three separate and \nindependent production lines so that each line can be operated as a separate unit to \nproduce synthetic fuel.  P has represented that all of the major components of the \nproduction line would be relocated if the production line is relocated to a new site.  P \nhas also represented that relocation of one or more production lines to another site \nwould require the duplication of relatively minor components, and site specific items \ninvolved in the relocation of any facility, such as site preparation, paving, foundations, \narea lighting, and utilities. \n \nPLR-112359-04 \n \n \n11 \n \nBased on the information submitted and the representations made, we conclude that P \nmay relocate one or more of the independent production lines provided the major or \nessential components of the independent production line are retained and the \n\"production output\" of the relocated production line is not significantly increased at the \nnew location.  The \"production output\" is the amount of qualified fuel (including the \nproduction of a briquetted fuel product) that can reasonably be expected to be actually \nproduced by each facility using the prevailing practices in the industry regarding the \nperformance of maintenance with regard to the various pieces of equipment in the \nfacility, reasonable allowances for shutdowns for repairs and/or replacement of parts, \netc. \nCONCLUSIONS \nAccordingly, we re-issue the rulings given in Prior Rulings, and conclude as follows: \n \n1. P, with use of the enumerated process and specified chemical reagents, will \nproduce a \u201cqualified fuel\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 29(c)(1)(C). \n \n2. The contract for the construction of the Facilities constitutes a \"binding written \ncontract in effect before January 1, 1997\" within the meaning of \u00a7 29(g)(1)(A). \n  \n \n3. Production from the Facilities will be attributable solely to P within the meaning \nof \u00a7 29(a)(2)(B), and P will be entitled to the \u00a7 29 credit for qualified fuel from the \nFacilities that is sold to an unrelated person. \n  \n \n4. The \u00a7 29 credit attributable to P may be allocated to the members of P, \npresently consisting of V, T, and X, in accordance with the members\u2019 interests in P \nwhen the credit arises.  Each such member will take into account its allocated share of \nthe \u00a7 29 credit in computing its tax liability and, for the allocation of the \u00a7 29 credit, a \nmember\u2019s interest in P is determined based on a valid allocation of the receipts from the \nsale of the \u00a7 29 qualified fuel. \n  \n \n5. A termination of P under \u00a7 708(b)(1)(B) will not preclude the reconstituted \npartnership from claiming the \u00a7 29 credit on the production and sale of synthetic fuel to \nunrelated persons. \n  \n \n6. Because each Facility was \"placed in service\" prior to July 1, 1998 within the \nmeaning of \u00a7 29(g)(1), relocation of a Facility to a different location after June 30, 1998, \nor replacement of part of a Facility after that date, will not result in a new placed in \nservice date for that Facility for purposes of \u00a7 29 provided the fair market value of the \noriginal property is more than 20 percent of that Facility's total fair market value at the \ntime of relocation or replacement. \n \n \nPLR-112359-04 \n \n \n12 \n \n7.  Because each Facility was \u201cplaced in service\u201d prior to July 1, 1998 within the \nmeaning of \u00a7 29(g)(1), relocation of one or more of the independent production lines of \na Facility to a new location after June 30, 1998 will not result in a new placed in service \ndate for that Facility or an independent production line for purposes of \u00a7 29 provided all \nessential components of the independent production line are retained and the \nproduction capacity of the independent production line is not significantly increased at \nthe new location. \n \nThe conclusions drawn and rulings given in this letter are subject to the requirements \nthat the taxpayer (i) maintain sampling and quality control procedures that conform to \nASTM or other appropriate industry guidelines at the facility that is the subject of this \nletter, (ii) obtain regular reports from independent laboratories that have analyzed the \nfuel produced in such facility to verify that the coal used to produce the fuel undergoes a \nsignificant chemical change, and (iii) maintain records and data underlying the reports \nthat taxpayer obtains from independent laboratories including raw FTIR data and \nprocessed FTIR data sufficient to document the selection of absorption peaks and \nintegration points. \nExcept as specifically ruled upon above, we express no opinion concerning the federal \nincome tax consequences of the transaction described above. \nThis ruling is directed only to the taxpayer who requested it.  Section 6110(k)(3) \nprovides that it may not be used or cited as precedent.  Temporary or final regulations \npertaining to one or more of the issues addressed in this ruling have not yet been \nadopted.  Therefore, this ruling may be modified or revoked by the adoption of \ntemporary or final regulations to the extent the regulations are inconsistent with any \nconclusion in this ruling.  See \u00a7 12.04 of Rev. Proc. 2003-1, 2003-1 I.R.B. 1.  However, \nwhen the criteria in \u00a7 12.05 of Rev.

This letter addresses your \nrequested rulings under sections 83 and 424 of the Code.  A related letter was issued \nPLR-144008-07\n2\non Date X.  The facts, as represented in your original and supplemental submissions, \nare set forth below.  The transaction (Transaction) described in the submissions was \ncompleted on Date Y.\nAs described in the submissions, Corporation was a publicly-held company and \nthe common parent of an affiliated group of corporations filing a consolidated Federal \nincome tax return.  Corporation was directly engaged in Business A and Business B.  \nCorporation had one class of common stock outstanding.  The purpose of the \nTransaction was to separate, for valid business reasons, the two business lines in a \nspin-off transaction.  \nDistributing, Controlled, Distributing LLC and Controlled LLC were newly formed \nfor purposes of the Transaction.  Distributing had one class of common stock, all of \nwhich was held by Corporation.  Controlled had one class of common stock, all of which \nwas held by Distributing.  All of the membership interests of Distributing LLC were held \nby Corporation and all of the membership interests of Controlled LLC were held by \nDistributing.  Distributing LLC and Controlled LLC were disregarded as entities separate \nfrom their owners for Federal income tax purposes.  \nPursuant to the Transaction, Corporation merged with and into Controlled LLC \nwith Controlled LLC surviving the merger.  In the merger, each share of Corporation \ncommon stock was exchanged for one share of Distributing common stock.  Following \nthe merger, Controlled LLC contributed Business A to Distributing LLC and distributed \nall of its interests in Distributing LLC to Distributing.  Distributing then transferred all of \nits interests in Controlled LLC to Controlled.  Following such transfers of interests, \nDistributing LLC incurred certain indebtedness from third party sources and contributed \na portion of the proceeds to Distributing.  Distributing contributed a portion of such \nproceeds to Controlled, then distributed, pro rata, all of the common stock of Controlled \nto holders of record of Distributing common stock (Share Distribution).  After the \nforgoing, Distributing owned Business A and Controlled owned Business B, with \nemployees of Business A being employees of Distributing and employees of Business B \nbeing employees of Controlled.  With one exception, each director of Corporation \nbecame a director of either Distributing or Controlled.  One director of Corporation \nbecame a director of both corporations.  \nPrior to the Transaction, Corporation maintained the Stock Option Plan and the \nStock Incentive Plan.  Pursuant to the Stock Option Plan and the Stock Incentive Plan, \nCorporation granted certain of its employees and directors options to purchase shares \nof Corporation\u2019s common stock.  As a result of the Transaction, each incentive stock \noption (Corporation ISO) and non-statutory option (Corporation Non-Statutory Option) \nheld by an employee or director immediately before the Share Distribution was \nconverted into a corresponding incentive stock option or non-statutory stock option to \nacquire either Distributing common stock (Distributing ISOs or Non-Statutory Stock \nOptions, as applicable) or Controlled common stock (Controlled ISOs or Non-Statutory \nPLR-144008-07\n3\nStock Options, as applicable).  Consequently, employees and directors of Distributing \nreceived Distributing ISOs or Non-Statutory Options (collectively Distributing Options) \nand employees and directors of Controlled received Controlled ISOs or Non-Statutory \nOptions (collectively Controlled Options).  Each Distributing or Controlled Option \nreceived as a result of the Transaction had the same terms and conditions as the \ncorresponding Corporation ISOs and Non-Statutory Options (collectively Corporation \nOptions), except that appropriate adjustments were made by reason of the Transaction.\nCorporation makes the following representations.  None of the Corporation Non-\nStatutory Options had a readily ascertainable fair market value within the meaning of \nsection 1.83-7(b) of the Income Tax Regulations (Regulations) at the time the options \nwere granted.  None of the Distributing or Controlled Non-Statutory Options had a \nreadily ascertainable fair market value within the meaning of section 1.83-7(b) of the \nRegulations at the time the options were granted.  The conversion of Corporation ISOs \nto Distributing and Controlled ISOs, as described above, was consistent with section \n424 of the Code and Regulations issued thereunder, and Corporation specifically \nrepresents that the requirements of section 1.424-1(a) of the Regulations are satisfied.  \nPursuant to a tax allocation agreement, Distributing and Controlled will each only claim \na deduction for compensation income recognized by its own employees and directors.\nSection 83(a) of the Code provides that if, in connection with the performance of \nservices, property is transferred to any person other than the person for whom such \nservices are performed, the excess of (1) the fair market value of such property \n(determined without regard to any restriction other than a restriction that by its terms will \nnever lapse) at the first time the rights of the person having the beneficial interest in \nsuch property are transferable or are not subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture, \nwhichever occurs earlier, over (2) the amount (if any) paid for such property, shall be \nincluded in the gross income of the person who performed such services in the first \ntaxable year in which the rights of the person having the beneficial interest in such \nproperty are transferable or are not subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture, whichever \nis applicable.\nSection 83(g) of the Code provides that if property to which section 83(a) applies \nis exchanged for property subject to restrictions and conditions substantially similar to \nthose to which the property given in such exchange was subject, and if section 354, \n355, 356, or 1036 (or so much of section 1031 as relates to section 1036) applied to \nsuch exchange, or if such exchange was pursuant to the exercise of a conversion \nprivilege, (1) such exchange shall be disregarded for purposes of section 83(a), and (2) \nthe property received shall be treated as property to which subsection (a) applies.\nSection 83(h) of the Code provides that, in the case of a transfer of property to \nwhich section 83 applies, there shall be allowed as a deduction under section 162, to \nthe person for whom were performed the services in connection with which such \nproperty was transferred, an amount equal to the amount included under subsection (a), \nPLR-144008-07\n4\n(b) or (d)(2) in the gross income of the person who performed such services.  Such \ndeduction shall be allowed for the taxable year of such person in which or with which \nends the taxable year in which such amount is included in the gross income of the \nperson who performed such services.  Section 3.01(6) of Revenue Procedure 2007-3 \nprovides that the Internal Revenue Service will not issue a letter ruling regarding which \ncorporation is entitled to the deduction under section 83(h) of the Code in cases where \na corporation undergoes a corporate division if the facts are not similar to those \ndescribed in Revenue Ruling 2002-1, 2002-2 I.R.B 268.   \nSection 1.83-1(b)(1) of the Regulations provides that if substantially nonvested \nproperty is subsequently sold or otherwise disposed of to a third party in an arm\u2019s length \ntransaction while still substantially nonvested, the person who performed the such \nservices shall realize compensation in an amount equal to the excess of (1) the amount \nrealized on such sale or other disposition, over (2) the amount (if any) paid for such \nproperty.  Under section 1.83-1(b)(3) of the Regulations, section 1.83-1(b)(1) shall not \napply to, and no gain shall be recognized on, any sale, forfeiture or other disposition to \nthe extent that any property received in exchange therefore is substantially nonvested.  \nInstead, section 83 of the Code and section 1.83-1 of the Regulations shall apply with \nrespect to such property received (as if it were substituted for the property disposed of). \nSection 1.83-7 of the Regulations provides that, if there is granted to an \nemployee or independent contractor in connection with the performance of services, an \noption to which section 421 of the Code does not apply, section 83(a) of the Code shall \napply to such grant if the option has a readily ascertainable fair market value at the time \nthe option is granted.  The person who performed such services realizes compensation \nupon such grant at the time and in the amount determined under section 83(a) of the \nCode.  If section 83(a) of the Code does not apply to the grant of such an option \nbecause the option does not have a readily ascertainable fair market value at the time \nof grant, sections 83(a) and (b) of the Code shall apply at the time the option is \nexercised or otherwise disposed of, even though the fair market value of such option \nmay have become readily ascertainable before such time.  If the option is exercised, \nsections 83(a) and (b) of the Code apply to the transfer of property pursuant to such \nexercise, and the employee or independent contractor realizes compensation upon \nsuch transfer at the time and in the amount determined under sections 83(a) and (b) of \nthe Code.  If the option is sold or otherwise disposed of in an arm\u2019s length transaction, \nsections 83(a) and (b) of the Code apply to the transfer of money or other property \nreceived in the same manner as those sections would have applied to the transfer of \nproperty pursuant to an exercise of the option.\nSection 424(a) of the Code provides that the term \"issuing or assuming a stock \noption in a transaction to which section 424(a) applies\" means a substitution of a new \noption for the old option, or an assumption of the old option, by an employer \ncorporation, or a parent or subsidiary of such corporation, by reason of a corporate \nmerger, consolidation, acquisition of property or stock, separation reorganization or \nPLR-144008-07\n5\nliquidation, if (1) the excess of the aggregate fair market value of the shares subject to \nthe option immediately after the substitution or assumption over the aggregate option \nprice of such shares is not more than the excess of the aggregate fair market value of \nall shares subject to the option immediately before such substitution or assumption over \nthe aggregate option price of such shares, and (2) the new option or the assumption of \nthe old option does not give the employee additional benefits which he did not have \nunder the old option.\nSection 424(h)(1) of the Code provides that if the terms of any option to purchase \nstock are modified, extended or renewed, such modification, extension or renewal shall \nbe considered the granting of a new option.\nSection 424(h)(3) of the Code provides, in part, that the term \"modification\" \nmeans any change in the terms of the option that gives the employee additional benefits \nunder the option, but such terms shall not include a change in the terms of the option \nattributable to the issuance or assumption of an option under section 424(a). \nSection 1.424-1(a) of the Regulations provides rules under which an eligible \ncorporation may, by reason of a corporate transaction, substitute a new statutory option \n(new option) for an outstanding statutory option (old option) or assume an old option \nwithout such substitution or assumption being considered a modification of the old \noption.  \nUnder section 1.424-1(a)(2) of the Regulations, the term \u201celigible corporation\u201d \nmeans a corporation that is the employer of the optionee or a related corporation of \nsuch corporation. The determination of whether a corporation is the employer of the \noptionee or a related corporation of such corporation is based upon all of the relevant \nfacts and circumstances existing immediately after the corporate transaction.  \nUnder section 1.424-1(a)(3) of the Regulations, the term \u201ccorporate transaction\u201d \nincludes: (i) a corporate merger, consolidation, acquisition of property or stock, \nseparation, reorganization or liquidation; (ii) a distribution (excluding an ordinary \ndividend or a stock split or stock dividend described in section 1.424-1(e)(4)(v) of the \nRegulations) or change in the terms or number of outstanding shares of such \ncorporation; and (iii) such other corporate events prescribed by the Commissioner in \npublished guidance.\nSection 1.424-1(a)(4) of the Regulations provides that, for a change in an option \nor issuance of a new option to qualify as a substitution or assumption, the change must \nbe made by an eligible corporation and occur by reason of a corporate transaction.  \nSection 1.424-1(a)(4) of the Regulations further provides that, generally, a change in an \noption or issuance of a new option is considered to be by reason of a corporate \ntransaction, unless the relevant facts and circumstances demonstrate that such change \nor issuance is made for reasons unrelated to such corporate transaction.\nPLR-144008-07\n6\nPursuant to section 1.424-1(a)(5) of the Regulations, for a change in an option or \nissuance of a new option to qualify as a substitution or assumption, the following \nrequirements must be met:\n(i) \nIn the case of an issuance of a new option (or portion thereof) in exchange \nfor an old option (or portion thereof), the optionee's rights under the old option (or \nportion thereof) must be canceled, and the optionee must lose all rights under the old\noption (or portion thereof). There cannot be a substitution of a new option for an old \noption within the meaning of section 1.424-1(a) of the Regulations if the optionee may \nexercise both the old option and the new option. It is not necessary to have a complete \nsubstitution of a new option for the old option. However, any portion of such option \nwhich is not substituted or assumed in a transaction to which section 1.424-1(a) of the \nRegulations applies is an outstanding option to purchase stock or, to the extent section \n1.424-1(e) of the Regulations applies, a modified option.\n(ii) \nThe excess of the aggregate fair market value of the shares subject to the \nnew or assumed option immediately after the change in the option or issuance of a new \noption over the aggregate option price of such shares must not exceed the excess of \nthe aggregate fair market value of all shares subject to the old option (or portion thereof) \nimmediately before the change in the option or issuance of a new option over the \naggregate option price of such shares.\n(iii) \nOn a share by share comparison, the ratio of the option price to the fair \nmarket value of the shares subject to the option immediately after the change in the \noption or issuance of a new option must not be more favorable to the optionee than the \nratio of the option price to the fair market value of the stock subject to the old option (or \nportion thereof) immediately before the change in the option or issuance of a new \noption. The number of shares subject to the new or assumed option may be adjusted to \ncompensate for any change in the aggregate spread between the aggregate option \nprice and the aggregate fair market value of the shares subject to the option \nimmediately after the change in the option or issuance of the new option as compared \nto the aggregate spread between the option price and the aggregate fair market value of \nthe shares subject to the option immediately before the change in the option or issuance \nof the new option.\n(iv) \nThe new or assumed option must contain all terms of the old option, \nexcept to the extent such terms are rendered inoperative by reason of the corporate \ntransaction.\n(v) \nThe new option or assumed option must not give the optionee additional \nbenefits that the optionee did not have under the old option.\nBased on the information submitted, we rule that:\nPLR-144008-07\n7\n1. \nSection 83 of the Code does not apply to the Distributing or Controlled Non-\nStatutory Options that the holders of Corporation Non-Statutory Options received \npursuant to the Share Distribution because those options did not have a readily \nascertainable fair market value on the date the Share Distribution occurred.  Section 83 \nwill apply when those options are exercised or otherwise disposed of.  \n2.\nThe exchange of Corporation ISOs for Distributing or Controlled ISOs pursuant to \nthe Share Distribution will not constitute a modification, extension or renewal of these \nincentive stock options within the meaning of section 424(h)(3) of the Code, and \ntherefore will not constitute the grant of new options for purposes of section 424 of the \nCode.\n3.   \nProvided the requirements of section 162 of the Code are satisfied, in the event \nthat amounts are includible in the gross income of a holder of Distributing or Controlled \nOptions under section 83 of the Code as a result of the exercise of such options, \nDistributing will be entitled to a corresponding deduction pursuant to section 83(h) of the \nCode if the employee was employed by or the director was a director of Distributing or a \nsubsidiary of Distributing from the date the option was granted through the date of \nexercise (or any earlier termination of employment, where applicable), and Controlled \nwill be entitled to a corresponding deduction pursuant to section 83(h) of the Code if the \nemployee was employed by or the director was a director of Controlled or a subsidiary \nof Controlled from the date the option was granted through the date of exercise (or any \nearlier termination of employment, where applicable).  \nExcept as specifically ruled on above, no opinion is expressed or implied \nconcerning the tax consequences of any aspect of any transaction or item discussed or \nreferenced in this letter.  In particular, no opinion is expressed or implied regarding the \nqualification of the options under section 422 of the Code.  Further, no opinion is \nexpressed or implied regarding section 409A of the Code.  This ruling is directed only to \nthe taxpayer who requested it.

Taxpayer uses the cash method of accounting \nand is a calendar year taxpayer.  Taxpayer contracted with X to purchase and install a \nresidential alternative renewable energy system at Taxpayer\u2019s residence.  \nPLR-102696-10\n2\nUnder the State Program, retail public electric utility companies (\u201cUtilities\u201d or \n\u201cUtility\u201d) such as Public Utility are required to generate an increasing portion of their \nretail electricity sales from renewable sources (\u201cAnnual Renewable Energy \nRequirement\u201d).  A portion of the Annual Renewable Energy Requirement must be met \nwith Renewable Energy Credits (\u201cRECs\u201d), which are derived from distributed residential \nand non-residential applications.  RECs are tradable commodities that represent proof \nthat one kilowatt-hour (\u201ckWh\u201d) of electricity is generated from a renewable energy \nsource.  RECs expire once a Utility uses the RECs to satisfy the Annual Renewable \nEnergy Requirement.  Utilities may transfer or purchase RECs from third parties to meet \nthe requirements imposed by the Program.  \nMost Utilities have established renewable energy incentive programs to satisfy \nthe requirements of the Program.  The incentive programs typically offer residential \ncustomers, who install renewable energy resources, the opportunity to sell RECs \nassociated with their renewable installations back to the Utility for an up-front incentive \npayment based on an amount of residential solar generating capacity.  \nIn Year, Taxpayer purchased a grid-tied solar electric power system (\u201cResidential \nSolar System\u201d) from X for $a that allows Taxpayer to convert sunlight into utility grade \nelectricity.  The Residential Solar System will generate electricity for Taxpayer\u2019s \nresidence.  Taxpayer is a participant in Public Utility\u2019s renewable energy incentive \nprogram whereby Taxpayer has agreed to transfer title and ownership of any \n\u201cenvironmental credits, benefits, emissions reductions, offsets and allowances\u201d \nassociated with each kWh of electricity produced by Taxpayer\u2019s Residential Solar \nSystem to Public Utility for a b year term in exchange for a one-time payment of $c \n(\u201cREC Payment\u201d).  Public Utility is not purchasing the Residential Solar System from \nTaxpayer but is purchasing the RECs associated with that system.   \nTaxpayer does not expect to reduce the amount of expenditure made for the \nResidential Solar System by the REC Payment; Taxpayer plans to calculate the tax \ncredit on the full purchase price.  Thus, Taxpayer expects to report on Taxpayer\u2019s \nfederal income tax return for Year an income tax credit of $d pursuant to \u00a7 25D(a)(1).  \nAccordingly, you requested the following rulings:\n1.  Taxpayer will be able to obtain an income tax credit pursuant to \u00a7 25D for \nYear in the amount $d (30% of $a) with no reduction for the receipt of the REC \npayment;\n2. The REC payment shall not be treated as a subsidy provided (directly or \nindirectly) by a public utility to a customer for the purchase or installation of any energy \nconservation measure as described in \u00a7 136(a); and \nPLR-102696-10\n3\n3.  The Taxpayer shall be required to treat the REC payment as gross income \npursuant to \u00a7 61(a).\nLaw & Analysis\nSection 25D(a)(1) of the Code allows an individual a credit against the tax \nimposed for the taxable year in an amount equal to 30 percent of the qualified solar \nelectric property expenditures made by the taxpayer during such year.  \nSection 25D(d)(2) defines the term \u201cqualified solar electric property expenditure\u201d \nas an expenditure for property which uses solar energy to generate electricity for use in \na dwelling unit located in the United States and used as a residence by the taxpayer.  \nSection 25D(e)(1) allows the expenditures for labor costs properly allocable to \nthe onsite preparation, assembly, or original installation of the qualified solar electric \nproperty and for piping or wiring to interconnect such property to the dwelling unit to be \ntaken into account for purposes of \u00a7 25D.\nUnder \u00a7 25D(e)(8)(A), generally, for purposes of determining the tax year when \nthe credit is allowed, an expenditure with respect to an item shall be treated as made \nwhen the original installation of the item is completed.  Under \u00a7 25D(e)(8)(B), in the \ncase of an expenditure in connection with the construction or reconstruction of a \nstructure, such expenditure shall be treated as made when the original use of the \nconstructed or reconstructed structure by the taxpayer begins.\nSection 61(a) provides, that, except as otherwise provided by law, gross income \nmeans all income from whatever source derived, including gains derived from dealings \nin property (\u00a7 61(a)(3)).  Under \u00a7 61, Congress intends to tax all gains or undeniable \naccessions to wealth, clearly realized, over which taxpayers have complete dominion.  \nCommissioner v. Glenshaw Glass Co., 348 U.S. 426 (1955).\nSection 136 provides an exception to this general rule, stating that gross income \ndoes not include the value of any subsidy provided (directly or indirectly) by a public \nutility to a customer for the purchase or installation of any energy conservation \nmeasure.  Section 136(b) provides, in relevant part, that a taxpayer may not take a tax \ncredit (such as the credit under \u00a7 25D) for an expenditure to the extent of the amount \nexcluded as a subsidy under \u00a7 136(a) with respect to the expenditure.\nIn the current situation, Taxpayer sold all of the environmental attributes \nassociated with the RECs to Public Utility in exchange for a payment.  As such, Public \nUtility\u2019s payment to Taxpayer is neither a rebate nor purchase-price adjustment, since \nPublic Utility has no reasonable nexus to the cost or sale of the subject property from \nthe vendor, X.  Also, the payment is not a \u201csubsidy\u201d intended to facilitate the acquisition \nof property deemed advantageous to the payor, though Public Utility may make such \nPLR-102696-10\n4\npayments in other contexts.  Rather, Taxpayer represents that the transaction between \nthe parties is effectively a sale or exchange of property and property rights.  Public \nUtility will in fact make no payment to Taxpayer absent the transfer of Taxpayer\u2019s \nvaluable property interests (namely, the RECs associated with the Residential Solar \nSystem purchased by Taxpayer from X), and the parties specifically state that the \nsubject payment is to be made in consideration of the transfer of such property \ninterests.  \nBased solely on the information submitted and representations made, we \nconclude that the proceeds from this sales transaction are not within the purview of \n\u00a7 136.  Consequently, Taxpayer must include gain from the sale of the RECs to Public \nUtility in Taxpayer\u2019s gross income under \u00a7 61(a).  Further, Taxpayer is not required \nunder \u00a7 136(b) to reduce the basis in the Residential Solar System.  Taxpayer \nrepresents that the Residential Solar System generates electricity for Taxpayer\u2019s \nresidence located in the United States.  Thus, Taxpayer may take a credit for 30 % of \nthe expenditures for qualified solar electric property, and Taxpayer does not have to \nreduce the expenditure by the amount of the REC Payment.  \nThe rulings contained in this letter are based upon information and \nrepresentations submitted by Taxpayer and accompanied by a penalty of perjury \nstatement executed by Taxpayer.  While this office has not verified any of the material \nsubmitted in support of the request for rulings, it is subject to verification on \nexamination.  Except as specifically set forth above, we express no opinion concerning \nthe federal income tax consequences of the facts or transactions described above \nunder any other provision of the Code.  Specifically, we express no opinion on whether \nthe amounts allocated to the qualified expenditures are correct and thus we express no \nopinion on the accuracy of the tax credit amount.\nThis ruling is directed only to the taxpayer who requested it.  Under \u00a7 6110(k)(3) \nof the Code, a letter ruling may not be used or cited as precedent. \nIn accordance with a power of attorney on file in this office, we are sending a \ncopy of this letter ruling to your authorized representatives.\nSincerely,\nJaime C.

Decedent died on \nDate 1, prior to September 25, 1985.  Decedent was survived by 3 children, Child 1, \nPLR-154099-05 \n \n \n- 3 -\nChild 2, and Child 3, as well as the 4 children of Child 2, Grandchild 1, Grandchild 2, \nGrandchild 3, and Grandchild 4. Subsequently, Child 3 married and had two children, \nGrandchild 5 and Grandchild 6. \n \n \nArticle V of Decedent\u2019s Will provided for the establishment of a residuary trust \n(Trust) for the benefit of his children and their issue.  Article V provides for the payment \nof income as follows:  \n \n \nMy trustees shall pay the net income therefrom in equal shares at \nreasonable intervals to my children, [Child 1, Child 2, and Child 3].  Upon the \ndeath of any of said children, the income to which such child so dying had been \nentitled shall be paid in equal shares to the issue of all of said children living at \nthe time of payment thereof.  Upon the death of any issue, who had been \nreceiving payment of income, leaving issue then surviving, such surviving issue \nshall be entitled to share in income of the trust estate equally with all other issue \nof my said children.  \n \n(emphasis added). Article V authorizes the trustees to distribute principal as \nfollows: \n \n \nMy trustees shall have the power in their uncontrolled discretion to use \nand apply such part of the principal of the trust estate as they may consider \nsuitable or necessary in the event of sickness or accident to any life beneficiary \nor remainderman or in the event any life beneficiary or remainderman requires \nthe use of such principal in order to maintain the standard of living to which such \nperson is accustomed.  In the event that a portion of the principal is so used for \nthe benefit of a remainderman, there shall be deducted upon ultimate distribution \nthe portion of principal so used from the distributive share of such person.     \n \n \nArticle V provides that Trust will terminate on the death of the last survivor among \nChild 1, Child 2, and Child 3.  The remaining assets will be distributed in equal shares to \nthe then surviving issue of Child 1, Child 2, and Child 3, \u201cper capita and not per stirpes;\u201d \nand if none, to Decedent\u2019s then living heirs at law under the State laws of succession.   \nFurther, Article V defines \u201cissue\u201d as follows: \n \n \nThe word, \u201cissue\u201d, when used in the Article shall not include a lineal \ndescendant whose lineal ancestor is living at the time of any payment \nhereinbefore provided to be made and which lineal ancestor is a lineal \ndescendant of mine. \n \n \nArticle V provides that the trustees may carry out its provisions through multiple \ntrusts or through a single trust, \u201cor as they may determine.\u201d   \n \nPLR-154099-05 \n \n \n- 4 -\n \nUnder Article II, Child 1, Child 2, Child 3 and Bank were named, and served, as \ninitial trustees of Trust. \n \n \nOn Date 2, Child 1 died without issue.  Following his death, the trustees initially \ndistributed Child 1\u2019s one-third share of the income of Trust equally between Child 2 and \nChild 3.  However, within two years of Child 1\u2019s death, upon advice from counsel for \nBank, the trustees determined that Child 1\u2019s one-third share of the income should be \ndistributed in equal shares to Decedent\u2019s six then living grandchildren.  The trustees \nadjusted income distributions to effect this change retroactively to the date of Child 1\u2019s \ndeath.   \n \n \nOn Date 3, in response to a petition by the then acting individual trustees, Court \n2 issued an order approving the removal of Bank as trustee and modifying Trust to \npermit each individual trustee to appoint a successor trustee.  The court order further \nmodified Trust to require that, \u201cif practical,\u201d at least one descendant of each child of \nDecedent will be acting as a trustee and that there will always be an uneven number of \nindividual trustees.   \n \n \nOn Date 4, Child 3 died, survived by her spouse and her two children, Grandchild \n5 and Grandchild 6.  After Child 3\u2019s death, the trustees continued distributing one-third \nof the income of Trust to Child 2 and began distributing two-thirds of the income (the \nshares of Child 1 and Child 3) in equal shares to Grandchildren 1-6.   \n \n \nSeveral years after Child 3\u2019s death, in Year 1, Grandchild 5 and Grandchild 6 \ninformed the trustees that they disagreed with the manner in which the trustees had \nbeen distributing income since the death of Child 1.  At that time Child 2, Grandchild 2, \nand Child 3\u2019s surviving spouse, Individual 1, were serving as trustees and these same \nindividuals are currently serving as trustees.  \n \n \nChild 2 and Grandchildren 1, 2, 3, and 4 retained the same counsel. Individual 1 \nobtained separate counsel.  Grandchildren 5 and 6 each obtained separate counsel.        \n \n \nOn Date 5, the trustees filed a petition in Court 1 for an order: (1) construing the \ntrust; (2) passing upon the acts of the trustees; and (3) instructing the trustees.  In the \npetition, the trustees sought court approval of their method of distributing Trust income.   \n \n \nOn Date 6, Grandchildren 5 and 6 filed in Court 2 a petition seeking, inter alia, a \ncourt order removing of the trustees and appointing an independent successor trustee \nand an order compelling the trustees to account, surcharging the trustees, and awarding \ndamages. The petition alleged that the trustees had misinterpreted the income \ndistribution provisions of Trust and had never properly provided appropriate accountings \nto Grandchildren 5 and 6.  On Date 7, the trustees filed accountings for Date 8 through \nDate 9.  On Date 10, Grandchild 6 filed in Court 2 Objections to Account and Petition to \nPLR-154099-05 \n \n \n- 5 -\n(1) Subject the Trust to Probate Court Supervision; (2) Suspend the Powers of the \nTrustees; and (3) Appoint a Temporary Trustee.   \n \n \nOn Date 11, Court 1 resolved a venue dispute among the parties by issuing an \norder to consolidate the proceedings in Court 1.  Thereafter, the parties filed cross-\nmotions for summary judgment and memoranda of points and authority supporting their \ncompeting interpretations of the income distribution provisions of Trust.   \n \n \nGrandchildren 1, 2, 3, and 4 contended that under the express terms of Article V, \non the death of a child of Decedent prior to termination of the Trust, the deceased \nchild\u2019s share of Trust income is to be paid \u201cin equal shares to the issue of all of \n[Decedent\u2019s] children living at the time of payment thereof.\u201d  Accordingly, after the \nrespective deaths of Child 1 and Child 3, the trustee properly paid that deceased child\u2019s \none-third share of Trust income equally to Grandchildren 1-6, the then living issue of \nDecedent\u2019s children.   \n \n \nOn the other hand, Grandchildren 5 and 6 argued that Article V also expressly \nprovides that the term \u201cissue\u201d as used in the Article \u201cshall not include a lineal \ndescendant whose lineal ancestor is living at the time of any payment. . .\u201d (emphasis \nadded.) Since Grandchildren 1-4\u2019s parent, Child 2 is still living, they are not entitled to \nany portion of the income previously paid to Child 1 and Child 3.  Rather, after the death \nof Child 1 followed by the death of Child 3, each deceased child\u2019s one-third share of \nTrust income should have been paid solely to the children of Child 3, Grandchildren 5  \nand 6, the only issue of Decedent\u2019s children whose lineal ancestor (Child 3) was not \nliving at that time.  Grandchild 6 also objected to the trustees\u2019 manner of investing Trust \nassets.   \n  \n \nGrandchildren 1, 2, 3, and 4 maintained that this construction of Article V was \nincorrect.  Further, they maintained that the applicable statute of limitations, among \nother rules, barred any claim that the interpretation of the Will, consistently applied by \nthe trustees for over 10 years, was incorrect. \n \n \nOn Date 12, Court 1 issued an order granting summary judgment in favor of the \nTrustees and Grandchildren 1, 2, 3, and 4 and against Grandchildren 5 and 6.  Court 1 \nentered its judgment on Date 13.  Grandchildren 5 and 6 each filed timely notices of \nappeal from the judgment and related orders.    \n \n \nThe parties participated in court-ordered mediation on Date 14, and, on the same \nday, the following parties executed a Settlement Agreement:  Child 2, individually and \nas trustee; Grandchild 1; Grandchild 2, individually and as trustee;  Grandchild 3; \nGrandchild 4; Grandchild 5; Grandchild 6; Individual 1, individually and as trustee.  The \nspouses, and in one case, the former spouse, of Child 2 and Grandchildren 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, \nand 6 also executed the agreement.    \nPLR-154099-05 \n \n \n- 6 -\n \n \nThe Settlement Agreement is conditioned upon issuance by the Internal Revenue \nService of a favorable ruling regarding the GST tax consequences of the Settlement \nAgreement.  The Settlement Agreement provides that the claims raised in the litigation \n(the Pending Claims) will be stayed until the Action Date (the date the Internal Revenue \nService issues a favorable ruling regarding the GST tax consequences) or the \nCancellation Date (the date the Internal Revenue Service issues an adverse ruling), \nwhen the stay will be dissolved.  The Pending Claims will be dismissed with prejudice \nupon the earlier of the death of Child 2 or the Action Date.  Under the terms of the \nSettlement Agreement, if Child 2 dies before the Internal Revenue Service issues a \nruling, the Trustees will distribute the remaining balance of Trust under the terms of \nTrust immediately before the date the Settlement Agreement was executed; and the \nPending Claims will be dismissed with prejudice.         \n \n \nOn Date 15, the Guardian Ad Litem, who represents the minor and unborn \ncontingent remainder beneficiaries of Trust, issued a report to Court 1, supporting the \nSettlement Agreement and approving the petition for an order approving the Settlement \nAgreement.  On Date 16, Court 1 approved the Settlement Agreement and authorized \nand directed the trustees to modify, reform, and divide Trust under the terms, and \nsubject to the conditions, provided in the agreement.   \n \n \nUnder the Settlement Agreement, Trust will be modified as follows.  On the \nAction Date, the trustees will divide Trust into seven shares, one share for each among \nChild 2 and Grandchildren 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.  The assets of Trust will be allocated to \nthese shares as follows:  one-third of every asset to Child 2\u2019s share; one-sixth of every \nasset to the share for each of Grandchild 5 and Grandchild 6; one-twelfth of every asset \nto the share for each of Grandchildren 1, 2, 3, and 4.  Each share will be held as a \nSeparate Trust by the trustee named for that trust.  The trustees will be as follows:  for \nChild 2\u2019s Separate Trust, Child 2 and Grandchild 2; for Grandchild 1\u2019s Separate Trust, \nGrandchild 1 or Grandchild 2; for Grandchild 2\u2019s Separate Trust, Grandchild 2 or \nIndividual 2; for Grandchild 3\u2019s Separate Trust, Grandchild 3 or Grandchild 2; for \nGrandchild 4\u2019s Separate Trust, Grandchild 4 or Grandchild 2.  Grandchild 5 and \nGrandchild 6 will each serve as sole trustee of the respective Separate Trust held for \nthat Grandchild.  Each Grandchild will serve as the sole trustee of the Separate Trust \nheld for that Grandchild, unless the Internal Revenue Service denies the ruling \nrequested under \u00a7 2041; in that case, the other trustee named will serve.     \n \n \nThe terms of Trust will be modified to provide for Child 2\u2019s Separate Trust to be \nadministered as follows.  The net income of the Separate Trust for Child 2 will be paid at \nreasonable intervals to Child 2.  During Child 2\u2019s life, principal may be distributed as \nfollows: \n \nPLR-154099-05 \n \n \n- 7 -\nThe trustee of [Child 2\u2019s] trust shall have the power in the trustee\u2019s uncontrolled \ndiscretion to use and apply such part of the principal of this trust estate as the \ntrustee may consider suitable or necessary in the event of sickness or accident to \n[Child 2] or in the event [Child 2] requires the use of such principal in order to \nmaintain the standard of living to which [Child 2] is accustomed.   \n \n \nChild 2\u2019s Separate Trust will terminate at Child 2\u2019s death.  Upon termination, the \nremaining balance of the Separate Trust will be distributed in equal shares among Child \n2\u2019s children.  The share of a child who predeceases Child 2, but who has then living \nissue, will be distributed by right of representation to such then living issue.   The share \nof a child who predeceases Child 2, but who has no then living issue, will be distributed \nto that predeceased child\u2019s estate.   \n \n \nThe terms of Trust will be modified to provide for each Grandchild\u2019s Separate \nTrust to be administered as follows.  The net income of the Grandchild\u2019s Separate Trust \nwill be paid at regular intervals to the Grandchild, and at the Grandchild\u2019s death, to the \nGrandchild\u2019s then living issue by right of representation, and if none, to the Grandchild\u2019s \nestate.  Principal may be distributed during the term of the Separate Trust as follows: \n \nThe trustee of this trust shall have the power in the trustee\u2019s uncontrolled \ndiscretion to use and apply such part of the principal of this trust estate as the \ntrustee may consider suitable or necessary in the event of sickness or accident to \n[Child 2], or to any income beneficiary or remainderman of this trust or in the \nevent [Child 2] or any income beneficiary or remainderman of this trust requires \nthe use of such principal in order to maintain the standard of living to which such \nperson is accustomed.  In the event that a portion of the principal is so used for \nthe benefit of a remainderman, there shall be deducted upon ultimate distribution \nthe portion of principal so used from the distributive share of such person. \n \nThe Separate Trust held for a Grandchild will terminate at Child 2\u2019s death and will be \ndistributed to the Grandchild, if then living, but if not, to the Grandchild\u2019s then living \nissue, by right of representation; and if none, to the Grandchild\u2019s estate.   \n \n \nThe Settlement Agreement further provides that the provisions of the Date 3 \nOrder Removing Trustee and Modifying Trust to Allow Appointment of Successor \nTrustees in Court 2 will apply to the appointment of successor trustees for each of the \nSeparate Trusts except that successor trustees need not be descendants of Decedent \nand there need not be an uneven number of individual trustees.   \n \n \nExcept as modified by the Settlement Agreement, all of the original provisions of \nTrust will apply to each Separate Trust.   \n \nPLR-154099-05 \n \n \n- 8 -\n \nUntil the earlier of the division of Trust on the Action Date or the distribution of \nTrust at the death of Child 2, all current Trust distributions to income beneficiaries, \nwhich the trustees have been making on a monthly basis, will continue to be made one-\nthird to Child 2 and one-ninth to each of Grandchildren 1-6.  Upon the earlier of the \ndivision of Trust on the Action Date or the distribution of Trust at the death of Child 2, \nGrandchildren 1, 2, 3, and 4 will each pay to Grandchild 5 one-seventy-second of the \ntotal amount paid to income beneficiaries from Date 17 through the Action Date plus \n$75,000; and Grandchildren 1, 2, 3, and 4 will each pay to Grandchild 6 one-seventy-\nsecond of the total amount paid to income beneficiaries from Date 17 through the Action \nDate plus $75,000.  These payments are intended to compensate Grandchild 5 and \nGrandchild 6 for the additional income (in addition to the one-ninth share) they are \nentitled to receive under the terms of the Settlement Agreement that will not be paid to \nthem prior to the Action Date.  \n \n \nUnder subsection 7(h) of the Settlement Agreement, the term \u201cremainderman\u201d as \nused to apply to the Separate Trust for Grandchild 6 refers to Grandchild 6 and to the \nissue and estate of Grandchild 6.  The term \u201cremainderman\u201d as used to apply to the \nSeparate Trust for each other Grandchild refers only to the Grandchild for whom the \ntrust is held and to that Grandchild\u2019s issue.  On Date 18, the trustees petitioned Court 1 \nto request approval of an amendment to the Settlement Agreement signed by the \nparties to the agreement adding a new subsection 7(l) that provides as follows: \n \n[N]otwithstanding subsection 7(h) above or any other provision [of the \nagreement], during the lifetime of [Child 2] no distribution of principal from any \nseparate trust may be made to a great-grandchild (or remote issue) of [Decedent] \nduring any time that the great-grandchild\u2019s (or more remote issue\u2019s) ancestor \nwho is a descendant of a child of [Decedent] is living.     \n \n \nOn Date 19, Court 1 approved the amendment and authorized and directed the \ntrustees to modify, reform, and divide Trust under the terms and conditions of the \nSettlement Agreement as amended on that date.   \n \n \n \nIt is represented that no additions, actual or constructive, have been made to \nTrust since its creation.   \n \n \nThe taxpayers have requested the following rulings:   \n \n \n1.  Implementation of the provisions of the Settlement Agreement pursuant to \nwhich Child 2 serves as co-trustee, and could serve as sole trustee, and pursuant to \nwhich each of the six Grandchildren of Decedent serve as sole trustees of their \nrespective separate trusts will not cause Child 2 or any of the six Grandchildren to be \ndeemed to have a general power of appointment over his or her separate trust under \u00a7 \n2041.   \nPLR-154099-05 \n \n \n- 9 -\n \n \n2.  Implementation of the Settlement Agreement will not cause Trust, or the \nseven separate trusts into which Trust will be divided, to lose their status as trusts that \nare exempt from the generation-skipping transfer (GST) tax by reason of \n\u00a7 1433(b)(2)(A) of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 and \u00a7 26.2601-1(b)(1)(i) of the \nGeneration-Skipping Transfer Tax Regulations. \n \nRuling Request # 1: \n \nSection 2041(a)(2) provides that the value of the gross estate shall include the \nvalue of all property to the extent of any property with respect to which the decedent has \nat the time of death a general power of appointment created after October 21, 1942, or \nwith respect to which the decedent has at any time exercised or released such a power \nof appointment by a disposition which is of such nature that if it were a transfer of \nproperty owned by the decedent, such property would be includible in the decedent's \ngross estate under \u00a7\u00a7 2035 to 2038, inclusive. \n \nSection 2041(b)(1) provides that the term \"general power of appointment\" means \na power which is exercisable in favor of the individual possessing the power, his estate, \nhis creditors, or the creditors of his estate.  Section 2041(b)(1)(A) provides that a power \nto consume, invade or appropriate property for the benefit of the possessor that is \nlimited by an ascertainable standard relating to the health, education, support or \nmaintenance of the possessor is not a general power of appointment.   \n \nUnder \u00a7 20.2041-1(c)(2) of the Estate Tax Regulations, a power to consume, \ninvade, or appropriate income or corpus, or both, for the benefit of the decedent which \nis limited by an ascertainable standard relating to the health, education, support or \nmaintenance of the decedent is, by reason of \u00a7 2041(b)(1)(A), not a general power of \nappointment.  A power is limited by such a standard if the extent of the holder's duty to \nexercise and not to exercise the power is reasonably measurable in terms of his needs \nfor health, education, or support (or any combination of them).  As used in this \nsubparagraph, the words \u201csupport\u201d and \u201cmaintenance\u201d are synonymous and their \nmeaning is not limited to the bare necessities of life.  A power to use property for the \ncomfort, welfare or happiness of the holder of the power is not limited by the requisite \nstandard.  Examples of powers which are limited by the requisite standard are powers \nexercisable for the holder's \u201csupport,\u201d \u201csupport in reasonable comfort,\u201d \u201cmaintenance in \nhealth and reasonable comfort,\u201d \u201csupport in his accustomed manner of living,\u201d \n\u201ceducation, including college and professional education,\u201d \u201chealth,\u201d and \u201cmedical, dental, \nhospital and nursing expenses and expenses of invalidism.\u201d \n \n \nUnder the Settlement Agreement, Grandchildren 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 will each be \nthe sole trustee and the income beneficiary of a separate trust for his or her own benefit.  \nPLR-154099-05 \n \n \n- 10 -\nChild 2 and Grandchild 2 will be trustees of a separate trust of which Child 2 is the \nincome beneficiary.   \n \n \nUnder the terms of each separate trust, the trustee has discretion to use or apply \nany amount of principal the trustee considers suitable or necessary in the event of \nsickness or accident to an income beneficiary or in the event an income beneficiary of \nthe trust requires the use of such principal to maintain the standard of living to which the \nincome beneficiary is accustomed.  Under Rev. Rul. 77-60, 1977-1 C.B. 282, a power to \nuse property to enable the donee of the power to continue an accustomed mode of \nliving, without further limitation, is not an ascertainable standard under \u00a7 2041(b)(1)(A).  \nHowever, under State Statute, a person who is a beneficiary of a trust that permits the \nperson as trustee, or cotrustee, to make discretionary distributions of income or \nprincipal to or for that person\u2019s own benefit may exercise that power only for that \nperson\u2019s health, education, support, or maintenance within the meaning of \u00a7 2041 of the \nInternal Revenue Code.  If a power to make discretionary distributions of income or \nprincipal is conferred upon two or more trustees, the power may be exercised by any \ntrustee who is not a current permissible beneficiary of that power.  If there is no trustee \nwho is not a current permissible beneficiary of that power, any party in interest may \napply to a court of competent jurisdiction to appoint a trustee who is not a current \npermissible beneficiary of that power, and the power may be exercised  by the trustee \nappointed by the court.  Thus, under State Statute, Child 2 and Grandchildren 1, 2, 3, 4, \n5, and 6, acting as trustee of his or her respective separate trust, may each make \ndiscretionary distributions of principal from that separate trust only for his or her own \nhealth, education, support, or maintenance.  Cf., Rev. Rul. 54-153, 1954-1 C.B. 185.  \nSee also, Rev. Proc. 94-44, 1994-2 C.B. 683.   \n \n \nAccordingly, based on the facts submitted and the representations made, we \nconclude that implementation of the portion of the Settlement Agreement pursuant to \nwhich Child 2 serves as co-trustee, and could serve as sole trustee, and pursuant to \nwhich each of the six Grandchildren of Decedent serve as sole trustees of their \nrespective separate trusts will not cause Child 2 or any of the six Grandchildren to be \ndeemed to have a general power of appointment over his or her separate trust under \u00a7 \n2041.   \n \nRuling Request # 1: \n \nSection 2601 imposes a tax on each generation-skipping transfer made by a \ntransferor to a skip person. \n \nUnder \u00a7 1433(a) of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, the generation-skipping transfer \ntax is generally applicable to generation-skipping transfers made after October 22, \n1986.  However, under \u00a7 1433(b)(2)(A) of the Tax Reform Act and \u00a7 26.2601-1(b)(1)(i), \nthe tax does not apply to a transfer from a trust,  if the trust was irrevocable on \nPLR-154099-05 \n \n \n- 11 -\nSeptember 25, 1985, and no addition (actual or constructive) was made to the trust after \nthat date.  Under \u00a7 26.2601-1(b)(1)(ii), any trust in existence on September 25, 1985, \nwill be considered irrevocable unless the settlor had a power that would have caused \ninclusion of the trust in his or her gross estate under \u00a7\u00a7 2038 or 2042, if the settlor had \ndied on September 25, 1985. \n \nSection 26.2601-1(b)(4)(i) provides rules for determining when a modification, \njudicial construction, settlement agreement, or trustee action with respect to a trust that \nis exempt from the generation-skipping transfer tax will not cause the trust to lose its \nexempt status.  The regulation provides that the rules contained in the paragraph are \ngenerally applicable only for purposes of determining whether an exempt trust retains its \nexempt status for generation-skipping transfer tax purposes.  Unless noted otherwise, \nthe rules do not apply in determining, for example, whether the transaction results in a \ngift subject to gift tax, or may cause the trust to be included in the gross estate of a \nbeneficiary, or may result in the realization of capital gain for purposes of \u00a7 1001.  \n \n \nSection 26.2601-1(b)(4)(i)(B) provides that a court-approved settlement of a bona \nfide issue regarding the administration of a trust or the construction of the terms of the \ngoverning instrument will not cause an exempt trust to be subject to the provisions of \nchapter 13, if - (1) The settlement is the product of arm's length negotiations; and (2) \nThe settlement is within the range of reasonable outcomes under the governing \ninstrument and applicable state law addressing the issues resolved by the settlement.  \nA settlement that results in a compromise between the positions of the litigating parties \nand reflects the parties' assessments of the relative strengths of their positions is a \nsettlement that is within the range of reasonable outcomes. \n \n \nSection 26.2601-1(b)(4)(i)(D) provides that a modification will not cause an \nexempt trust to be subject to the provisions of chapter 13, if the modification does not \nshift a beneficial interest in the trust to any beneficiary who occupies a lower generation \n(as defined in \u00a7 2651) than the person or persons who held the beneficial interest prior \nto the modification, and the modification does not extend the time for vesting of any \nbeneficial interest in the trust beyond the period provided for in the original trust.  A \nmodification of an exempt trust will result in a shift in beneficial interest to a lower \ngeneration beneficiary if the modification can result in either an increase in the amount \nof a GST transfer or the creation of a new GST transfer. \n \n \nIn this case, Trust was created and irrevocable before September 25, 1985.  It is \nrepresented that no additions, actual or constructive, have been made to Trust since it \nwas created.  Consequently, based on these representations, Trust is currently exempt \nfrom GST tax.     \n \n \nA bona fide issue has been presented regarding the proper construction of Article \nV as it pertains to the distribution of Trust income since the death of Child 1, and the \nPLR-154099-05 \n \n \n12 \nsubsequent death of Child 3.  The issue has been the subject of protracted litigation. \nThe Settlement Agreement is the product of arm's length negotiation between the \nparties to the agreement.  The Settlement Agreement represents a compromise \nbetween the positions of the parties and reflects the parties' assessments of the relative \nstrengths of their position.  The Settlement Agreement has been approved by the \nguardian ad litem appointed for the minor, unborn, and unascertained contingent \nbeneficiaries of Trust.  Finally, the Settlement Agreement has been approved by the \nappropriate local court.   \n \n \nFurther, to the extent the Settlement Agreement modifies the distribution of the \nTrust remainder interest on the termination of the trust on Child 2\u2019s death, the \nmodification does not shift a beneficial interest in the trust to any beneficiary who \noccupies a lower generation than the person or persons who held the beneficial interest \nprior to the modification, and the modification does not extend the time for vesting of \nany beneficial interest in the trust beyond the period provided for in the original trust.   \n \n \nAccordingly, based on the facts submitted and the representations made, we \nconclude that implementation of the Settlement Agreement will not cause Trust, or the \nseven separate trusts into which Trust will be divided, to lose their status as trusts that \nare exempt from the generation-skipping transfer (GST) tax by reason of \n\u00a7 1433(b)(2)(A) of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 and \u00a7 26.2601-1(b)(1)(i). \n \n \nExcept as specifically ruled herein, we express no opinion on the federal tax \nconsequences of the proposed modifications of Trust pursuant to the Settlement \nAgreement under the cited provisions or under any other provisions of the Code.   \n \n \nThis ruling is directed only to the taxpayer who requested it.  Section 6110(k)(3) \nprovides that it may not be used or cited as precedent.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSincerely yours, \n \n    \n                                               \n \n          _________________________ \n                                   \n                                George Masnik, Chief \n                                                                           Branch 4 \n                                                                           Office of Associate Chief Counsel \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(Passthroughs and Special \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Industries) \n \n \nEnclosure \n     Copy for section 6110 purposes \n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Non-Adverse"}]}

Specifically, you requested a ruling that compensation paid under the Plan \n(defined below) upon attainment of a performance goal will be considered performance-\nbased compensation under section 162(m)(4)(C), provided it meets all of the \nrequirements of that section, even though the compensation could have been paid upon \nExecutive\u2019s termination without \u201ccause\u201d or for \u201cgood reason,\u201d without attaining the \nperformance goal. \n \n \nCompany, a publicly-held corporation under section 162(m)(2) of the Code, has \nadopted an incentive plan (Plan) that provides a variety of incentive awards, including \nperformance share and performance unit awards.  These incentive awards are intended \nto be qualified performance-based compensation under section 162(m)(4)(C).   \n \n \nCompany has entered into an Employment Agreement (Agreement) with \nExecutive.  The Agreement provides that if Executive\u2019s employment is terminated by \nCompany other than for \u201ccause\u201d or by Executive for \u201cgood reason,\u201d any performance \ngoal under any outstanding performance share or performance unit awards shall be \n2 \nPLR-112625-07 \n \n \ndeemed to be achieved at target and the awards shall vest at termination to the extent \nsuch awards would have become vested in accordance with the regular vesting \nschedule had Executive\u2019s employment continued for a period of two years following \nExecutive\u2019s termination date.  The terms \u201ccause\u201d and \u201cgood reason\u201d are defined in the \nAgreement.  \n \nSection 162(a)(1) of the Code allows as a deduction all the ordinary and \nnecessary expenses paid or incurred during the taxable year in carrying on any trade or \nbusiness, including a reasonable allowance for salaries or other compensation for \npersonal services actually rendered. \n \n \nSection 162(m)(1) of the Code provides that in the case of any publicly held \ncorporation, no deduction is allowed for applicable employee remuneration with respect \nto any covered employee to the extent that the amount of the remuneration for the \ntaxable year exceeds $1,000,000. \n \n \nSection 162(m)(4)(A) of the Code defines \u201capplicable employee remuneration,\u201d \nwith respect to any covered employee for any taxable year, generally as the aggregate \namount allowable as a deduction for the taxable year (determined without regard to \nsection 162(m)) for remuneration for services performed by the employee (whether or \nnot during the taxable year).   \n \nSection 162(m)(4)(C) of the Code provides that applicable employee \nremuneration does not include any remuneration payable solely on account of the \nattainment of one or more performance goals, but only if (i) the performance goals are \ndetermined by a compensation committee of the board of directors of the taxpayer \nwhich is comprised solely of 2 or more outside directors, (ii) the material terms under \nwhich the remuneration is to be paid, including the performance goals, are disclosed to \nshareholders and approved by a majority of the vote in a separate shareholder vote \nbefore payment of such remuneration, and (iii) before any payment of such \nremuneration, the compensation committee referred to in clause (i) certifies that the \nperformance goals and other material terms were in fact satisfied. \n \n \nSection 1.162-27(e)(2)(i) of the Income Tax Regulations (regulations) provides, in \npart, that qualified performance-based compensation must be paid solely on account of \nthe attainment of one or more preestablished, objective performance goals. \n \n \n \nSection 1.162-27(e)(2)(v) of the regulations provides that the compensation does \nnot satisfy the performance goal requirement if the facts and circumstances indicate that \nthe employee would receive all or part of the compensation regardless of whether the \nperformance goal is attained.  Thus, if the payment of compensation under a grant or \naward is only nominally or partially contingent on attaining a performance goal, none of \n3 \nPLR-112625-07 \n \n \nthe compensation payable under the grant of award will be considered performance-\nbased.  This section also provides that compensation does not fail to be qualified \nperformance-based compensation merely because the plan allows the compensation to \nbe payable upon death, disability, or change of ownership or control, although \ncompensation actually paid on account of those events prior to the attainment of the \nperformance goal would not satisfy the performance goal requirement. \n \n \nThe provision in the Agreement allowing for payment of performance share or \nperformance unit awards under the Plan upon Executive\u2019s termination by Company \nwithout cause or by Executive with good reason does not meet the exception in section \n1.162-27(e)(2)(v) of the regulations that allows compensation to be payable upon death, \ndisability or change of ownership or control.  Thus, compensation paid to Executive with \nrespect to performance share or performance unit awards is not payable solely upon \nattainment of a performance goal, for purposes of section 162(m)(4)(C) of the Code.  \nAccordingly, we rule as follows: \n \n \nCompensation paid to Executive upon attainment of a performance goal under \nany performance share or performance unit awards will not be considered performance-\nbased compensation under section 162(m)(4)(C) of the Code.   \n \n \nExcept as specifically ruled above, no opinion is expressed as to the federal tax \nconsequences of the transaction described above under any other provision of the \nCode.  No opinion was requested and none is expressed regarding any aspect of \nawards granted or compensation paid under the Plan other than as described above.  \nThe ruling is directed only to the taxpayer requesting it.  Section 6110(k)(3) of the Code \nprovides that it may not be used or cited as precedent.   \n \nIn accordance with the Power of Attorney on file with this office, a copy of this \nletter is being sent to your authorized representatives. \n \n \nSincerely yours, \n \n \n                                               \n \nKENNETH M.

After the merger, the Company 1 \nconsolidated group continued with Parent as the common parent.  \nSpecifically, effective on Date 5, the following steps were undertaken to effectuate the \nmerger transaction (the \u201cTransaction\u201d):  \nStep 1:  Company 1 formed Parent and Parent formed two wholly owned \nsubsidiaries, Sub 1 and Sub 2.\nStep 2:  Sub 1 merged with and into Company 1 with Company 1 surviving.  \nPursuant to the merger, each share of common stock of Company 1 was \nconverted into the right to receive a share of Parent stock.  The Company 1 \nstockholders received Parent shares in a one-for-one exchange for their former \nshares of common stock of Company 1 (the \u201cCompany 1 Acquisition\u201d).\nStep 3:  Sub 2 merged with and into Company 2 with Company 2 surviving.  \nPursuant to the merger, each share of common stock of Company 2 (other than \nshares held by Company 2 as treasury stock or that were owned by Company 2, \nSub 2 or any wholly owned subsidiary of Company 2, and shares with respect to \nwhich appraisal rights under State A law were properly exercised and not \nwithdrawn) was converted into (i) the right to receive $a in cash, without interest, \nand (ii) x shares of validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable common stock \nof Parent  (the \u201cCompany 2 Acquisition\u201d).\nPLR-139485-12\n3\nThe Company 1 Acquisition qualified for tax-free treatment as an exchange under \u00a7 351 \nof the Internal Revenue Code, a \u00a7 368(a)(1)(B) reorganization or a \u00a7 368(a)(2)(E) \nreorganization.  The shareholders of Company 1 recognized no gain or loss on the \nexchange of their shares for Parent shares, Parent recognized no gain or loss on the \nreceipt of the Company 1 shares in exchange for its stock, and there was carryover \nbasis and holding periods with respect both to Parent\u2019s Company 1 stock, and the \nCompany 1 shareholders\u2019 Parent stock.\nThe Company 2 Acquisition was both a taxable acquisition and qualified as an \nexchange to which \u00a7 351 applies.  The Company 2 shareholders recognized gain but \nnot loss on cash received in exchange for their Company 2 stock pursuant to \u00a7 351(b).  \nParent recognized no gain or loss on the acquisition of the Company 2 stock, and will \ngenerally take carryover basis and holding period.  However, Company 2 shareholders \nbasis in their new Parent stock is reduced by the amount of cash received, and \nincreased by the amount of gain recognized. \nREPRESENTATIONS\nParent makes the following representations:\n1. Prior to the Transaction, Company 1 and Company 2 were not related within the \nmeaning of \u00a7 267(b). \n2. Immediately after the Transaction was consummated, Parent, Company 1 and \nCompany 2 were related within the meaning of \u00a7 267(b).\n3. The Company 2 Acquisition was a taxable acquisition, which qualified as an \nexchange to which \u00a7 351 applies.  Pursuant to \u00a7 351(b), the Company 2 \nshareholders recognized gain (if any) but not loss to the extent cash was \nreceived in exchange for their Company 2 stock.\n4. The Transaction was undertaken to facilitate the combination of the businesses \nof Company 1 and Company 2.\nRULING REQUESTED\nThe Company 2 Acquisition is a \u201ccovered transaction\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 1.263(a)-\n5(e)(3) of the regulations.\nLAW AND ANALYSIS\nPLR-139485-12\n4\nSection 162(a) of the Code provides that there shall be allowed as a deduction all the \nordinary and necessary expenses paid or incurred during the taxable year in carrying on \nany trade or business.   \nSection 263(a)(1) of the Code provides that no deduction shall be allowed for any \namount paid out for new buildings or for permanent improvements or betterments made \nto increase the value of any property or estate.\nSection 1.263(a)-5(a) of the regulations provides, in part, that a taxpayer must capitalize \nan amount paid to facilitate the following transactions:   \n1.\nAn acquisition of assets that constitute a trade or business (whether \nthe taxpayer is the acquirer or the target in the acquisition);\n2.\nAn acquisition by the taxpayer of an ownership interest in a \nbusiness entity if, immediately after the acquisition, the taxpayer and the \nbusiness entity are related within the meaning of \u00a7 267(b) or \u00a7 707(b);\n3.\nAn acquisition of an ownership interest in the taxpayer (other than \nan acquisition by the taxpayer of an ownership interest in the taxpayer, \nwhether by redemption or otherwise);\n4.\nA restructuring, recapitalization, or reorganization of the capital \nstructure of a business entity (including reorganizations described in \u00a7 368 \nand the distribution of stock by the taxpayer as described in \u00a7 355);\n5.\nA transfer described in \u00a7 351 or \u00a7 721 (whether the taxpayer is the \ntransferor or transferee);\n6.\nA formation or organization of a disregarded entity;\n7.\nAn acquisition of capital;\n8.\nA stock issuance;\n9.\nA borrowing; and\n10.\nWriting an option.\nSection 1.263(a)-5(b) of the regulations provides, in part, that an amount is paid to \nfacilitate a transaction if the amount is paid in the process of investigating or otherwise \npursuing the transaction.   Section 1.263(a)-5(e) provides a bright-line rule to determine \nwhether amounts paid in certain covered transactions are facilitative.  Section 1.263(a)-\n5(e)(1) provides that an amount, which is not inherently facilitative (as defined in \nPLR-139485-12\n5\n\u00a7 1.263(a)-5(e)(2)), facilitates a transaction only if the amount relates to activities \nperformed on or after the earlier of (i) the date on which a letter of intent, exclusivity \nagreement, or similar written communication (other than a confidentiality agreement) is \nexecuted by representatives of the acquirer and the target; or (ii) the date on which the \nmaterial terms of the transaction (as tentatively agreed to by the representatives of the \nacquirer and the target) are authorized or approved by the taxpayer's board of directors \n(or committee of the board of directors).  In the case of a transaction that does not \nrequire authorization or approval by the taxpayer\u2019s board of directors, the date \ndetermined under this paragraph is the date on which the acquirer and the target \nexecute a binding written contract reflecting the terms of the transaction.  \nThe bright line rule applies only with respect to \u201ccovered transactions,\u201d which is defined \nin \u00a7 1.263(a)-5(e)(3) of the regulations as: \n(i) a taxable acquisition by the taxpayer of assets that constitute a trade or \nbusiness, \n(ii) a taxable acquisition of an ownership interest in a business entity (whether the \ntaxpayer is the acquirer in the acquisition or the target of the acquisition) if, \nimmediately after the acquisition, the acquirer and the target are related within \nthe meaning of \u00a7 267(b) or \u00a7 707(b), and \n(iii) a reorganization described in \u00a7 368(a)(1)(A), (B), or (C) or a reorganization \ndescribed in \u00a7 368(a)(1)(D) in which stock or securities of the corporation to \nwhich the assets are transferred are distributed in a transaction which qualifies \nunder \u00a7 354 or \u00a7 356.\nParent argues that the Company 2 Acquisition satisfies the requirements for the second \ncategory of covered transactions under \u00a7 1.263(a)-5(e)(3)(ii) because it is a taxable \nacquisition that results in Company 2 being a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent.  \nCompany 2 and Parent are thus related under \u00a7 267(b).\nSection 3.01 of Rev. Proc. 2013-3, 2013-1 I.R.B. 113 (Jan. 2, 2013), provides that the \nService will not issue a ruling concerning most corporate reorganizations.\nRULING\nBased solely on the information submitted and the representations set forth above, we \nrule that the Company 2 Acquisition is a \u201ccovered transaction\u201d within the meaning of      \n\u00a7 1.263(a)-5(e)(3) of the regulations.\nPLR-139485-12\n6\nExcept as expressly provided herein, no opinion is expressed or implied concerning the \ntax consequences of any aspect of any transaction or item discussed or referenced in \nthis letter.  \nThe rulings contained in this letter are based upon information and representations \nsubmitted by the taxpayer and accompanied by a penalty of perjury statement executed \nby an appropriate party.

If said\nmember was separated from service after filing of the written application,\nand had attained twenty-five (25) years or more of service prior to the date\nof separation, the Board of Trustees shall retire said member, under this\nsection and under Sections 54-2-12 and 54-2-13 of this Code.\nSections 54-2-12(a)(1) and 54-2-13(a)(1) of the Statute provides:\nEach such member shall receive a disability pension of fifty percent\n(50%), or such other higher percentage that is in effect and applies to\nsuch member [the percentage payable upon age and years of service\nretirement at the earlier of age 60 or 25 years of service], of the member's\n2\nPLR-120050-00\naverage final compensation at the time of disability retirement.  On the\ndate that a member who retired under Section 54-2-11 of this Code would\nhave accrued twenty-five (25) years of creditable service had the member\ncontinued in active service, or on the date that the member reaches age\nsixty (60), whichever comes first, the member shall be eligible for optional\nbenefits as provided in [City Charter], as amended.\n.\nSections 54-2-12(a)(2) and 54-2-13(a)(2) of the Statute provides:\nIn addition to the disability pension provided for in Section [54-2-12(a)(1)\nor13(a)(1)] of this Code, any member who receives a disability pension\npursuant to Section[s] [54-2-12(a)(1) or 13(a)(1)] of this Code and has not\naccrued a total of twenty-five (25) years of creditable service, as of the\ndate of the member\u2019s disability retirement shall receive a supplemental\ndisability payment in the amount of sixteen and two-thirds percent (16\n\u0001%) of the member\u2019s average final compensation at the time of disability\nretirement.   This supplemental payment shall terminate upon the\nexpiration of the period when a member who retired under Section 54-2-\n11 of this Code and who receives benefits under Section[s] [54-2-12(a)(1)\nor 13(a)(1) of this Code would have accrued twenty-five (25) years of\ncreditable service had the member continued in active service, or on the\ndate that the member reaches age sixty (60), whichever comes first.\nSection 61(a) of the Internal Revenue Code provides that, except as otherwise provided\nby law, gross income means all income from whatever source derived, including\ncompensation for services.\nSection 104(a)(1) of the Code provides that gross income does not include amounts\nreceived under workmen\u2019s compensation acts as compensation for personal injuries or\nsickness.\nSection 1.104-1(b) of the Income Tax Regulations states that section 104(a)(1) of the\nCode excludes from gross income amounts received by an employee under a\nworkmen\u2019s compensation act or under a statute in the nature of a workmen\u2019s\ncompensation act that provides compensation to the employee for personal injury or\nsickness incurred in the course of employment.  Section 104(a)(1) also applies to\ncompensation which is paid under a workmen\u2019s compensation act to the survivor or\nsurvivors of a deceased employee.  Section 104(a)(1) does not apply to a retirement\npension or annuity to the extent it is determined by reference to the employee's age or\nlength of service, or the employee's prior contributions, even though the employee's\nretirement is occasioned by an occupational injury or sickness.  Section 104(a)(1) also\ndoes not apply to amounts which are received as compensation for a non-occupational\ninjury or sickness nor to amounts received as compensation for an occupational injury\n3\nPLR-120050-00\nor sickness to the extent that they are in excess of the amount provided in the\napplicable workmen\u2019s compensation act or acts.\nIf benefits are computed by a formula that does not refer to the employee\u2019s age, length\nof service or prior contributions and are provided to a class that is restricted to\nemployees with service-incurred injuries, sickness or death, then the statute under\nwhich the benefits are paid qualifies as a statute in the nature of a workmen\u2019s\ncompensation act. See, Rev. Rul. 80-84, 1980-1 C.B. 35; Rev. Rul. 83-77, 1983-1 C.B.\n37; Rev. Rul.  80-44, 1980-1 C.B. 34.  The fact that the amount received is based on a\npercentage of the employee\u2019s salary on the date of the disability does not disqualify the\npayment from qualifying as one in the nature of workmen\u2019s compensation.  See, Rev. \nRul.  68-10, 1968-1 C.B. 50.\nHowever, where, under an employer\u2019s retirement rules, an employee\u2019s disability\nretirement pension is converted when he reaches a certain age to a regular service\nretirement pension, the section 104(a)(1) exclusion ceases to apply at the time of the\nconversion.  See, Rev. Rul. 80-14, 1980-1 C.B. 33.\nBased on the information submitted, representations made, and authorities cited above,\nwe conclude as follows:\nSections 54-2-11,12 and 13 of the Statute restrict benefits to a class of employees with\nservice-incurred injuries or diseases resulting in disabilities and constitute statutes in\nthe nature of workmen\u2019s compensation acts.   Sections 54-2-12 and 13 provide for\npayment of a percentage of the injured employee\u2019s final compensation at the time of the\noccurrence of the disability based upon the retirement benefit payable upon the earlier\nof age 60 or 25 years of service, plus an additional 16\u0001% payable until the earlier of\nage 60 or when the employee would have had 25 years of service without regard to the\nemployee\u2019s actual age, length of service or prior contributions.\nThus, disability benefits paid under Sections 54-2-11,12 and 13 of the Statute to a\ndisabled member prior to the time of conversion from duty disability retirement to\nregular service retirement (the earlier of when the member would have accrued twenty-\nfive (25) years of creditable service had the member continued in active service or on\nthe date that the member reaches age sixty) are excludable from gross income under\nsection 104(a)(1) of the Code. \nExcept as specifically ruled upon above, no opinion is expressed or implied with respect\nto the application of any other provisions of the Code or the regulations to the benefits\ndescribed.\n4\nPLR-120050-00\nThis ruling is directed only to the taxpayer requesting it.

Settlement payments from the Fund to mutual fund investors are not subject \nto information reporting under section 6041 of the Internal Revenue Code, except in the \ncase of payments made directly to participants in tax-qualified retirement plans. \n \n           2.  Settlement payments from the Fund to mutual fund investors are not subject \nto information reporting under section 6045.    \n \n           3.  Settlement payments from the Fund to mutual fund investors are not subject \nto information reporting under section 6049. \n  \n           4.  For purposes of meeting any obligations it may have under section 3406 as a \npayor of \u201creportable payments,\u201d the Fund need not solicit taxpayer identification \nnumbers (TINs) from the individuals to whom it will make distributions.  The Fund may \nobtain the TINs from the mutual funds or tax-qualified plans in which such individuals \nheld accounts, or from transfer agents performing services for the funds or plans. \n \n                                                            FACTS \n                                                      \nBased upon the facts and the representations made, the Fund is a qualified settlement \nfund (QSF) as described in section 468B and the regulations thereunder.  The Fund \nwas created in Year 5 to resolve an administrative proceeding brought by the Securities \nand Exchange Commission (Commission) against X, Y and Z relating to investment \nadvice provided to certain mutual funds.  The proceeding related to the inadequate or \nnonexistent disclosure of X, Y and Z\u2019s policies allowing market timing trading of mutual \nfund units (units) and to the oversight, monitoring or management of trades of such \nunits (trades) from at least Year 1 through the middle of Year 4.   \n \nIn an Order Instituting Proceedings (OIP) directed at X, Y and Z, and in related OIPs \ndirected at individuals A, B, C & D, the Commission alleged that X made various \nmaterial omissions and misrepresentations regarding market timing of funds and that X, \nY, Z, A, B, C and D committed certain other wrongful acts relating to trades in the units.  \nImproper market timing impairs the value of mutual fund shares by depressing their net \nasset value.  Improper market timing also generates excess trading volume and thus \nincreases the fees mutual funds must pay to investment advisors such as X and Y and \ndistributors such as Z.  Thus, the conduct of X, Y, Z, A, B, C and D resulted in damage \n \nPLR-111169-06 \n \n \n3 \nto the investors and a loss of capital.  The Commission, based on the improper conduct \ndescribed above and the resulting damage to mutual fund investors, sought profit \ndisgorgement and civil penalties.  After investigation and negotiations, X, Y, Z, A, B, C \nand D agreed to pay $A to settle the Commission\u2019s claims.  Y will also pay post-\njudgment interest, from 30 days after entry of the OIP through the date of distribution to \ninvestors, at a rate the OIP specifies.  Pursuant to section 308(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley \nAct of 2002 (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7246), the OIPs established  \u201cFair Funds\u201d for the \ndisgorgement, penalty and post-judgment interest components of the settlement, thus \npermitting all of those components to be paid to injured investors.  The Fund will \ndistribute $B, the disgorgement and penalty Y and Z agreed to pay.  The OIP \nestablished a separate Fair Fund to distribute the disgorgement and penalty X agreed to \npay, although such amounts will actually be paid by Y as X\u2019s successor.  This separate \nFair Fund will also distribute the post-judgment interest described above, and the \nsettlement payments by A, B, C and D.         \n \nThose investors holding units of the mutual funds during any portion of the time period \nspecified in the OIP will be eligible to receive distributions from the Fund.  The \ndistributions will be based on the Commission\u2019s orders.  The amount available for \ndistribution is the net settlement pool, which includes the sum of $B (the amount \ntransferred by Y and Z into the Fund) and the amount of net income earned by the \nFund.  Investors will be allocated portions of the net settlement pool.  The Commission\u2019s \norders provide that investors will first receive their proportionate share of losses suffered \nby the mutual funds due to market timing and then a proportionate share of advisory \nfees paid by the mutual funds that suffered such losses during the period of market \ntiming. \n \n                                              LAW AND ANALYSIS \n \nRuling 1.  Section 1.468B-2(l)(2)(i) of the Treasury Regulations provides that, in general, \ndistributions by a QSF are subject to certain information reporting and withholding \nrequirements. Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.468B-2(l)(2)(ii) provides that a QSF must make a return \nfor, or must withhold tax on, a distribution to a claimant if one or more transferors would \nhave been required to make a return or withhold tax had that transferor made the \ndistribution directly to the claimant. The regulations further provide that, for purposes of \nsections 6041(a) and 6041A, if a QSF makes a distribution on behalf of a transferor or a \nclaimant, the fund is deemed to make the distribution to the recipient of that payment or \ndistribution in the course of a trade or business. In such a situation, the QSF is also \ndeemed to have made the distribution to the transferor or claimant.  See Treas. Reg.  \n \u00a7 1.468B-2(l)(2)(ii)(C)-(D).   \n \nSection 6041 requires all persons engaged in a trade or business and making payment \nin the course of such trade or business to another person, of rent, salaries, wages, \npremiums, annuities, compensations, remunerations, emoluments, or other fixed or \ndeterminable gains, profits, and income of $600 or more in any taxable year, to file an \n \nPLR-111169-06 \n \n \n4 \ninformation return with the Service and to furnish an information statement to the payee. \nTreas. Reg. \u00a7 1.6041-1(c) provides that payments are fixed when they are paid in \namounts definitely predetermined. Income is determinable whenever there is a basis of  \ncalculation by which the amount to be paid may be ascertained. Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.6041-\n1(a)(2) requires a payor to report section 6041 amounts on Form 1099.  Thus,  \npayments that are not fixed or determinable are not subject to information reporting \nunder section 6041.      \n \nAmounts a taxpayer receives to restore a loss of capital are not income except to the \nextent that the payment exceeds the taxpayer\u2019s basis in the injured property that is the \nsubject of the payment.  Raytheon Production Corp. v. Commissioner, 144 F.2d 110 (1st \nCir. 1944).   Fund payments to investors for losses the mutual funds suffered from \nmarket timing appear to constitute compensation for a loss of capital.  Market timing \npermitted by X, Y and Z depressed the net asset value of mutual fund shares; \ncompensation from the Fund will compensate, at least partially, for this damage.  \nBecause the Fund has no access to the investors\u2019 tax basis in their mutual fund \naccounts and has no need or occasion to collect information on tax basis, the Fund is \nunable to calculate how much of this compensation for mutual fund losses constitutes \nfixed or determinable income.  Accordingly, the Fund has no information reporting \nobligations under section 6041 for such compensation.  \n \nAs noted above, a portion of the Fund payments will compensate investors for improper \nadvisory fees paid by the mutual funds.  Although such payments may constitute gross \nincome to investors, the Fund cannot (due to limitations on its data collecting authority) \ndetermine whether the payments will constitute gross income to investors.  The \npayments, therefore, are not \u201cfixed or determinable\u201d income within the meaning of the \nregulations under section 6041.  Accordingly, subject to the exception noted below \nregarding distributions to qualified retirement plan participants, the Fund has no \ninformation reporting obligations under section 6041. \n \nThe Fund states that it may make a certain number of distributions directly to \nparticipants in tax-qualified retirement plans.  Section 72 of the Code controls the \ntaxation of such distributions, and the distributions must be reported on Form 1099-R \npursuant to section 6041, subject to the $600 reporting threshold set forth in section \n6041(a) and Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.6041-1(a)(1)(i)(B). \n \nRuling 2.  Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.468B-2(l)(2)(ii) provides that a QSF must make a return for a \ndistribution to a claimant if one or more transferors would have been required to make a \nreturn had that transferor made the distribution directly to the claimant. \n \nSection 6045(a) provides generally that every person doing business as a broker shall, \nwhen required by the Secretary, make a return in accordance with such regulations as \nthe Secretary may prescribe.  Section 6045(c) defines the term \"broker\" to include a \ndealer, a barter exchange, and any other person who (for a consideration) regularly acts \n \nPLR-111169-06 \n \n \n5 \nas a middleman with respect to property or services.  The regulations further define the \nterm \"broker\" to mean a person that, in the ordinary course of a trade or business during \nthe calendar year, stands ready to effect sales to be made by others.  See Treas. Reg. \n\u00a7 1.6045-1(a)(1). \n \nTreas. Reg. \u00a7 1.6045-1(c)(2) provides generally that a broker shall make an information \nreturn for each sale effected by the broker in the ordinary course of the broker\u2019s trade or \nbusiness.  Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.6045-1(a)(9) defines a sale as any disposition of securities, \ncommodities, regulated futures contracts, or forward contracts for cash, and as \nincluding redemptions of stock, retirements of indebtedness and entering into short \nsales.   \n \nThe Fund\u2019s payments to investors do not result from a \u201csale\u201d as that term is defined \nabove.  The Fund, therefore, has no information reporting obligations under section \n6045 with respect to these payments.       \n \nRuling 3.  Section 6049(a) provides that every person who (1) makes payments of \ninterest aggregating $10 or more to any other person during any calendar year, or (2)  \nreceives payments of interest as a nominee and who makes payments aggregating $10 \nor more during any calendar year to any other person with respect to the interest so \nreceived, shall make a return according to the forms or regulations prescribed by the \nSecretary. \n \nSection 6049 (b)(1) provides that the term \u201cinterest\u201d includes interest on any obligation \nissued in registered form or of a type offered to the public, other than any obligation with \na maturity (at issue) of a year or less which is held by a corporation.  Pursuant to  \nsection 6049(b)(1)(e), \u201cinterest\u201d also includes interest on deposits with brokers (as \ndefined in section 6045(c)). \n \nThe Fund distributions in the present case do not relate to deposits with brokers or \nobligations issued in registered form, and do not otherwise qualify as interest within the \nmeaning of section 6049(b).  This is so even though interest earnings have accrued on \nthe funds to be paid to investors, from the time Y and Z paid such funds to the Fund.  \nThe Fund distributions to investors relate to violations of securities law and \ncompensation for financial harm, not to obligations issued in registered form or other \ninstruments that generate interest as section 6049 defines that term.  Accordingly, the \nFund has no information reporting obligations under section 6049 regarding its \ndistributions to the investors.     \n \nRuling 4.  Section 3406(a)(1) generally provides that, in the case of any reportable \npayment, if (A) the payee fails to furnish his or her TIN to the payor in the manner \nrequired, (B) the Secretary notifies the payor that the TIN furnished by the payee is \nincorrect, (C) there has been a notified payee underreporting of interest and dividends, \nor (D) there has been a certification failure (collectively referred to as \"payee failures\"), \n \nPLR-111169-06 \n \n \n6 \nthen the payor shall deduct and withhold from such reportable payment a \u201cbackup \nwithholding\u201d amount totaling 28% of such payment.   \n \nSection 3406(b)(1) provides that the term \"reportable payment\" means any reportable \ninterest or dividend payment and any other reportable payment.  Section 3406(b)(3) \nprovides that the term \"other reportable payment\" includes any payment of a kind, and \nto a payee, required to be shown on a return under section 6041 or 6045.   \n  \nIn light of Rulings One through Three above, only direct payments by the Fund to \nparticipants in tax-qualified plans will be reportable payments subject to backup \nwithholding under section 3406.  In order to meet its obligations under section 3406, \nand to include TINs on information returns it must provide for these reportable \npayments, the Fund plans to obtain those TINs from one of the following sources: the \nplan administrator, the mutual funds in which the participants invested, or the transfer \nagents that provide services to the administrator or mutual funds.   \n \nObtaining the TINs in this manner should prove more reliable and less burdensome and \ncostly to the Fund than soliciting the TINs from the plan participants.  In light of the \nauthority it has been granted by the Commission, the Fund will be able to obtain the \nTINs of plan participants from the plan administrators, mutual funds or transfer agents.  \nThe Fund will not be required to solicit TINs from the participants for purposes of \napplying the backup withholding rules of section 3406. \n \nExcept as expressly provided herein, no opinion is expressed or implied concerning the \ntax consequences of any aspect of any transaction or item discussed or referenced in \nthis letter.  Furthermore, this letter expresses no opinion about information reporting \nrequirements for Fund distributions that are not made directly to the injured investors. \nThis letter also expresses no opinion about the income tax consequences to investors \nof Fund distributions. \n \nThis ruling is directed only to the taxpayer requesting it.

Specifically, your letter \nrequests the Service\u2019s consent to change X\u2019s classification from an association taxable \nas a corporation to a disregarded entity effective Date3.\nFACTS\nThe information submitted states that on Date1, X was formed under the laws of \nState as a limited liability company.  Effective Date2, X filed a Form 8832, Entity \nClassification Election, to change its classification to an association taxable as a \ncorporation.  On Date3, X had a change in ownership of more than fifty percent that \nwould satisfy \u00a7 301.7701-3(c)(1)(iv).  On Date4, X filed a timely Form 8832 to change its \nclassification to a disregarded entity effective Date3.  The IRS Service Center denied \nPLR-131665-18 \n2\nthe change in classification due to the prior classification change effective on Date2, \nwhich was within the 60-month period set forth in \u00a7 301.7701-3(c)(1)(iv).\nLAW AND ANALYSIS\nSection 301.7701-3(a) provides that a business entity that is not classified as a \ncorporation under \u00a7 301.7701-2(b)(1), (3), (4), (5), (6), (7) or (8) (an eligible entity) can \nelect its classification for federal tax purposes as provided in \u00a7 301.7701-3.  Elections \nare necessary only when an eligible entity does not want to be classified under the \ndefault classification or when an eligible entity chooses to change its classification.\nSection 301.7701-3(b)(1) provides that, unless the entity elects otherwise, a \ndomestic eligible entity is (i) a partnership if it has two or more members; or (ii) \ndisregarded as an entity separate from its owner if it has a single owner.\nSection 301.7701-3(c)(1)(i) provides that, except as provided in \u00a7 301.7701-\n3(c)(1)(iv) and (v), an eligible entity may elect to be classified other than as provided \nunder \u00a7 301.7701-3(b), or to change its classification, by filing Form 8832 with the \nservice center designated on Form 8832.\nSection 301.7701-3(c)(1)(iii) provides that an election made under \u00a7 301.7701-\n3(c)(1)(i) will be effective on the date specified by the entity on the Form 8832 or on the \ndate filed if no date is specified on the election form.  The effective date specified on \nForm 8832 cannot be more than 75 days prior to the date on which the election is filed \nand cannot be more than 12 months after the date on which the election is filed.\nSection 301.7701-3(c)(1)(iv)  provides that, if an eligible entity makes an election \nunder \u00a7 301.7701-3(c)(1)(i) to change its classification, the entity cannot change its \nclassification by election again during the sixty months succeeding the effective date of \nthe election.  However, the Commissioner may permit the entity to change its \nclassification by election within the sixty months if more than fifty percent of the \nownership interests in the entity as of the effective date of the subsequent election are \nowned by persons that did not own any interests in the entity on the filing date or on the \neffective date of the entity\u2019s prior election.  \nCONCLUSION\nBased solely on the information submitted and the representations made, we \nconsent to X changing its classification to a disregarded entity for federal tax purposes \neffective Date3 under \u00a7 301.7701-3(c)(1)(iv).  X should file a Form 8832, Entity \nClassification Election, with the appropriate service center and attach a copy of this \nletter to the election.\nPLR-131665-18 \n3\nExcept as expressly provided herein, we express or imply no opinion concerning \nthe federal tax consequences of any transaction or item discussed or referenced in this \nletter.

For the reasons \nset forth below, we conclude that Entity 1 is required to comply with the reporting \nrequirements of I.R.C. \u00a7 6050P because the discharge of indebtedness was the result \nof an identifiable event listed in Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.6050P-1(b)(2).\nPLR-109624-13\n2\nFacts\nEntity 1 is a financial institution chartered by State X engaged in, among other activities, \nthe business of extending credit to consumers for the purchase of certain assets.  Entity \n1 is the successor by merger to another financial institution that had engaged in similar \nconsumer credit activities as Entity 1 and which, prior to the merger, entered into an \nagreement with Entity 2 to engage in certain remedies for collection and enforcement of \nthe retail sale installment contracts relating to the consumer loans.\nEntity 1 filed a complaint in the Circuit Court of State X on Date 1 to recover a deficiency \nbalance remaining on a consumer credit account after Collection Remedy had been \ntaken.  The defendant filed a motion to dismiss the complaint.  The court on Date 2 \nissued an order dismissing the complaint.  Also on Date 2, the defendant filed a \ncounterclaim, which she later amended, that became the basis for the continuing \nlitigation.  On Date 3, the defendant/counterclaimant filed a Motion for Class \nCertification.  The parties entered into a Settlement and Release Agreement \n(\u201cAgreement\u201d) on Date 4 and, on the same date, filed with the court a Joint Motion for \nPreliminary Approval of Class Action Settlement Agreement. The following day, the \ncourt entered an Order Preliminarily Approving Class Action Settlement (\u201cPreliminary \nOrder\u201d).  On Date 5, the court entered an Order Finally Approving Class Action \nSettlement and Certifying a Class for Settlement Purposes (\u201cFinal Order\u201d) and also \nentered its Final Judgment in the case. \nThe Preliminary Order states that the parties have \u201cexecuted the Agreement in order to \nsettle and resolve the Litigation as between them and the proposed Settlement Class.\u201d  \nThe Preliminary Order states that the \u201cCourt finds preliminarily\u2026that under [State X] \nlaw, [Entity 1] would not accrue any deficiency balance or collect any deficiency \njudgment\u2026[regarding] \u2018presale notices\u2019 that failed to comply with the [State X] UCC.\u201d  \nThe Preliminary Order further states that Entity 1 would be permitted to \u201coffset \ndeficiency balances and judgments against damages claimed\u201d by the counterclaimant \nor class action members, under the law of State X.  The Preliminary Order specifies that \nits findings are \u201c[p]ursuant to the Agreement, and for purposes of the Settlement only.\u201d \nThe Final Order incorporates the Preliminary Order and the parties\u2019 Agreement. The \nterms of the Agreement specified the creation of a qualified settlement fund, and the \ndistribution from the fund to the class members and their counsel.  The Agreement also\nspecified that Entity 1 would submit a request for a private letter ruling to the IRS \nrequesting a ruling that Entity 1 is not required to file information returns relating to \ndistributions from the settlement fund.\nLaw and Analysis\nSection 6050P of the Internal Revenue Code requires that an applicable entity report \nany discharges (in whole or in part) of indebtedness of any person in excess\nPLR-109624-13\n3\nof $600.00.  The report is to include the name, address and taxpayer identification \nnumber of each person whose indebtedness is discharged, the date of the discharge \nand the amount of indebtedness discharged.  In addition, section 1.6050P-1(b)(2) of the \nTreasury regulations provides that a discharge of indebtedness occurs if one of eight \n\u201cidentifiable events\u201d that the regulation defines takes place.\nOf the identifiable events, only two have a potential bearing on the requested ruling.  \nThe first possible event, section 1.6050P-1(b)(2)(F), provides that an identifiable event \nexists when the applicable financial entity and debtor agree to discharge the \nindebtedness for less than full consideration.  To establish consideration, there must be \na performance or a return promised which has been bargained for by the parties.  \nRestatement (Second) Contracts \u00a7 71(1) (1981).  In this case, Entity 1 and the debtor-\nclass members agreed to the entry of a judgment, approved and supervised by the \ncourt, which incorporates the parties\u2019 Agreement by which Entity 1 will write off all \nremaining debt balances as part of the overall settlement of the pending litigation.  This \nappears, on its face, to be the identifiable event described in subsection (F) of the \nregulations.  \nThe request for PLR submitted on behalf of Entity 1 argues that the Agreement does not \nreflect a mere agreement of the parties, or any other identifiable event, but rather is \nsimply a recognition that the write-off of the deficiency balances was required under the \nlaw of State X.  The law of State X provides that, in a case where the Collection \nRemedy did not strictly comply with notice requirements, there is an absolute bar on \ncollecting any remaining deficiency balances.  The defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss filed in \nresponse to Entity 1\u2019s complaint, and the defendant\u2019s counterclaim, alleged that Entity 1 \nviolated various aspects of the notice requirements in the presale notices sent to the \nclass members as part of the Collection Remedy.  The settlement Agreement \nacknowledges that the \u201cclaims are premised on state law which bars the recovery of \ndeficiency balances in certain circumstances\u201d and \u201c[t]he settlement consideration \nprovided in the Agreement is determined by application of state law.\u201d  The Agreement \ncontains no admission or concession by Entity 1 with respect to the claims or defenses \nalleged in the class action counterclaim.  The Agreement contains a specific denial of \nliability in paragraph 1, which denial of liability was incorporated into the Preliminary \nOrder and Final Order.  The Final Order recites that by entering into the settlement \nAgreement, the parties shall not be deemed to have admitted or conceded liability with \nrespect to any of the pending claims or defenses alleged.  \nEntity 1 contends that the order granting the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss, coupled \nwith the Preliminary and Final Orders approving the settlement, constitutes a \nsubstantive ruling that the presale notices were defective and the deficiencies, \ntherefore, were not legally accrued or collectible.  The original order dismissing the \ndefendant from the case, however, was a one-sentence order with no substantive \nfindings or memorandum opinion, issued simultaneously with the filing of the \ndefendant\u2019s counterclaim.  The Preliminary Order approving the class action settlement \nPLR-109624-13\n4\nspecifically states that the findings are \u201cPursuant to the Agreement, and for the \npurposes of the Settlement only.\u201d  The Preliminary Order was drafted by the parties and \nsubmitted to the court for signature, rather than an order that resulted from an \nindependent judicial investigation into the allegations and defenses of the parties.  Entity \n1 has never made any admission regarding the alleged inadequacy of the presale \nnotices.  It vigorously pursued the litigation, including filing a Motion for Summary \nJudgment, throughout the pendency of the case.  It was only by entering into a \nsettlement agreement with the class members that Entity 1 gave up its disputed claims \nto deficiency amounts.  \nAlthough the application of the law of State X regarding the adequacy of the presale \nnotices may have been a factor in the parties\u2019 decision to settle the litigation, such \nconsiderations are typical of parties\u2019 assessment of litigation hazards in arriving at a \nnegotiated settlement.  As the Preliminary Order states, the parties entered into the \nAgreement \u201cwhich memorializes the Parties\u2019 negotiations and agreed-upon settlement\u201d \nof the litigation.  The Agreement states that Entity 1 entered into the Agreement \nbecause Entity 1 \u201cdesires to settle the claims being asserted against it in the \nLitigation\u2026for the purpose of avoiding the burden, expense, and uncertainty of \ncontinuing litigation.\u201d  The fact that the terms of the Agreement were approved and \nincorporated into the Circuit Court\u2019s Preliminary Order or Final Order does not serve to \ncovert the discharge of the debt from being entered into voluntarily to one forced by \noperation of state law.  The Settlement and Release Agreement should be taken on its \nface, as an agreement between Entity 1 and the debtors to discharge the indebtedness \nat less than full consideration for the purpose of resolving the pending litigation.  \nTherefore, section 1.6050P-1(b)(2)(F) applies.   \nThe second possible event, section 1.6050P-1(b)(2)(G), provides that a discharge of \nindebtedness exists where a creditor discontinues collection activity pursuant to a \ndecision by the creditor or a defined policy of the creditor.  According to section \n1.6050P-1(b)(2)(iii), a creditor\u2019s defined policy includes both a written policy and the \ncreditor\u2019s established business practice.  In this case, the cancellation of indebtedness \nis not a result of any defined policy or business practice of Entity 1, but rather by its \ndecision to discontinue collection action as part of settling the litigation.  This decision \ntherefore may fall within subsection (G).  In any event, even if subsection (G) of the \nregulation did not apply, the event set forth in regulation subsection (F), as set forth \nabove, does apply and the section 6050P reporting requirements must be met.\nConclusion\nBased solely on the information provided and the representations made, Entity 1 is \nrequired to file Forms 1099-C with respect to the write-off of balances and charges \npursuant to its settlement agreement because the discharge was the result of an \nidentifiable event listed in section 1.6050P-1(b)(2).\nPLR-109624-13\n5\nExcept as expressly provided herein, no opinion is expressed or implied concerning the \ntax consequences of any aspect of any transaction or item discussed or referenced in \nthis letter.\nThis ruling is directed only to the taxpayer requesting it.

There currently are eight Year 1 trusts remaining with trustor\u2019s\ngrandchildren as the sole current income beneficiaries.  Each trust owns undivided\n2\nPLR-133378-01\ninterest in a assets and substantial portfolio of investment securities and will terminate\nupon the earlier of the death of the grandchild or 21 years after the death of the last\nchild.\nDuring the early Year 2, the Corporate Trustee became increasingly concerned that the\norderly control of the a assets might be seriously disrupted if undivided interests passed\nout of the common control upon the death of a third generation income beneficiary and\nthe resulting trust terminated. In Year 3, the Trustee decided to contribute all of the a \nassets to a partnership.\nThe Partnership\u2019s original Limited Partnership Agreement (LPA) was executed on Date\n1, and obligated each of the partners to contribute their a assets to the Partnership in\nexchange for limited partnership interests.  Due to the Trustee\u2019s concern that certain\nbeneficiaries of the trusts would oppose the limited partnership agreement, the\nagreement was made contingent upon obtaining court approval.  It was also made\ncontingent upon obtaining a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service that the\npartnership was a partnership for federal tax purposes; this requirement was\nsubsequently eliminated as unnecessary after the promulgation of the regulations under\nsections 301.7701-1 through 301.7701-3.  \nThe state court litigation took several years to resolve.  Ultimately, on Date 2, the court\nentered an order requiring the Trustee to execute a LPA substantially similar to the\nAmended and Restated LPA previously submitted to the court.  Although the Amended\nand Restated LPA contained numerous changes from the original LPA no change was\nmade to the partners\u2019 obligation to contribute their a assets to the partnership. The\ncourt authorized the Trustee to make further changes to the Amended and Restated\nLPA prior to the formation of the partnership, subject to the right of an interested party\nto object and hearing by the court.  \nThe Final LPA, which contained minor changes to the Amended and Restated LPA,\nwas executed by all parties on Date 3.  The partnership was formed, and the a assets\nwere contributed to the partnership on Date 4.  Although the execution of the Final LPA\ncould have occurred any time after Date 2, Date 3 was chosen because that was the\ndate on which interested trust beneficiaries, the trustee and persons involved in\nmanaging the a assets have traditionally met.  In addition, the Trustee wanted to utilize\nthe interim period to make sure that all administrative details were given proper\nattention, including necessary changes to computer systems and accounting\nprocedures.  Date 2 is prior to June 8, 1997, and Date 4 is subsequent to it.\nLAW AND ANALYSIS \nSection 1063 of the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, extended from 5 to 7 years the period\nduring which precontribution gain is recognized if property contributed to a partnership\nis distributed in-kind.  The amendment applies to property contributed to a partnership\nafter its June 8, 1997 effective date.  It does not apply, however, to any property\ncontributed pursuant to a written binding contract in effect on June 8, 1997, and at all\n3\nPLR-133378-01\ntimes thereafter before such contribution if such contract provides for the contribution of\na fixed amount of property.  \nCONCLUSION \nBased solely on the facts submitted and the representations made, we conclude that\nthe Partners of X had a binding contract in effect on June 8, 1997, to contribute a\nassets to X.  Accordingly, we conclude that Section 1063 of the Taxpayer Relief Act of\n1997, does not apply and that A will not recognize pre-contribution gain under section\n704(c)(1)(B) or section 737(b)(1) as a result of the in-kind distribution of a assets on or\nafter Date 5.\nExcept as specifically set forth above, no opinion is expressed or implied as to\nthe federal income tax consequences of the transaction described above under any\nother provision of the Code.\nThis ruling is directed only to the taxpayer requesting it. Section 6110(k)(3) of the Code\nprovides that it may not be used or cited as precedent. \nSincerely, \nDavid R.

The rulings concern the interplay of the rules in \nsubchapter T of the Internal Revenue Code (concerning the taxation of cooperatives \nand their patrons) and the calculation of the section 199 deduction for certain \ncooperatives contained in section 199(d)(3). \nTaxpayer is a farmers\u2019 cooperative organized under the Laws of State A. \nTaxpayer is a grain marketing cooperative serving farmers located in ------counties in \nRegion.  Taxpayer was organized in ------- by grain growers interested in expanding the \nmarket for their grain.  In particular, they thought that through cooperative efforts they \ncould gain access to the ----------grain market in-------------.  Taxpayer was successful in \ndoing so.  Over the years, it has established a reputation as a reliable source of high \nquality wheat and barley.  In -------, Taxpayer purchased the agronomy business and \nequipment of ---------------------and entered into the farm supply business.  In -------, \nTaxpayer entered into the seed business. \nPLR-107084-10\n2\nFarmers in the Region principally raise wheat and barley.  During its fiscal year \nended -------------------, Taxpayer\u2019s grain sales were approximately $-------million.  In ------\n-------, Taxpayer purchased approximately -----million bushels of wheat and barley from \nits members and others.  Principal grains marketed were soft white wheat (-----million \nbushels), dark northern spring wheat (-- million bushels), hard red winter wheat (----\nmillion bushels) and barley (---million bushels).  Taxpayer also provides farm supplies to \nits members and others.  Supply division sales totaled approximately $-----million, \nincluding fertilizer, chemicals, seed and related services. \nTaxpayer\u2019s \u201cmembers\u201d are producers of grain who do business with it.  At ---------\n-------------------, Taxpayer had ------members.  \nTaxpayer is organized and operated on a cooperative basis.   The State A \ncooperative association statute describes cooperative associations as being organized \n\u201cfor mutual welfare\u201d and the businesses of cooperatives as being operated \u201con the \ncooperative plan.\u201d  ---------------------.    \nMore specifically, the statute provides:\n\u201cThe directors may apportion the net earnings [of a cooperative \nassociation] by paying dividends upon the paid-up capital stock at a rate \nnot exceeding eight percent per annum.  They may set aside reasonable \nreserves out of such net earnings for any association purpose.  The \ndirectors may, however, distribute all or any portion of the net earnings to \nmembers in proportion to the business of each with the association and \nthey may include nonmembers at a rate not exceeding that paid to \nmembers.  The directors may distribute, on a patronage basis, such net \nearnings at different rates on different classes, kinds, or varieties of \nproducts handled.  All dividends declared or other distributions made \nunder this section may, in the discretion of the directors, be in the form of \ncapital stock, capital or equity certificates, book credits, or capital funds of \nthe association.  All unclaimed dividends or distributions authorized under \nthis chapter or funds payable on redeemed stock, equity certificates, book \ncredits, or capital funds shall revert to the association at the discretion of \nthe directors at any time after one year from the end of the fiscal year \nduring which such distributions or redemptions have been declared.\u201d  ------\n---------------------------\nTaxpayer\u2019s Articles of Incorporation authorize Taxpayer to engage in the grain \nbusiness for its members, to \u201cexercise generally the powers customarily exercised by \ncooperative associations\u201d and to do so \u201con a nonprofit cooperative basis as agent for its \nmembers.\u201d  Articles of Incorporation, Article 2, Section 1.  Taxpayer\u2019s Bylaws repeat \nthis, stating that Taxpayer \u201cshall, at all times, be operated on a cooperative basis for the \nmutual benefits of its members.\u201d  Bylaws, Article 8, Section 1.  \nPLR-107084-10\n3\nThe Articles of Incorporation authorize Taxpayer to issue a single class of \ncommon stock.  Articles of Incorporation, Article 6, Section 1.  That common stock has a \npar value of $30 per share and is entitled to receive a noncumulative dividend of not \nmore than 8 percent per share as determined by the Board of Directors of Taxpayer.  \nThe common stock is membership stock.  Each member of Taxpayer is required to \npurchase one share of common stock.  Bylaws, Article 3, Section 2.  Taxpayer\u2019s Bylaws \nlimit membership to persons that are producers of agricultural products.  Bylaws, Article \n3, Section 1.  The Bylaws provide that \u201c[e]ach holder of Common Stock of the \nAssociation shall be entitled to one (1) vote in all matters wherein the shareholders of \nthis Association shall be entitled to vote regardless of the number of shares of Common \nStock owned by each such shareholder.\u201d  Bylaws, Article 9, Section 2.  At-------- ----------\n-------, there were --------shares of common stock issued and outstanding, entitled in the \naggregate to a dividend of not more than $--------per annum.\nTaxpayer\u2019s Articles of Incorporation also authorize Taxpayer \u201cto establish book \ncredits, capital funds and other allocated reserves to provide funds for corporate \npurposes in the manner provided by the Bylaws by retains from net margins or \nproceeds otherwise payable to the members or patrons, or by other methods of \ncollection.\u201d  Articles of Incorporation, Article 7, Section 1.  Book credits are issued as the \nnoncash portion of the patronage dividends paid by Taxpayer to its members.  They \nprovide a significant source of equity capital for financing Taxpayer\u2019s business.  At -------\n-------------------, the balance of book credits outstanding was $-------------. \nTaxpayer allocates and distributes its earnings each year from business done \nwith or for members to its members in the form of patronage dividends.  Article 8 of \nTaxpayer\u2019s Bylaws describes how Taxpayer computes and pays patronage refunds.  In \npertinent part, Section 3 provides:\n\u201cSection 3.  Obligation to Allocate Net Margins.  Each business patronage \ntransaction between the Association and a member shall be subject to and \ninclude as a part of its terms, the obligation of the Association to allocate \nas patronage dividends to such member, its net margin for each fiscal \nyear \u2026 to the extent attributable to the business patronage by such \nmembers for such period.  All such net margins of the Association from \nbusiness patronage by its members shall be allocated and credited to the \naccounts of such members on a basis proportionate to the quantity or \nvalue of their individual business patronage with the Association.\u201d \nThat section of the Bylaws goes on to provide that Taxpayer \u201cshall allocate net margins \nas patronage dividends to members separately by department.\u201d\n\u201cThe net margin of the Grain Marketing Department shall be allocated, as \nprovided above, based upon the number of pounds of all grains marketed \nby members.  The net margins of the Handling and Storage Department \nand the Farm Supply Department shall each be allocated, as provided \nPLR-107084-10\n4\nabove based upon the dollar value of all business with members.\u201d  \n(Bylaws, Article 8, Section 3).\nConsistent with these directions, Taxpayer allocates patronage dividends each \nyear on the basis three departments:  grain marketing (with patronage dividends \nallocated based upon pounds), handling and storage (with patronage dividends \nallocated based on dollars of storage and handling fees paid by each member) and farm \nsupply (with patronage dividends allocated based on dollars of supplies and service \npurchases by each member). \nArticle 8, Section 4 of the Bylaws authorizes Taxpayer to pay patronage \ndividends in cash and written notices of allocation (referred to by Taxpayer as \u201cbook \ncredits\u201d).  The book credits may be qualified or nonqualified.  Over the years, Taxpayer \nhas issued both qualified and nonqualified written notices of allocation.\nThe Bylaws direct Taxpayer to retain any net margins attributable to business \ndone with nonmembers not dealing with Taxpayer on a patronage basis and to any \nnonpatronage business (including any extraneous business with the federal government \nor its agencies).  Bylaws, Article 8, Sections 10 and 11.  Because Taxpayer does not do \nbusiness with any nonmember patrons on a patronage basis, Taxpayer retains all net \nmargins attributable to nonmember business.  The amount of business conducted with \nnonmembers varies from year to year.  In recent years, nonmember business has \nconstituted approximately ----percent of Taxpayer\u2019s marketing business.  \nTaxpayer\u2019s Bylaws address what is to be done in the event of a loss.  In general, \nthe Bylaws permit losses to be netted between allocation units subject to some \nlimitations.  Bylaws, Article 8, Section 14.  The Bylaws further provide that losses in a \ndepartment \u201cshall be allocated to all members who patronized such department or \nclassification on the same basis as net margins are distributable hereunder.\u201d  Bylaws, \nArticle 8, Section 12.  \nIn the event of dissolution, the Articles of Incorporation provide generally that \nassets shall be distributed in the following order of priority:  first, to pay all debts; \nsecond, to pay holders of book credits an amount equal to the stated dollar amount; \nthird, to pay common stockholders an amount equal to the par value; fourth, to pay \ncurrent year patronage dividends, and fifth, to pay any allocated reserves to the persons \nto whom they are allocated.  If any assets then remain, they:\n\u201c\u2026 shall be distributed among the members of the Association in their \nrespective proportion equal to the ratio that each member\u2019s dollar value of \ncombined marketing and purchasing through the Association during the \nthree (3) year period immediately preceding the date of such distribution \nshall bear to the total dollar value of all members combined marketing and \nPLR-107084-10\n5\npurchasing through the Association during such period by all members at \nsuch time.\u201d  (Articles of Incorporation, Article 8, Section 8). \nThis ruling relates to Taxpayer\u2019s grain marketing activities.  Taxpayer conducts \nits grain marketing through---------elevators   Most of the grain that Taxpayer markets is \ndestined for the bulk --------- market.   Taxpayer occasionally sells barley locally for \nlivestock feed.  In such instances, the customer will pick up the barley by truck at \nTaxpayer\u2019s elevator and Taxpayer will load it out for them.  However, as in the case of \nwheat, most of the barley that Taxpayer markets is shipped by barge and is ultimately \ndestined for the --------- market. \nTaxpayer\u2019s patronage grain business consists of buying grain from members, \nhandling and storing the grain at its elevators, and selling the grain to customers.  The \nprincipal issue in this ruling request relates to the characterization for purposes of \nsubchapter T of the Code and section 199 of the amounts (referred to in this ruling as \n\u201cgrain payments\u201d) that Taxpayer pays its members for their grain when it acquires the \ngrain for marketing on a patronage basis.  For purposes of this ruling, the term \u201cgrain \npayments\u201d does not include any amounts paid to persons not entitled to share in \npatronage dividends.  For purposes of this ruling, the term \u201cgrain payments\u201d also does \nnot include patronage dividends paid to members of Taxpayer with respect to grain\nmarketed for them.  \nTaxpayer does not operate on a pooling basis.  Thus, Taxpayer\u2019s marketing \nproceeds are not shared equally on the basis of patronage and distributed in the form of \nharvest advances and progress payments with a final settlement after the pool closes \nas they would be if Taxpayer pooled.  Commodity price risk does not automatically shift \nfrom Taxpayer\u2019s members to a pool at the time of harvest.  Rather, it remains with \nmembers until they sell their grain to Taxpayer for marketing.  \nTaxpayer pays each member a market price for his or her grain.  What that \nmarket price is depends upon where, when and how a member chooses to sell his or \nher grain to Taxpayer.  That market price is determined without regard to the actual net \nproceeds from marketing grain.  Payments are made in cash (by check) and occur \nthroughout the year as members sell grain to Taxpayer for marketing and are paid \npursuant to the terms of their individual contracts.  \nAfter purchasing grain from members, Taxpayer then markets each member\u2019s \ngrain along with the grain of all of its other members in the manner that it judges will \nproduce the best return.  After year end, when net earnings for the year have been \ndetermined (after treating amounts paid to members for their grain as a cost of the \ngrain), Taxpayer pays a patronage dividend to its members with respect to the grain \nthey market through Taxpayer.  \nGrain farmers in the United States historically have retained the decision of to \nwhom, when and how to sell their grain.  The basic choices available to a member \nPLR-107084-10\n6\nselling grain to Taxpayer for marketing on a cooperative basis are:  (i) to sell the grain \nfor Taxpayer\u2019s current cash bid price, (ii) to sell the grain to Taxpayer using a fixed price \nforward contract, or (iii) to sell the grain to Taxpayer using a form of forward contract \nthat leaves the price to be paid for the grain partly open and to be fully determined at a \nlater date.  These choices are similar to those offered farmers by commercial grain \ncompanies, though commercial grain companies do not market grain on a patronage \nbasis and do not pay patronage dividends.\nOne way for a farmer to sell grain to Taxpayer for marketing is to sell the grain to \nTaxpayer and be paid the cash bid price.  Members are responsible for delivering grain \nto one of Taxpayer\u2019s elevators.  Members are responsible for the costs of shipping the \ngrain from there to-------------.  The amount charged to members for handling and \ntransportation is referred to as \u201c---------------------\u201d and \u201cfuel surcharge\u201d and set forth in a \nfootnote on the cash bid schedule.  \nThe cash bid prices are for grain that meets normal quality standards.  Grain is \nweighed and tested when it is delivered by the member.  If the grain includes such \nthings as broken kernels and foreign matter, the weight is adjusted.  If wheat is above or \nbelow certain protein standards, a premium is paid or a discount is charged.  \nA farmer can deliver and sell grain to Taxpayer at the cash bid price at the time \nof harvest, delivering the grain directly from the field.  However, it usually is not \nadvantageous for farmers to sell then since prices often are lowest at harvest.  Many \nfarmers have the capacity to store grain on farm and so can wait until later, when they \nthink that the cash bid price is right, to deliver and sell their grain to Taxpayer.  Other \nfarmers deliver their grain to Taxpayer for storage, not for immediate sale.  The farmers \nretain ownership of the grain in the elevator and pay storage fees to Taxpayer.  Later, \nwhen a farmer believes the cash bid price is right, he or she can sell the grain to \nTaxpayer for marketing on a cooperative basis.  \nA farmer has the option of entering into a fixed price forward contract to sell his \nor her wheat to Taxpayer.  Forward contracts call for delivery of a specified quantity and \nquality of grain, at a specified location, during a specified time period.  Forward \ncontracts can be entered into before the grain is planted, while it is growing or after \nharvest while the grain is being stored on the farm or in an elevator.  The most common \nforward contract used by Taxpayer calls for a fixed price.  \nFarmers interested in entering into a forward contract with Taxpayer for wheat \ncan determine the fixed price Taxpayer is willing to pay for delivery at various times in \nthe future from Taxpayer\u2019s bid schedule for grain.  Taxpayer is able to offer fixed price \nforward contracts for wheat and barley because it can hedge its price exposure by \nentering into corresponding fixed price forward contracts with its customers.\nPLR-107084-10\n7\nFarmers also can enter into forward contracts for wheat where the pricing is left \npartly open for future determination.  This form of contract is referred to by Taxpayer as \na \u201cfutures/cash purchase contract.\u201d  \nIn the contract, one element of the price, the futures price for future delivery has \nbeen determined, but the basis has not been determined.  The basis under this contract \nwill be determined at a time specified by the farmer \u201con or before the delivery period.\u201d  \nThese contracts are not as common, but in recent years Taxpayer has offered this \nalternative in response to requests from its members.  They are only offered to \nmembers.\nOn rare occasions, Taxpayer purchases grain from members on a deferred price \nbasis (referred to by Taxpayer as a \u201cno-price established\u201d basis), where the price is left \ncompletely open.  When Taxpayer purchases grain on this basis, title to the grain \npasses to Taxpayer, and it can sell the grain.  The member retains the right to price the \ngrain at Taxpayer\u2019s cash bid price at a date of his choosing (but not later than a set \ndate).  The benefit to the farmer is that he does not need to pay storage fees while \nwaiting to price the grain since title to the grain passes to Taxpayer.  These contracts \nare used when Taxpayer needs more company-owned grain to fill out a barge shipment.  \nThis option for selling grain to Taxpayer is not generally available to Taxpayer\u2019s \nmembers.\nSome farmers prefer to sell their grain to Taxpayer on a deferred payment basis.  \nGrain sold on that basis might be delivered in October, the price set at that time, but \nwith payment to be made in January.  Ownership of the grain passes to Taxpayer when \nthe grain is delivered or at the time set in the agreement, with payment at a later date.  \nTaxpayer does not have a separate form that it uses for deferred payment \narrangements.  When grain is purchased on that basis, the deferred payment date is \nspecified on its normal contracts.\nIn summary, farmers can lock in prices for their wheat (even before the wheat is \nplanted or while it is growing) at any time if they think that the price is right by using \nfixed price forward contracts.  Some farmers prefer to enter into fixed price contracts \nafter they can estimate the costs of production to lock in a reasonable margin.  If a \nfarmer is happy with the futures price of wheat, but not the basis, the farmer can enter \ninto a forward contract that fixes the futures component of the price, but leaves the \nbasis open.  \nIf farmers think that the cash price is low at the time of harvest, they can harvest \nand store their grain while waiting for the price to improve.  Farmers with grain in \nstorage on the farm or at Taxpayer can then sell grain that is in storage at any time at \nthe cooperative\u2019s cash bid price.  \nThese choices are available to all farmers marketing their grain on a cooperative \nbasis through Taxpayer.  Because of these choices, two neighbors that market the \nPLR-107084-10\n8\nsame quantity and quality of a particular kind of grain through Taxpayer during any year \nwill receive different grain payments depending upon where, when and how they sell \ntheir grain to Taxpayer.  However, they will receive the same patronage dividends with \nrespect to grain marketing.\nFor the fiscal year ended -------------------, Taxpayer\u2019s grain payments to members \nexceeded $----million.  Taxpayer paid patronage dividends to members with respect to \ntheir grain sales, supply purchases and handling and storage of ---------------.  The \npatronage dividends were paid 45 percent in cash and 55 percent in qualified written \nnotices of allocation (book credits).\nTaxpayer historically has treated grain payments made in cash to members as \n\u201cpurchases\u201d for tax purposes and reported them on Schedule A, Line 2 of its Form \n1120-C.  Taxpayer has not treated the grain payments made in cash as \u201cper-unit retain \nallocations paid in money\u201d and therefore has not reported them on Schedule A, Line 4b \nof its Form 1120-C.  It has reported the patronage dividends paid to members as a \npatronage dividend paid in money and qualified written notices of allocation on \nSchedule H, lines 3a and 3b of its Form 1120-C.   \nBecause of this reporting, grain payments paid in cash historically entered into \nthe determination for tax purposes of Taxpayer\u2019s cost of goods sold for tax purposes.  \nAs is customary in the grain business, Taxpayer has valued its grain inventories at year \nend at market for financial statement and tax purposes.\nTaxpayer has not added back grain payments in its section 199 computations for \nprior years.  Taxpayer has not passed any portion of its section 199 deduction through \nto its members in prior years.\nRecent developments have caused Taxpayer to reconsider how it should treat its \ngrain payments for purposes of its section 199 computation.  Taxpayer is seeking \nconfirmation that all grain payments to members that are paid in cash should be \nclassified as \u201cper-unit retain allocations paid in money.\u201d  \nTaxpayer plans to disregard grain payments made to members for purposes of \nits section 199 computation.  Taxpayer may retain all or a portion of its section 199 \ndeduction or it may pass all of that deduction through to its members.\nBased on the foregoing, Taxpayer requests the following rulings:\n1.\nGrain payments to members constitute \u201cper-unit retain allocations paid in money\u201d \nwithin the meaning of section 1382(b)(3) of the Code. \n2.\nFor purposes of computing its section 199 domestic production activities \ndeduction, Taxpayer\u2019s qualified production activities income and taxable income \nPLR-107084-10\n9\nshould, pursuant to section 199(d)(3)(C) of the Code, be computed without\nregard to any deduction for grain payments to members. \nNonexempt subchapter T cooperatives are permitted to exclude or deduct \ndistributions to patrons that qualify as per-unit retain allocations or patronage dividends, \nprovided the distributions other meet the requirements of subchapter T of the Code.\nSection 1388(f) of the Code defines the term \u201cper-unit retain allocation\u201d to mean \n\u201cany allocation, by an organization to which part I of [subchapter T] applies, to a patron \nwith respect to products marketed for him, the amount of which is fixed without \nreference to net earnings of the organization pursuant to an agreement between the \norganization and the patron.\u201d\nPer-unit retain allocations may be made in money, property or certificates.  Per-\nunit retain allocations paid in money and in property are excludable or deductible under \nsection 1382(b)(3) of the Code.  Per-unit retain allocations paid in certificates are \ndeductible under section 1382(b)(3) if the certificates are qualified.  If the certificates are\nnonqualified, the cooperative is permitted a deduction under section 1382(b)(4) (or a tax \nbenefit figured under section 1383) when the certificates are later redeemed.\nSection 1388(a)(1) of the Code provides that the term \u201cpatronage dividend\u201d \nmeans an amount paid to a patron by a cooperative on the basis of the quantity or value \nof business done with or for such patron.  Section 1388(a)(2) provides that a \u201cpatronage \ndividend\u201d is an amount paid \u201cunder an obligation\u201d that must have existed before the \ncooperative received the amount so paid.  Section 1388(a)(3) provides that \u201cpatronage \ndividend\u201d means an amount paid to a patron that is determined by reference to the net \nearnings of the cooperative from business done with or for its patrons.  That section \nfurther provides that a \u201cpatronage dividend\u201d does not include any amount paid to a \npatron to the extent that such amount is out of earnings other than from business done \nwith or for patrons.  Section 1.1382-3(c)(2) of the Income Tax Regulations states that \nincome derived from sources other than patronage means incidental income derived \nfrom sources not directly related to the marketing, purchasing, or service activities of the \ncooperative association.\nPatronage dividends may be paid in money, property or written notices of \nallocation.  Patronage dividends paid in money and in property are excludable or \ndeductible under section 1382(b)(1) of the Code.  Patronage dividends paid in written \nnotices of allocation are deductible under section 1382(b)(1) if the written notices of \nallocation are qualified.  If the notices are nonqualified, the cooperative is permitted a \ndeduction under section 1382(b)(2) (or a tax benefit figured under section 1383) when \nthe notices are later redeemed.\nSection 1388(b) of the Code provides that the term \u201cwritten notice of allocation\u201d \nmeans any capital stock, revolving fund certificate, retain certificate, certificate of \nPLR-107084-10\n10\nindebtedness, letter of advice, or other written notice, which discloses to the recipient \nthe stated dollar amount allocated to him by the organization and the portion thereof, if \nany, which constitutes a patronage dividend.\nFor cooperatives that use pooling, Rev. Rul. 67-333, 1967-2 C.B. 299, provides \nthat pool advances are treated as per-unit retain allocations and the final pool payment, \nmade after net earnings have been determined, is treated as a patronage dividend.\nUnder section 199(d)(3) of the Code, patrons that receive a qualified payment \nfrom a specified agricultural or horticultural cooperative are allowed a deduction for an \namount allocable to their portion of QPAI of the organization received as a qualified \npatronage dividend or per-unit retain allocation which is paid in qualified per-unit retain \ncertificates.  In particular, section 199(d)(3)(F) requires the cooperative to be engaged in \nthe manufacturing, production, growth, or extraction in whole or significant part of any \nagricultural or horticultural product, or in the marketing of agricultural or horticultural \nproducts.  Under section 199(d)(3)(D), in the case of a cooperative engaged in the \nmarketing of agricultural and horticultural products, the cooperative is treated as having \nmanufactured, produced, grown, or extracted (MPGE) in whole or significant part any \nqualifying production property marketed by the cooperative that its patrons have MPGE \n(this is known in the industry as the \u201ccooperative attribution rule\u201d).  In addition, section \n199(d)(3)(A)(ii) requires the cooperative to designate the patron\u2019s portion of the income \nallocable to the QPAI of the organization in a written notice mailed by the cooperative to \nits patrons no later than the 15th day of the ninth month following the close of the tax \nyear.\nUnder section 1.199-6(c) of the regulations, for purposes of determining a \ncooperative\u2019s section 199 deduction, the cooperative\u2019s QPAI and taxable income are \ncomputed without taking into account any deduction allowable under section 1382(b) or \n(c) of the Code (relating to patronage dividends, per-unit retain allocations, and \nnonpatronage distributions).\nAn agricultural or horticultural cooperative is permitted to \u201cpass-through\u201d to its \npatrons all or any portion of its section 199 deduction for the year provided it does so in \nthe manner and within the time limits set by section 199(d)(3) of the Code.  When a\ncooperative passes-through all or any portion of the section 199 deduction, the \ncooperative remains entitled to claim the entire section 199 deduction on its return, but \nis required under section 199(d)(3)(B) to reduce the deduction or exclusion it would \notherwise claim under section 1382(b) for per-unit retain allocations and patronage \ndividends.  \nSection 199(d)(3)(A) of the Code provides that a cooperative passes through an \namount of its section 199 deduction by \u201cidentifying\u201d such amount in a written notice \nmailed to such person during the payment period described in section 1382(d).  \nSection 1382(d) provides that the payment period for a year is the period beginning with \nPLR-107084-10\n11\nthe first day of such taxable year and ending with the fifteenth day of the ninth month \nfollowing the close of such year.\nSection 1.199-6(g) of the regulations provide that in order for a patron to qualify \nfor the section 199 deduction, section 1.199-6(a) requires that the cooperative identify in \na written notice the patron's portion of the section 199 deduction that is attributable to \nthe portion of the cooperative's QPAI for which the cooperative is allowed a section 199 \ndeduction.  This written notice must be mailed by the cooperative to its patrons no later \nthan the 15th day of the ninth month following the close of the taxable year.  The \ncooperative may use the same written notice, if any, that it uses to notify patrons of their \nrespective allocations of patronage dividends, or may use a separate timely written \nnotice(s) to comply with this section.  The cooperative must report the amount of the \npatron's section 199 deduction on Form 1099-PATR, \u201cTaxable Distributions Received \nFrom Cooperatives,\u201d issued to the patron.\nWhile a cooperative is permitted to disregard per-unit retain allocations and \npatronage dividends in its section 199 deduction, section 1.199-6(l) of the regulations \nprovide that a qualified payment received by a patron of a cooperative is not taken into \naccount by the patron for purposes of section 199. \nSection 1.199-6(e) of the regulations defines the term \u201cqualified payment\u201d to \nmean any amount of a patronage dividend or per-unit retain allocation, as described in \nsection 1385(a)(1) or (3) of the Code received by the patron from a cooperative, that is \nattributable to the portion of the cooperative\u2019s QPAI, for which the cooperative is \nallowed a section 199 deduction.  For this purpose, patronage dividends and per-unit \nretain allocations include any advances on patronage and per-unit retains paid in money \nduring the taxable year.\nTaxpayer is a \u201cspecified agricultural or horticultural cooperative\u201d within the \nmeaning of section 199(d)(3)(F) of the Code and section 1.199-6(f) of the regulations.  It \nis an organization \u201cto which part I of subchapter T applies\u201d (i.e., it is a nonexempt \ncooperative to which subchapter T applies).  It is engaged \u201cin the marketing of \nagricultural or horticultural products\u201d (i.e., grain).\nAs a specified agricultural or horticultural cooperative, Taxpayer is entitled to the \nbenefit of section 199(d)(3)(C) of the Code and section 1.199-6(c) of the regulations, \nwhich permit such cooperatives to disregard deductions under section 1382(b) and (c) \nfor purposes of computing QPAI and taxable income for purposes of section 199.  \nSection 1382(b) provides deductions for per-unit retain allocations paid in money, \nproperty and qualified per-unit retain certificates as well as for patronage dividends paid \nin money, property and qualified written notices of allocation.  It also provides for \ndeductions when nonqualified per-unit retain certificates and nonqualified written notices \nof allocation are redeemed.  As a specified agricultural or horticultural cooperative, \nTaxpayer is entitled to the benefit of section 199(d)(3)(C) and section 1.199-6(c), which \npermit such cooperatives to disregard deductions under section 1382(b) and (c) for \nPLR-107084-10\n12\npurposes of computing QPAI and taxable income for purposes of section 199.  Section \n1382(b) provides deductions for per-unit retain allocations paid in money, property and \nqualified per-unit retain certificates as well as for patronage dividends paid in money, \nproperty and qualified written notices of allocation.  It also provides for deductions when \nnonqualified per-unit retain certificates and nonqualified written notices of allocation are\nredeemed.\nTaxpayer does not operate on a pooling basis.  Taxpayer purchases grain from \nmembers and markets the grain.  The amount that each member receives when he or \nshe sells grain to Taxpayer for marketing depends upon where, how, and when the \nmember chooses to sell that grain to Taxpayer.  \nMembers have a number of options for determining how and when sales are \nmade.  As a result, two neighbors delivering the same amount of grain to Taxpayer \nduring any year will be paid different amounts for that grain depending upon where, \nwhen and how they sell the grain to Taxpayer.  However, all members share in \nTaxpayer\u2019s net earnings from marketing operations in proportion to the quantity of \ngrains they market through Taxpayer.  Those net earnings are distributed after the end \nof each year in the form of patronage dividends paid in cash and qualified written \nnotices of allocation (book credits). \nThe question presented in this ruling is whether the grain payments made by \nTaxpayer to patrons for grain qualify as per-unit retain allocations paid in money within \nthe meaning of section 1388(f) of the Code.  \nUnder section 199 of the Code and section 1.199-6 of the regulations, the \nanswer to this question determines who gets to include the grain payments in the \nsection 199 computation.  If the grain payments to members are per-unit retain \nallocations paid in money, then they should be added-back in Taxpayer\u2019s section 199 \ncomputation and not included in the members\u2019 section 199 computations.  If the grain \npayments to members are not per-unit retain allocations paid in money, then they \nshould not be added-back in Taxpayer\u2019s section 199 computation, but should be \nincluded in the members\u2019 section 199 computations.  These results are the same \nwhether Taxpayer decides to keep or to pass-through all or a portion of its section 199 \ndeduction.\nMarketing cooperatives like Taxpayer have never thought of their grain payments \nas per-unit retain allocations paid in money.  However, Taxpayer\u2019s grain payments \nappear to meet the definition of \u201cper-unit retain allocations paid in money\u201d which are \nexcludible or deductible under section 1382(b)(3) of the Code.  The grain payments are \nmade in cash so the \u201cpaid in money\u201d requirement is met.  \nTaxpayer\u2019s grain payments also meet all the requirements of the definition of \n\u201cper-unit retain allocation\u201d contained in section 1388(f) of the Code, which defines the \nPLR-107084-10\n13\nterm \u201cper-unit retain allocation\u201d to mean \u201cany allocation, by an organization to which part \nI of this subchapter applies, to a patron with respect to products marketed for him, the \namount of which is fixed without reference to the net earnings of the organization \npursuant to an agreement between the organization and the patron.\u201d \nFirst, Taxpayer\u2019s grain payments to a member are paid \u201cpursuant to an \nagreement,\u201d namely the particular agreement applicable to the method the member \nuses to determine how and when his or her grain is sold to Taxpayer.  \nSecond, Taxpayer\u2019s grain payments to a member are made \u201cwith respect to \nproducts marketed for him,\u201d namely, the grain delivered by the member for marketing by \nTaxpayer.  As described above, Taxpayer markets the grain it acquires from members, \nand members share in Taxpayer\u2019s net earnings from its marketing activities in the form \nof patronage dividends.  \nThird, the amount of the grain payments to each member \u201cis fixed without \nreference to the net earnings\u201d of Taxpayer since, at the time the payments are made, \nTaxpayer\u2019s actual net earnings for the year are neither known nor determinable.  \nWhile per-unit retains are often made on the basis of a specified amount per unit \nof product marketed, what is important is that they not be made with respect to net \nearnings.  Rev. Rul. 68-236, 1968-2 C.B. 236, provides that \u201cto constitute a per-unit \nretain allocation, the allocation need not be made strictly on the basis of a specified \namount per-unit of product marketed provided it is made with respect to products \nmarketed for the patron and not with respect to the net earnings of the organization.  \nWhether an allocation meets the foregoing description will be a question of fact.\u201d\nThe fact that all members do not receive the same payments for their grain (i.e., \nthat Taxpayer does not pool) does not mean that grain payments should not be treated \nas per-unit retain allocations paid in money.  In Farm Service Cooperative v. \nCommissioner, 619 F. 2d 718 (8th Cir. 1980), the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals \ncharacterized payments to Farm Service\u2019s poultry growers as per-unit retain allocations \npaid in money, even though they were determined under a formula that resulted in \nsome poultry growers receiving more than others depending upon the efficiency of their \noperations and the market price of chickens when they delivered their chickens to Farm \nService.  The Tax Court in Farm Service Cooperative v. Commissioner, 70 T.C. 145, \n147-148 (1978), described the formula as follows:\n\u201cThe grower was paid by petitioner for growing chickens based on the \ndelivery weight to the processing plant, less the weight of chickens \ncondemned by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.  The formula under \nwhich the grower was paid also took into account variable market rates for \nfull grown chickens, and an efficiency factor that related the number of \npounds of feed to the pounds of chickens produced.  The efficiency factor \nPLR-107084-10\n14\nwas figured into the grower's compensation because Farm Service \nsupplied all chicken feed.  Under the contract provisions established with \neach of the growers, there was also a guaranteed minimum amount the \ngrower would receive from the cooperative irrespective of wholesale \nmarket variations.  For example, the contract in effect on July 1, 1968, \nprovided that \u2018In no event will the Grower Member receive less than 1.25 \ncents per pound less U.S.D.A. condemnation.\u2019  On its books, petitioner\ntreated payments to its growers as a cost of production.\u201d\nHistorically, Taxpayer has treated its grain payments as \u201cpurchases,\u201d not as \u201cper-\nunit retain allocations paid in money.\u201d  However, how the payments have been reported \nshould not obscure what they really are.  \nWhether or not Taxpayer is pooling is a moot issue for purpose of this ruling \nbecause its grain payments meet the definition of \u201cper-unit retain allocations paid in \nmoney\u201d in any event.  Nothing in subchapter T of the Code limits the exclusion or \ndeduction for per-unit retain allocations to cooperatives with pools.\nSection 1.199-6(k) of the regulations provides that section 1.199-6 is the \nexclusive method for the cooperative and its patrons to compute the amount of the \nsection 199 deduction.\nThe effect of these sections is that a cooperative such as Taxpayer will compute \nthe entire section 199 deduction at the cooperative level and that none of the \ndistributions whether patronage dividends or per-unit retain allocations received from \nthe cooperative will be eligible for section 199 in the patron\u2019s hands. That is, the patron \nmay not count the qualified payment received from the cooperative in the patron\u2019s own \nsection 199 computation whether or not the cooperative keeps or passes through the \nsection 199 deduction.  Accordingly, the only way that a patron can claim a section 199 \ndeduction for a qualified payment received from a cooperative is for the cooperative to \npass-through the section 199 amount in accordance with the provisions of section \n199(d)(3) of the Code and the regulations thereunder.\nWe note that to prevent a cooperative from deducting the per-unit retain \nallocations made in money or qualified certificates for the second time when the \nassociated grain is sold, the cost of goods sold mechanism associated with inventory \nmust be adjusted to reflect the deductions allowable under subchapter T of the Code.  \nSpecifically, cooperatives need to include the per-unit retain allocations in inventory cost \nfor purposes of making inventory and section 263A of the Code computations and then \nadjust the ending inventory and cost of goods sold to prevent double deduction of the \nper-unit retain allocations.  The adjustments can be made to either the inventory or the \nline item deduction for the per-unit retain allocations.  In other words, if the per-unit \nretain allocations are deducted on a deduction line in the cooperative's tax return, they \nshould be removed entirely from the ending inventory and cost of goods sold computed \nPLR-107084-10\n15\nfor the tax year.  Alternatively, if the per-unit retain allocations are not deducted on a \ndeduction line in the tax return, the per-unit retain allocations reflected in the ending \ninventory should be removed and included in the cost of goods sold amount for that tax \nyear.  This procedure will allow the cooperative to deduct the per-unit retain allocations \nonce while also preserving the integrity of its section 263A calculation.\nFor the reasons described above, Taxpayer\u2019s crop payments to members and \nother participating patrons meet the definition of \u201cper-unit retain allocations paid in \nmoney.\u201d  The per-unit retains must be treated as such for all purposes of the Code and \nare reported in box 3 of Form 1099-PATR, \u201cTaxable Distributions Received From \nCooperatives.\u201d  If properly treated as per-unit retain allocations paid in money, then \nTaxpayer will be entitled to disregard such payments in determining the amount of its \nsection 199 deduction.\nWe note that payments to nonmembers who are not eligible to share in \npatronage dividends (i.e., those with whom Taxpayer does not operate on a cooperative \nbasis with) do not constitute per-unit retains paid in money within the meaning of section \n1382(b)(3) of the Code and, accordingly, are treated exclusively as purchases in the \ncost of goods sold mechanism.\nAccordingly, we rule as requested that:\n1.\nGrain payments to members constitute \u201cper-unit retain allocations paid in money\u201d \nwithin the meaning of section 1382(b)(3) of the Code. \n2.\nFor purposes of computing its section 199 domestic production activities \ndeduction, Taxpayer\u2019s qualified production activities income and taxable income should, \npursuant to section 199(d)(3)(C) of the Code, be computed without regard to any \ndeduction for grain payments to members.\nThe conclusions set forth in this ruling address only purchases that are per-unit \nretain allocations paid in money as they relate to grains marketed by the cooperative \nduring the taxable year and does not apply to purchases of grain that remain in \ninventory at year end.  No opinion is expressed or implied regarding the application of \nany other provision in the Code or regulations.\nThis ruling is directed only to the taxpayer that requested it.  Under section \n6110(k)(3) of the Code it may not be used or cited as precedent.

For purposes of this letter ruling, Government includes Unit. \nFor what are represented to be valid business reasons, Government proposes to\nmove the Insurance Business from public to private ownership after the Privatization\nLegislation has been enacted into law and the Chief Elected Official of Government\ndetermines that certain requirements set forth in the Privatization Legislation have been\nsatisfied.  This move will be accomplished through the following transactions (the\n\u201cFormation Transactions\u201d):\n(i)\nAs of Date B, Unit will transfer assets relating to the Insurance Business\n(the \"Transferred Property\") to Newco, and Newco will assume all of the\nliabilities related to the Transferred Property.  \n(ii)\nNewco will issue all of its Interests directly to the Policyholders.  The\nInterests will entitle holders to vote for a board of directors, to receive\npolicyholder dividends if and when declared, and to share in the assets of\nNewco on liquidation.  The Contracts issued by Unit will by operation of\nlaw become Contracts issued by Newco.\nRepresentations\nThe taxpayer has made the following representations concerning the Formation\nTransactions (based on the characterization of the Formation Transactions set forth in\nruling (1)):\n(a)\nNo stock or securities will be issued for services rendered to or for the\nbenefit of Newco in connection with the Exchange (as defined in ruling (1)\nbelow), and no stock or securities will be issued for indebtedness of\nNewco that is not evidenced by a security or for interest on indebtedness\nof Newco that accrued on or after the beginning of the holding period of \nGovernment for the debt.\n3\nPLR-107248-99\n(b)\nGovernment will not retain any significant power, right, or continuing\ninterests, within the meaning of \u00a7 1253(b) of the Internal Revenue Code,\nin the trademarks or trade names being transferred. \n(c)\nThe Exchange is not the result of the solicitation by a promoter, broker, or\ninvestment house.\n(d)\nGovernment will not retain any rights in the property transferred to Newco\n(other than as a Policyholder).  \n(e)\nThe fair market value of the assets transferred by Government to Newco\nwill equal or exceed the sum of the liabilities assumed by Newco plus any\nliabilities to which the transferred assets are subject.   \n(f)\nThe liabilities of Government to be assumed by Newco were incurred in\nthe ordinary course of business and are associated with the assets to be\ntransferred.\n(g)\nThere will be no indebtedness created in favor of Government as a result\nof the transaction.  There may be indebtedness between Government and\nNewco as a result of dealings in the ordinary course of business.\n(h)\nThe transfers and exchanges will occur under a plan agreed upon before\nthe Exchange in which the rights of the parties are defined.\n(i)\nAll exchanges will occur with an expedition consistent with orderly\nprocedure.\n(j)\nThere is no plan or intention on the part of Newco to redeem or otherwise\nreacquire any stock or indebtedness issued in the proposed transaction.\n(k)\nTaking into account any issuance of additional shares of Newco stock;\nany issuance of stock for services; the exercise of any Newco stock rights,\nwarrants, or subscriptions; a public offering of Newco stock; and the sale,\nexchange, transfer by gift, or other disposition of any of the stock of\nNewco deemed received by Government in the Exchange, Government \nwill be in \"control\" of Newco under \u00a7 368(c) immediately after the\nExchange.\n(l)\nIn the Exchange, Government will constructively receive equity interests in\nNewco approximately equal to the fair market value of the property\ntransferred to Newco.\n(m)\nNewco will remain in existence and retain and use the property transferred\n4\nPLR-107248-99\nto it in a trade or business.\n(n)\nThere is no plan or intention by Newco to dispose of the transferred\nproperty other than in the normal course of business operations.\n(o)\nGovernment and Newco each will pay its own expenses, if any, incurred in\nconnection with the proposed transaction.\n(p)\nNewco will not be an investment company within the meaning of              \n\u00a7 351(e)(1) and \u00a7 1.351-1(c)(1)(ii) of the Income Tax Regulations.\n(q)\nGovernment is not under the jurisdiction of a court in a title 11 or similar\ncase (within the meaning of \u00a7 368(a)(3)(A)), and the stock or securities\nreceived in the Exchange will not be used to satisfy the indebtedness of\nsuch debtor.\n(r)\nNewco will not be a \"personal service corporation\" within the meaning of \n\u00a7 269A.\n(s)\nUnit would be permitted under the Constitution of Government to own all\nof the stock or other equity ownership interests in Newco.\n(t)\nNewco will report its operations on a calendar-year basis using the accrual\nmethod of reporting prescribed by the National Association of Insurance\nCommissioners.\n(u)\nNewco will adopt as the amount of its Date B opening balance of\nundiscounted unpaid losses the amount as of Date C of the undiscounted\nunpaid losses of Government.\nRulings\nBased solely on the information submitted and the representations made, we\nrule as follows:\n(1)\nFor Federal income tax purposes, the Formation Transactions will be\ntreated as if (a) Government had transferred the Transferred Property to\nNewco as of Date C in exchange for all of the Interests in Newco and the\nassumption by Newco of related liabilities (the \"Exchange\") and (b) \nGovernment had transferred the Interests to the Policyholders (see\nD\u2019Angelo Associates, Inc. v. Commissioner, 70 T.C. 121 (1978)). \n(2)\nThe Interests deemed received by Government in the Exchange will be\ntreated as stock under \u00a7 351(a).\n5\nPLR-107248-99\n(3)\nNo gain or loss will be recognized by Government in connection with the\nExchange (\u00a7 351(a)).  The requirement of \u00a7 351(a) that Government\ncontrol Newco immediately after the exchange will be satisfied because\nGovernment has the right, in choosing the method of privatizing the\nInsurance Business, either to retain the Interests or to designate other\npersons to receive the Interests (see D\u2019Angelo Associates, Inc. v.\nCommissioner).\n(4)\nNo income, gain, or loss will be recognized by Newco as a result of the\nExchange (\u00a7 1032(a)).\n(5)\nThe basis of each item of Transferred Property received by Newco in the\nExchange will equal the basis of that item in the hands of Government\nimmediately before the Exchange (\u00a7 362 (a)).\n(6)\nThe holding period of each item of Transferred Property received by\nNewco in the Exchange will include the holding period of that item in the\nhands of Government immediately before the Exchange (\u00a7 1223(2)).\n(7)\nFor the taxable year in which Government enters into the Formation\nTransactions, Newco will include in its reserves at the beginning of that\nyear for purposes of \u00a7 832(b)(5) the ending balances of the reserves\n(determined pursuant to \u00a7 846 on a discounted basis) that Government\nheld immediately before the transaction, in connection with the Contracts\nthat were the subject of the transaction, and Newco will not take into\npremium income for purposes of \u00a7 832(b)(4) any amount with respect to\nthe assets transferred to it in consideration of the assumption of liabilities\nin connection with the transaction (cf. Rev. Rul. 94-45, 1994-2 C.B. 39\n(concerning a life insurance company\u2019s \u00a7 351 transfer of insurance and\nannuity contracts and investment assets to a subsidiary)). \n(8)\nThe realization of the value of any insurance in force transferred in the\nexchange will not be subject to the provisions of \u00a7 832, nor will Newco be\nentitled to deduct as a deferred expense an amount equal to that value (cf.\nRev. Rul. 94-45).\nCaveats\nNo opinion is expressed about the tax treatment of the transactions under other\nprovisions of the Internal Revenue Code and Income Tax Regulations or about the tax\ntreatment of any conditions existing at the time of, or effects resulting from, the\ntransactions that are not specifically covered by the above rulings.  In particular no\nopinion is expressed regarding:\n6\nPLR-107248-99\n(a)  The characterization for tax purposes of the deemed transfer by Government\nto the Policyholders of the Interests in Newco described above in ruling (1)(a) and \n(b)  The tax basis that the Policyholders will have in the Interests following the\ndeemed transfer described above in ruling (1)(a).\nProcedural Statements\nThis ruling is directed only to the taxpayer that requested it.  Section 6110(k)(3)\nprovides that it may not be used or cited as precedent.\nEach taxpayer involved in the transaction should attach a copy of this letter to\nthe taxpayer\u2019s federal income tax return for the taxable year in which the transactions\nare completed.\nIn accordance with the power of attorney on file in this office, a copy of this letter\nis being sent to the taxpayer.\nSincerely,\nAssistant Chief Counsel (Corporate)\n                                                                            By:                                                  \n \n        Wayne T.

During her life, Decedent and \nSpouse transferred their respective 50-percent interests in certain community property \nto a revocable trust, Trust A, which terminated on Decedent=s death.  On termination of \nTrust A, Decedent=s 50-percent interest in the Trust A property passed to Trust B, a \ntrust created by Decedent during her lifetime.  Under Decedent=s will, the residue of her \nestate also passed to Trust B.     \n \nUnder Article 3.1.5 of Trust B, the trust residue is to be distributed to a AMarital \nTrust.@  However, if the trustee elects under section 2056(b)(7) to treat only part of the \nMarital Trust property as qualified terminable interest property, then the property for \nwhich an election is not made will be distributed to Trust C.   \n \nUnder Article 3.2.1, Spouse is to receive, for his life, the net income quarterly and \nas much principal as, in the discretion of the trustee, is necessary for his support and \nmedical care, after taking into consideration, to the extent the trustee may deem \nadvisable, his resources.  On Spouse=s death, certain specific tangible assets will be \ndistributed to designated persons and organizations.  The balance of the Marital Trust \nproperty will be distributed to Charity, an organization exempt from tax under sections \n501(c)(3) and 170(c)(2). \n \nSpouse is designated as trustee of the Marital Trust.  He is also the executor of  \nDecedent=s estate. \n \nIn accordance with the terms of Trust A, the trustee of Trust A will distribute 50- \npercent of the trusts assets, including interests in a limited liability company (LLC), and \ninterests in other limited liability companies and real estate holding partnerships \n(collectively referred to as Business) to Trust B.  The LLC will be liquidated and Trust B \nwill receive marketable securities and certain other assets in a liquidating distribution.  \nThe trustee of Trust B will then distribute assets to the Marital Trust, consisting of \nmarketable securities, tangible personal property, cash and Business. \n \nOn the federal estate tax return filed for decedent\u2019s estate, the executor elected \nto treat the entire Marital Trust as qualified terminable interest property (QTIP) under \nsection 2056(b)(7). \n \n \nSubsequently, on Date 2, Court issued an order pursuant to a petition filed by \nSpouse, as trustee of the Marital Trust.  Pursuant to the court\u2019s order, Marital Trust is to \nbe divided into two trusts, Marital Trust 1 and Marital Trust 2.  Marital Trust 1 and \nMarital Trust 2 are to be administered in accordance with the terms of Marital Trust. \nMarital Trust 1 is to be funded with all tangible personal property, all of Business, and \npossibly some cash and marketable securities.  Marital Trust 2 will be funded only with \npublicly traded securities and cash.  Marital Trust 2 will not be funded with any fractional \ninterest in any asset.   \n \nPLR-141055-03 \n \n3 \n \n           The court order further provides that if Spouse assigns all of his beneficial \ninterest in any Marital Trust created under the terms of Trust B to the remainder \nbeneficiary of that Marital Trust, then upon assignment, the Marital Trust subject to the \nassignment shall terminate and the trust property is to be distributed outright to the \nremainder beneficiary of the trust.  \n \n \nThe court order dividing the Marital Trust is authorized under state law.  State \nStatute.  Further, the court\u2019s determination regarding the termination and distribution of \nthe trust on Spouse\u2019s assignment of his entire interest in the trust to the remainder \nbeneficiary is consistent with applicable state law.  Cite1; Cite2.   \n \n \nIn accordance with the court order, Spouse proposes to assign his entire interest \nin Marital Trust 2 to Charity. \n \nRulings requested \n  \nYou have asked for the following rulings: \n \n(1) For estate tax purposes, the division of the Marital Trust into two trusts \n(Marital Trust 1 and Marital Trust 2 ), funded with specific assets, will not \ninvalidate the QTIP election which was made with respect to the Marital \nTrust. \n \n(2) For estate tax purposes, the court order which authorizes Spouse to \nassign his entire interest in Marital Trust 2 and terminates Marital Trust 2 \nupon the gift by Taxpayer of his interest therein will not invalidate the QTIP \nelection made with respect to the Marital Trust. \n \n(3) For gift tax purposes, Spouse=s gift of his entire interest in Marital Trust \n2 qualifies for the gift tax charitable deduction. \n \n(4) For gift tax purposes, Spouse will be treated under section 2519 as \nmaking a gift of the remainder interest in Marital Trust 2 when he makes a \ngift of his income interest in Marital Trust 2, and Spouse=s gift of the \nremainder interest will qualify for the gift tax charitable deduction. \n \n(5) For gift tax purposes, Spouse=s gift of his income interest in Marital \nTrust 2 does not trigger gift tax treatment of any part of Marital Trust 1. \n \n(6) For income tax purposes, Spouse=s gift of his income interest in Marital \nTrust 2 qualifies for an income tax charitable deduction based on the \nactuarial value of the income interest. \n \n \nPLR-141055-03 \n \n4 \n \nRuling requests 1 through 5 \n \nSection 2056(a) provides that the value of the taxable estate shall, except as \nlimited by section 2056(b), be determined by deducting from the value of the gross  \nestate an amount equal to the value of any interest in property which passes or has \npassed from the decedent to the surviving spouse. \n \nUnder section 2056(b)(1) a marital deduction is not allowed for interests passing \nto the surviving spouse that are Aterminable interests@; that is, interests in property \npassing to the surviving spouse that will terminate or fail on the lapse of time or on the \noccurrence of an event or contingency or on the failure of an event or contingency to \noccur, where on termination, an interest in the property passes to someone other than \nthe surviving spouse. \n \nSection 2056(b)(7) provides an exception to the terminable interest rule in the \ncase of qualified terminable interest property (QTIP).  Under section 2056(b)(7), for \npurposes of section 2056(a), qualified terminable interest property is treated as passing \nto the surviving spouse, and no part of the property is treated as passing to any person \nother than the surviving spouse. \n \nUnder section 2056(b)(7)(B)(i) and (ii), Aqualified terminable interest property@ \nmeans property which passes from the decedent, in which the surviving spouse is \nentitled for life to all the income from the property, payable annually or at more frequent \nintervals, and no person has a power to appoint any part of the property to any person \nother than the surviving spouse. \n \nSection 2501 provides that a tax is imposed on the transfer of property by gift by \nany individual. \n \nSection 2519(a) provides that any disposition of all or part of a qualifying income \ninterest for life in any property to which the section applies is treated as a transfer of all \ninterests in the property other than the qualifying income interest.  Section 2519(b) \nprovides that section 2519 (a) applies to any property if a deduction was allowed with \nrespect to the transfer of such property to the donor under section 2056(b)(7). \n \nSection 25.2519-1(a) of the Gift Tax Regulations provides that a transfer of all or \na portion of the income interest of the spouse in qualified terminable interest property is \na transfer by the spouse under section 2511.    \n \nSection 25.2519-1(c) provides that the amount treated as a transfer under \nsection 2519 upon a disposition of all or part of a qualifying income interest for life in \nqualified terminable interest property is equal to the fair market value of the entire \nproperty subject to the qualifying income interest, determined on the date of the \nPLR-141055-03 \n \n5 \n \ndisposition (including any accumulated income and not reduced by any amount \nexcluded from total gifts under section 2503(b) with respect to the transfer creating the \ninterest), less the value of the qualifying income interest in the property on the date of \nthe disposition.  The gift tax consequences of the disposition of the qualifying income \ninterest are determined separately under ' 25.2511-2.  \n \nSection 2522(a) provides that in computing taxable gifts for the calendar year, \nthere shall be allowed as a deduction the amount of all gifts made during such year to or \nfor the use of charitable organizations described in section 2522(a).  However,  \nunder section 2522(c)(2) and ' 25.2522-3(c)(1) and (2) of the Gift Tax Regulations,  \nwhere a donor transfers an interest property (other than an interest described in section \n170(f)(3)(B)) to a person, or for a use described in section 2522(a) or (b) and an interest \nin the same property is retained by the donor, is transferred, or has been transferred (for \nless than an adequate and full consideration in money or money=s worth) from the donor \nto a person, or for a use, not described in section 2522(a) or (b), no deduction is \nallowed for the interest that is or has been transferred to the person, or for the use, \ndescribed in section 2522(a) or (b), unless the charitable interest is: \n \n(A) an undivided portion (not in trust) of the donor=s entire interest; \n \n(B) a remainder interest (not in trust) in a personal residence or farm; \n \n(D) a remainder interest in a charitable remainder annuity trust or a \ncharitable remainder unitrust (described in section 664) or a pooled \nincome fund (described in section 642(c)(5)); \n \n(E) a guaranteed annuity interest or a unitrust interest; or \n \n(G) a qualified conservation contribution. \n \n \n \nIn Situation 2 of Rev. Rul. 86-60, 1986-1 C. B. 302, the secondary life annuitant \nof a charitable remainder trust transfers the annuitant\u2019s entire annuity interest to the \ncharitable remainder beneficiary.  The ruling concludes that the transfer qualifies for the \ngift tax charitable deduction.  Following the transfer, the secondary life annuitant did not \nretain any interest in the trust.  Further, and at no time had the annuitant made a \ntransfer of an interest in the trust for a private purpose.  Consequently, the transfer to \ncharity need not be in the form described in \u00a7 25.2522(c)-(3)(c)(2).  Accordingly, the \nannuitant\u2019s transfer to charity qualifies for the deduction under section 2522(a).   \n \n \nIn this case, the estate has elected to treat the Marital Trust as qualified \nterminable interest property under section 2056(b)(7).  The division, pursuant to the \ncourt order, of the Marital Trust into Marital Trust 1 and Marital Trust 2, to be funded as \ndescribed above, will not invalidate the election under section 2056(b)(7) with respect to \nPLR-141055-03 \n \n6 \n \nthe Marital Trust, or Marital Trust 1 and Marital Trust 2.  In addition, the court order as it \npertains to the effect of Spouse\u2019s assignment of his entire interest in Marital Trust 2 to \nCharity, will not invalidate the election under section 2056(b)(7) with respect to the \nMarital Trust, or Marital Trust 1 and Marital Trust 2. \n \n \nFurther, when Spouse assigns his entire interest in Marital Trust 2 to Charity, he \nwill make a gift to Charity under section 2511 of his qualifying income interest for life in \nMarital Trust 2.  Charity is an organization described in section 2522(a).  In accordance \nwith Situation 2 of Rev. Rul. 86-60, Spouse\u2019s transfer of his entire interest in Marital \nTrust 2 will qualify for the gift tax charitable deduction under section 2522(a).  \n \n \nIn addition, under section 2519, upon Spouse\u2019s assignment of his interest in \nMarital Trust 2, Spouse will be treated as a making a transfer of all interests in Marital \nTrust 2 other than his qualifying income interest.  Under the court order, which is \nconsistent with applicable state law, upon Spouse\u2019s assignment of his entire interest in \nMarital Trust 2 to Charity, the trust will terminate and the trust corpus will pass outright \nto Charity.  Accordingly, a gift tax charitable deduction under section 2522 will be \nallowed for the amount Spouse is deemed to transfer to Charity under section 2519.  In \naddition, for gift tax purposes, Spouse\u2019s gift of his entire interest in Marital Trust 2, will \nnot otherwise cause Spouse to be treated as making a gift under section 2519 with \nrespect to any portion of Marital Trust 1.  \n \nRuling request 6 \n \nSection 170(a)(1) allows as a deduction any charitable contribution to an \norganization described in section 170(c), payment of which is made within the taxable \nyear. \n \nSection 170(f)(3)(A) disallows a charitable contribution deduction for a \ncontribution of a partial interest in property.  Section 170(f)(3)(B)(ii) provides an \nexception in the case of a contribution of an undivided portion of the taxpayer=s entire \ninterest in the property. \n \nSection 1.170A-7(b)(1)(i) of the Income Tax Regulations defines an undivided \nportion of a taxpayer=s entire interest in property as Aa fraction or percentage of each \nand every substantial interest or right owned by the donor in such property@ that extends \nAover the entire term of the donor=s interest@ in the property.   \n \nSection 1.170-7(a)(2)(i) allows a deduction for a contribution of a partial interest \nin property if the interest is the taxpayer=s entire interest in the property such as an \nincome interest or a remainder interest.  If, however, the property in which the partial \ninterest exists was divided in order to create the partial interest and avoid section \n170(f)(3)(A), the deduction will not be allowed. \n \nPLR-141055-03 \n \n7 \n \nIn Situation 1 of Rev. Rul. 86-60, A, the grantor and life-interest beneficiary of a \ncharitable remainder annuity trust, transfers A=s annuity interest to the charitable \nbeneficiary.  The ruling concludes that the transfer qualifies for a charitable deduction \nunder section 170.  The rationale is that A is contributing A=s entire interest in the \nproperty, and, although A had previously divided the property, the property was not \ndivided in order to avoid the rules of sections 170(f)(2) and (f)(3)(A). \n \nIn the present case, Spouse did not divide the interests in the Marital Trust.   \nInstead, Spouse=s income interest and right to principal, and the charitable beneficiary=s \nremainder interest were created by Decedent.  By contributing his entire interest in \nMarital Trust 2, Spouse will contribute an undivided portion of his entire interest in the \nMarital Trust under section 170(f)(3)(B)(ii).  Spouse represents that in the course of the \nproperty division of the Marital Trust, he will not divide any assets in the Marital Trust \ninto fractional interests.  Thus, section 170(f)(3)(A) does not apply to the contribution of \nSpouse=s interest in Marital Trust 2, and Spouse=s transfer of his entire interest in \nMarital Trust 2 will qualify as a charitable contribution under section 170 limited to the \nfair market value of the interest at the time of the transfer. \n \nExcept as specifically set forth above, no opinion is expressed concerning the \nfederal tax consequences of the facts described above under the cited provisions or any \nother provisions of the Code.    \n \nThis ruling is directed only to the taxpayer requesting it.  Section 6110(k)(3) of \nthe Code provides that it may not be used or cited as precedent. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSincerely yours, \n \n \n                                                       \nGeorge L.

The rulings contained in this letter are based upon information and \nrepresentations submitted by the taxpayer and accompanied by a penalty of perjury \nstatement executed by an appropriate party.  While this office has not verified any of the \nmaterial submitted in support of the request for rulings, it is subject to verification on \nexamination.\nFACTS\nPartnership X is a limited liability company formed under the laws of State and treated \nas a partnership for U.S. federal tax purposes.  Partnership X has s members, t of which \nare U.S. persons (\u201cUS Members\u201d).  The US Members consist of U.S. individuals and a \ndomestic corporation (collectively, \u201cNon-Partnership Members\u201d) that each own less than \n10 percent of Partnership X, and domestic partnerships (\u201cPartnership Members\u201d) that \neach own more than 10 percent of Partnership X.  Taxpayer has represented that \nNotice 2010-41, 2010-22 I.R.B. 715, does not apply to Partnership X\u2019s structure.\nPLR-135547-10\n2\nPartnership X wholly-owns Corporation A, a limited liability company formed under the \nlaws of State that is disregarded as an entity separate from Partnership X for U.S. \nfederal tax purposes.  Corporation A, in turn, wholly-owns Corporation B, an entity \nformed under the laws of Country, which is treated as a corporation for U.S. federal tax \npurposes.\nCorporation B will earn income that is expected to be passive income within the \nmeaning of Internal Revenue Code (\u201cCode\u201d) section 1297(a).  \nCorporation B qualifies as a controlled foreign corporation (\u201cCFC\u201d), as defined under \nCode section 957(a), because Partnership X is a domestic partnership that wholly owns \nCorporation B for U.S. federal tax purposes.  In addition, Corporation B expects to \nqualify as a passive foreign investment company (\u201cPFIC\u201d) (without taking into account \nthe application of Code section 1297(d)), as defined under Code section 1297(a).  \n \nRULING REQUESTED\nCorporation B will not be treated as a PFIC with respect to Partnership X, the Non-\nPartnership Members or any direct or indirect owner of a Partnership Member pursuant \nto Code section 1297(d) during the portion of Partnership X\u2019s holding period that \nPartnership X is a U.S. Shareholder (within the meaning of Code section 951(b)) with \nrespect to Corporation B and Corporation B is a CFC.\nLAW\nCode section 957 defines a CFC as a foreign corporation with regard to which more \nthan 50 percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote \nor the total value of the stock of the corporation is owned (directly, indirectly, or \nconstructively) by U.S. shareholders.  \nCode section 951(b) defines a U.S. shareholder for CFC purposes as a U.S. person \nwho owns (directly, indirectly, or constructively) 10 percent or more of the total \ncombined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote of the foreign corporation.  \n(\u201cU.S. Shareholder\u201d).\nCode section 7701(a)(30) defines a U.S. person as a U.S. citizen or resident, a \ndomestic partnership, a domestic corporation and any domestic estate or trust.\n \nCode section 702(a) provides generally that each partner in a partnership takes into \naccount a distributive share of the partnership\u2019s income or gain in determining the \npartner\u2019s income tax.  \nCode section 702(b) provides that the character of an item of income or gain included in \na partner\u2019s distributive share is determined as if such item were realized directly from \nPLR-135547-10\n3\nthe source from which realized by the partnership, or incurred in the same manner as \nincurred by the partnership.  \nCode section 1297(a) defines a PFIC as any foreign corporation if either: (1) at least 75 \npercent of the corporation\u2019s income for the taxable year is passive income; or (2) the \naverage percentage of assets held by the corporation during the taxable year that \nproduce, or are held for the production of, passive income is at least 50 percent.\nCode section 1297(b) defines passive income for purposes of the PFIC income test as \nincome which is of a kind which would be foreign personal holding company income as \ndefined in Code section 954(c), subject to certain exceptions.\nCode section 1298(b)(1) provides that a foreign corporation is treated as a PFIC with \nrespect to a U.S. shareholder, and the U.S. shareholder is subject to the excess \ndistribution regime, if the foreign corporation qualified as a PFIC, but not a Qualified \nElecting Fund, at any point during the U.S. shareholder\u2019s holding period.\nCode section 1297(d)(1) provides that a corporation shall not be treated with respect to \na shareholder as a PFIC during the qualified portion of such shareholder\u2019s holding \nperiod with respect to the stock in such corporation.  (\u201cOverlap Rule\u201d).\nCode section 1297(d)(2) defines \u201cqualified portion\u201d to mean the portion of a \nshareholder\u2019s holding period which is after December 31, 1997 and during which the \nshareholder is a U.S. Shareholder of the corporation and the corporation is a CFC.\nThe legislative history to Code section 1297(d) provides that the Overlap Rule was \nenacted because of a concern about the unnecessary complexity caused by the \napplication of the subpart F and PFIC regimes to the same shareholders.  To address \nthis concern, the legislative history to Code section 1297(d) states that \u201ca shareholder \nthat is subject to current inclusion under the subpart F rules with respect to stock of a \nPFIC that is also a CFC generally is not subject also to the PFIC provisions with respect \nto the same stock.\u201d  \nANALYSIS\nIt is expected that Corporation B will qualify as a PFIC as defined under Code section \n1297(a).  Partnership X, a domestic partnership, is a U.S. person within the meaning of \nCode section 7701(a)(30).  Partnership X is the sole owner of Corporation B for U.S. \nfederal tax purposes and thus is a U.S. Shareholder with respect to Corporation B.  \nAccordingly, Partnership X will be subject to the subpart F rules with respect to \nCorporation B, and will not be subject to the PFIC regime with respect to Corporation B \npursuant to the Overlap Rule.  The Non-Partnership Members will take into account \ntheir distributive shares of Partnership X\u2019s income, including any section 951 inclusion \nwith respect to Corporation B.  The partners in the Partnership Members will take into \nPLR-135547-10\n4\naccount their distributive share of their respective Partnership Member\u2019s distributive \nshare of Partnership X\u2019s income, including any section 951 inclusion with respect to \nCorporation B.\nRULING\nBased on the information submitted and the representations made, we rule as follows:\nCorporation B will not be treated as a PFIC with respect to Partnership X, the Non-\nPartnership Members or the direct or indirect owners of the Partnership Members \npursuant to Code section 1297(d) during the qualified portion (within the meaning of \nCode section 1297(d)) of Partnership X\u2019s holding period that Partnership X is a U.S. \nShareholder of Corporation B and Corporation B is a CFC.  Taxpayer has represented \nthat Notice 2010-41 does not apply to Partnership X\u2019s structure.  In the event a U.S. \nperson does beneficially own an interest in Partnership X directly or indirectly through a \nCFC as described in Notice 2010-41, this ruling does not apply to such U.S. person.  \nExcept as expressly provided herein, no opinion is expressed or implied concerning the \ntax consequences of any aspect of any transaction or item discussed or referenced in \nthis letter ruling.\nThis letter ruling is directed only to the taxpayer who requested it.  Section 6110(k)(3) of \nthe Code provides that it may not be used or cited as precedent.\nA copy of this letter ruling must be attached to any federal income tax return to which it \nis relevant.  Alternatively, taxpayers filing their returns electronically may satisfy this \nrequirement by attaching a statement to their return that provides the date and control \nnumber of the letter ruling.\nIn accordance with the Power of Attorney on file with this office, a copy of this letter is \nbeing sent to your authorized representative.\nSincerely,\nJeffery Mitchell\nBranch Chief, Branch 2\nAssociate Chief Counsel (International)\ncc:\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Non-Adverse"}]}

\nState X  \n \n \n=  \n-------------- \nDear -------------------- \nThis letter responds to your letter dated February 27, 2005, requesting rulings as \nto the federal income tax consequences of a proposed transaction.  Additional \ninformation was submitted in letters dated June 2, June 13, and June 22, 2005.  The \ninformation submitted is summarized below. \nThe rulings contained in this letter are based on facts and representations \nsubmitted by the taxpayer and accompanied by a penalty of perjury statement executed \nby an appropriate party.  This office has not verified any of the materials submitted in \nsupport of the request for rulings.  Verification of the information, representations, and \nother data may be required as part of the audit process.  Moreover, no information \nprovided by the taxpayer has been reviewed and no determination has been made \nregarding whether the proposed transaction: (i) satisfies the business purpose \nrequirement of section 1.355-2(b) of the Income Tax Regulations; (ii) is used principally \nas a device for the distribution of the earnings and profits of the distributing corporation \nor the controlled corporation or both (see section 355(a)(1)(B) of the Internal Revenue \nCode and Treas. Reg. section 1.355-2(d); and (iii) is part of a plan (or series of related \ntransactions) pursuant to which one or more persons will acquire directly or indirectly \nstock representing a 50-percent or greater interest in the distributing corporation or the \ncontrolled corporation (see section 355(e)(2)(A)(ii) and Treas. Reg. section 1.355-7).  \nDistributing is a publicly traded holding company with a single class of voting \ncommon stock outstanding.  Distributing is the common parent of an affiliated group of \ncorporations that files a consolidated federal income tax return (the \u201cDistributing \nGroup\u201d).  Shareholders A and B each own more than five percent of the Distributing \nstock, but neither shareholder has a representative on Distributing\u2019s board of directors \nor participates actively in the management of Distributing. \nDistributing owns all of the outstanding stock of Controlled, Sub A, Sub B, and \nSub C.  Controlled owns all of the outstanding stock of Sub E.  Sub C owns all the \noutstanding stock of Sub D.  Distributing, Controlled, Sub A, Sub B, Sub D, and Sub E \nalso own the stock of various other subsidiaries.  Controlled has a single class of voting \ncommon stock outstanding. \n5 \nPLR-111376-05 \n \nDistributing conducts Business A, Business B, Business C, and Business D \nthrough its wholly owned subsidiaries.  Sub A directly engages in Business A.  Sub B \ndirectly engages in Business B.  Sub C conducts Business C through Sub D, which \ndirectly engages in Business C.  Controlled directly engages in Business D.  Sub E also \ndirectly engages in Business D. \nThe taxpayer has submitted financial information which indicates that each of \nBusiness A, Business B, Business C, and Business D, as conducted by Distributing and \nits relevant subsidiaries, including Controlled, has had gross receipts and operating \nexpenses representing the active conduct of a trade or business for each of the past \nfive years.   \nDistributing has proposed separating Business D from Business A and the other \nbusinesses conducted by the Distributing Group in order to address certain \u201cfit and \nfocus\u201d problems that currently impede the optimal development and performance of \nboth Business A and Business D.  In particular, the distribution is being undertaken to \nresolve systemic issues related to the allocation of capital and management resources \nbetween Business A and Business D.  Distributing believes that, as a result of the \ndistribution, Controlled, together with its subsidiaries (the \u201cControlled Group\u201d), will have \ngreater flexibility to manage, invest in, and expand its businesses, including Business D, \nwhile Distributing, together with its remaining subsidiaries (the \u201cResidual Distributing \nGroup\u201d and, together with the \u201cControlled Group,\u201d the \u201cGroups\u201d) will be better able to \nfocus its time and resources on the development of its businesses, including Business \nA.   \nTo accomplish this goal, the following transactions have been proposed:  \n(i) \nDistributing will contribute approximately $a of cash to Controlled. \n(ii) \nSub E will convert to a State X limited liability company that \ndoes not elect to be treated as an entity separate from \nControlled for U.S. tax purposes. \n(iii) \nControlled will transfer its portion of Business D to Sub E \nLLC. \n(iv) \nDistributing will distribute all of the Controlled common stock \npro rata to the shareholders of Distributing common stock, \nother than shareholders of unvested Distributing restricted \nstock.  Distributing shareholders of record will receive cash \nin lieu of fractional shares, if any (the \u201cDistribution\u201d). \n(v) \nHolders of unvested Distributing restricted stock who are \nemployees of the Residual Distributing Group will receive \nadditional unvested Distributing restricted stock, and holders \n6 \nPLR-111376-05 \n \nof unvested Distributing restricted stock who are employees \nof the Controlled Group will generally have their unvested \nDistributing restricted stock converted to a greater amount of \nnew unvested Controlled restricted stock. \nIn connection with the Distribution, the Groups will enter into a number of \nagreements, including an F Agreement, a G Agreement, one or more H Agreements, an \nI Agreement, a J Agreement, a K Agreement, and various L Agreements (collectively, \nthe \u201cAgreements\u201d).  The Agreements will govern the terms of the Distribution and \nvarious indemnities and continuing relationships between the Groups after the \nDistribution.  Under the Agreements and otherwise, the Groups will maintain the \nContinuing Relationships, which consist of twelve principal categories of continuing \nrelationships after the Distribution. \nIn connection with the I Agreement, certain intellectual property rights will be \nassigned or licensed, generally on a royalty-free basis by the Residual Distributing \nGroup to the Controlled Group and vice versa prior to the Distribution.  The K \nAgreement will allocate liabilities and obligations and, in certain instances, assets, \nrelating to employee compensation and benefits plans and programs in connection with \nthe Distribution, including with respect to various Residual Distributing Group and \nControlled Group\u2019s retirement, welfare, incentive compensation, and employee benefits \nplans.  In addition, the Controlled Group may assume existing deferred compensation \nliabilities relating to certain current employees of the Residual Distributing Group who \nwill become employees of the Controlled Group in connection with the Distribution, and \nvice versa.  Such assumptions may be offset by corresponding transfers of cash. (The \ntransactions described in this paragraph are hereinafter collectively referred to as the \n\u201cMiscellaneous Transactions.\u201d) \nExcept with respect to certain Continuing Relationships, each of the Continuing \nRelationships will have a limited initially agreed duration of no more than c months \nfollowing the Distribution.  Certain Continuing Relationships will be subject to automatic \nrenewal unless either party elects in its sole discretion not to renew.  All of the \nContinuing Relationships are designed to facilitate, rather than impede, the separation \nof Business A and Business D. \nThe following representations have been made regarding the Distribution and the \nrelated transactions: \n(a) \nExcept for (i) contingent liabilities and accounts payable arising from the \nAgreements and other agreements entered into in the ordinary course of \nbusiness; (ii) up to b of intercompany debt currently owed by the Controlled \nGroup to the Residual Distributing Group that will be repaid within d days of the \nDistribution; and (iii) up to b of backup new intercompany debt under a backup \nbridge financing facility that the Controlled Group may enter into with the \n7 \nPLR-111376-05 \n \nResidual Distributing Group as lender solely to facilitate an offering of debt \nsecurities by the Controlled Group to third party investors and/or the \nestablishment of other appropriate third party funding, no intercorporate debt will \nbe outstanding between Distributing and Controlled at the time of, or subsequent \nto, the Distribution.  In this regard, the backup bridge financing facility described \nin (iii) would be utilized by the Controlled Group only in the event that the \nControlled Group were unable, after making diligent efforts, to borrow an \nequivalent amount on reasonably acceptable market terms from third party \nlenders and no debt would be outstanding under such facility at the same time as \nany debt described in (ii).  Any indebtedness owed by Controlled to Distributing \nafter the Distribution will not constitute stock or securities. \n(b) \nNo part of the consideration to be distributed by Distributing will be received by a \nDistributing shareholder as a creditor, employee, or in any capacity other than \nthat of a shareholder of Distributing, except for shares of Distributing and \nControlled restricted stock received by shareholders of Distributing restricted \nstock. \n(c) \nImmediately after the Distribution, at least 90 percent of the fair market value of \nthe gross assets of Distributing will consist of the stock and securities of \ncontrolled corporations, Sub A, Sub B, and Sub C.  Sub A and Sub B are each \ndirectly engaged in the active conduct of a trade or businesses as defined in \nsection 355(b)(2).  Immediately after the Distribution, at least 90 percent of the \nfair market value of the gross assets of Sub C will consist of the stock and \nsecurities of Sub D, a controlled corporation that is directly engaged in the active \nconduct of a trade or business as defined in section 355(b)(2).  \n(d) \nThe 5 years of financial information submitted on behalf of Controlled, Sub A, \nSub D, and Sub E are representative of each corporation\u2019s present operations \nand, with regard to each such corporation, there have been no substantial \noperational changes since the date of the last financial statements submitted. \n(e) \nFollowing the Distribution, Distributing (indirectly through Sub A, Sub B, and Sub \nD) and Controlled (directly) will each continue the active conduct of its business, \nindependently and with its separate employees.  \n(f) \nThe Distribution will be carried out for the following corporate business purpose: \nto enhance fit and focus.  The Distribution is motivated, in whole or substantial \npart, by such corporate business purpose. \n(g) \nThe Distribution will not be used principally as a device for the distribution of the \nearnings and profits of Distributing or Controlled or both. \n8 \nPLR-111376-05 \n \n(h) \nThe total adjusted basis and the fair market value of the assets transferred to \n \nControlled by Distributing each equals or exceeds the sum of the liabilities \n \nassumed (within the meaning of section 357(d)) by Controlled and the \n \nliabilities assumed (within the meaning of section 357(d)) by Controlled in the \n \ntransaction were incurred in the ordinary course of business. \n(i) \nDistributing neither accumulated its receivables nor made extraordinary payment \nof its payables in anticipation of the Distribution. \n(j) \nImmediately before the Distribution, items of income, gain, loss, deduction, and \ncredit will be taken into account as required by the applicable intercompany \ntransaction regulations (see Treas. Reg. sections 1.1502-13 and 1.1502-14 as in \neffect before the publication of T.D. 8597, 1995-32 I.R.B. 6, and as currently in \neffect; Treas. Reg. section 1.1502-13, as published by T.D. 8597).  Furthermore, \nDistributing\u2019s excess loss account, if any, with respect to Controlled, and any \nexcess loss account in any direct or indirect subsidiary of Controlled, will be \nincluded in income immediately before the Distribution.  (See Treas. Reg. section \n1.1502-19.) \n(k) \nPayments made in connection with all continuing transactions between \nDistributing and Controlled will be for fair market value based on terms and \nconditions arrived at by the parties bargaining at arm\u2019s length (either with respect \nto an individual continuing transaction, or considering two or more continuing \ntransactions in the aggregate).   \n(l) \nNeither Distributing nor Controlled is an investment company as defined in \nsection 368(a)(2)(F)(iii) and (iv). \n(m) \nAny payment of cash in lieu of fractional shares of Controlled stock in the \nDistribution will be solely for the purpose of avoiding the expense and \ninconvenience to Controlled of issuing fractional shares and will not represent \nseparately bargained for consideration.  The total of any cash paid in the \nDistribution to shareholders of record in lieu of fractional shares of Controlled \nstock will not exceed one percent of the total consideration that will be distributed \nin the Distribution.  The fractional share interests, if any, of each Distributing \nshareholder of record will be aggregated, and no Distributing shareholder of \nrecord will receive cash in lieu of fractional shares in an amount equal to or \ngreater than the value of one full share of Controlled stock. \n(n) \nThe Distribution is not part of a plan or series of related transactions (within the \nmeaning of Treas. Reg. section 1.355-7) pursuant to which one or more persons \nwill acquire directly or indirectly stock representing a 50 percent or greater \ninterest (within the meaning of section 355(d)(4)) in Distributing or Controlled \n(including any predecessor or successor of any such corporation). \n9 \nPLR-111376-05 \n \nBased solely on the information submitted and the representations set forth \nabove, we rule as follows: \n(1) \nThe contribution of cash and other assets, if any, by Distributing to Controlled \nand the assumption by Controlled of Distributing\u2019s liabilities in connection with the \nDistribution, followed by the distribution of the Controlled common stock, will, \ncollectively, qualify as a \u201creorganization\u201d within the meaning of section \n368(a)(1)(D), and Distributing and Controlled will each be a \u201cparty to a \nreorganization\u201d within the meaning of section 368(b). \n(2) \nNo gain or loss will be recognized by Distributing with respect to the contributions \nand assumptions described in ruling (1) (sections 357 and 361(a)). \n(3) \nNo gain or loss will be recognized by Controlled with respect to the  \n \ncontributions described in ruling (1) (section 1032(a)).  \n(4) \nControlled\u2019s basis in each applicable asset contributed by Distributing to \nControlled, as described in ruling (1), will equal the basis of that asset in the \nhands of Distributing immediately before the contribution (section 362(b)). \n(5) \nControlled\u2019s holding period for each applicable asset contributed by Distributing \nto Controlled, as described in ruling (1), will include the period during which \nDistributing held that asset (section 1223(2)). \n(6) \nNo gain or loss will be recognized by Distributing with respect to the distribution \nof the Controlled common stock to shareholders of Distributing common stock  \n(sections 355(c) and 361(c)(1)).  \n(7) \nNo gain or loss will be recognized by (and no amount will otherwise be included \nin the income of) the shareholders of Distributing common stock on the receipt of \nthe Controlled common stock in the Distribution (section 355(a)(1)).  Section \n355(a)(3)(B) will not treat as \u201cother property\u201d any part of the Controlled common \nstock constructively issued by Controlled to Distributing in exchange for any \nintellectual property rights transferred to Controlled pursuant to the I Agreement. \n(8) \nThe aggregate basis of the Distributing common stock and the Controlled \ncommon stock (including any fractional interest in the Controlled common stock) \nin the hands of shareholders of Distributing common stock immediately after the \nDistribution will be the same as the aggregate basis of the Distributing common \nstock held by such shareholders immediately before the Distribution, allocated in \nproportion to the fair market value of each in accordance with Treas. Reg. \nsection 1.358-2(a)(2) (section 358(a)(1), (b), and (c)). \n(9) \nThe holding period of the Controlled common stock received by each share- \nholder of the Distributing common stock in the Distribution will include the holding \n10 \nPLR-111376-05 \n \nperiod of the Distributing common stock with respect to which the Distribution \nwas made, provided that the Distributing common stock was held as a capital \nasset on the date of the Distribution (section 1223(1)).  \n(10) \nEarnings and profits will be allocated between Distributing and Controlled in \n \naccordance with section 312(h), Treas. Reg. section 1.312-10(a), and Treas. \n \nReg. section 1.1502-33(e)(3). \n \n(11) \nPayments made between any of Distributing and Controlled or their subsidiaries \n \nand successors under tax sharing agreements, if any, between them with respect \n \nto tax  liabilities that (i) have arisen or will arise for taxable periods ending before \n \nthe proposed transaction, and (ii) will not become fixed and ascertainable until \n \nafter the proposed transaction will be treated as occurring immediately before the \n \nDistribution.  \n \n(12) \nA shareholder who receives cash in lieu of fractional shares of Controlled stock \n \nwill recognize gain or loss measured by the difference between the basis of the \n \nfractional share received, as determined above in ruling (8), and the amount of \n \ncash received (section 1001). If the fractional share interest qualifies as a capital \n \nasset in the hands of the shareholder, the gain or loss will be a capital gain or \n \nloss subject to the provisions of Subchapter P of Chapter 1 of the Code. \nNo opinion is expressed about the tax treatment of the proposed transaction \nunder other provisions of the Code or regulations or the tax treatment of any conditions \nexisting at the time of, or effects resulting from, the proposed transaction that are not \nspecifically covered by the above rulings.  In particular, no opinion is expressed \nregarding: (i) whether the Distribution satisfies the business purpose requirement of \nsection 1.355-2(b); (ii) whether the proposed transaction is used principally as a device \nfor the distribution of the earnings and profits of the distributing corporation or the \ncontrolled corporation or both (see section 355(a)(1)(B) and Treas. Reg. section 1.355-\n2(d)); and (iii) whether the Distribution and an acquisition or acquisitions are part of a \nplan (or series of related transactions) under section 355(e)(2)(A)(ii).  We also express \nno opinion regarding (i) any tax effects of Treas. Reg. section 1.1502-13(g), (ii) whether \nthe transfer of any intellectual property rights pursuant to the I Agreement constitutes a \ntransfer of property (see Rev. Rul. 69-156, 1969-1 C.B. 101) or (iii) any other tax effects \nof the Miscellaneous Transactions. \nThis ruling is directed only to the taxpayer requesting it.

This Office has not verified any of the materials \nPLR-118512-09\n2\nsubmitted in support of the request for rulings.  Verification of the information, \nrepresentations, and other data may be required as part of the audit process.\nSUMMARY OF FACTS\nTaxpayer is an accrual basis State X corporation that files its federal income tax returns \nas a real estate investment trust (\u201cREIT\u201d) on a calendar year basis.  Taxpayer \nrepresents that it qualifies as a REIT under the Code, that it intends to maintain such \nqualification as a REIT, and that it regularly distributes its earning and profits as \nrequired under section 857(a)(1).\nTaxpayer has one class of common stock outstanding (the \u201cCommon Stock\u201d), which is \npublicly traded and listed on the Exchange.  All references below to \u201cStockholder\u201d refer \nto holders of Common Stock.\nSubject to the approval of its Board of Directors, Taxpayer intends to make a special \ndividend (each a \u201cSpecial Dividend\u201d and collectively, the \u201cSpecial Dividends\u201d) on its \nCommon Stock for the quarters ending Date 1, Date 2, Date 3, and Date 4 of each of \nYear A and Year B, as described below.  Taxpayer intends to limit the cash portion of \neach Special Dividend to approximately 20 percent of each Special Dividend; in no \nevent will the total amount of cash available to be distributed be less than 20 percent of \neach Special Dividend.\nEach holder of Common Stock will have the right to elect to receive cash or Common \nStock of equivalent value, as follows:\n\u2022\nCash Alternative \u2014 100 percent cash (subject to adjustment as described \nbelow); or\n\u2022\nStock Alternative \u2014 100 percent Common Stock.\nTaxpayer expects to declare the Special Dividends using the following election \nmechanism.\nTaxpayer will provide to each Stockholder an election form for each Special Dividend \nshortly after the record date.  Each Stockholder may elect to receive its dividend by \nindicating the Cash Alternative or the Stock Alternative by the election deadline.  If a \nStockholder fails to make a valid election by the election deadline, that Stockholder will \nbe deemed to have made an election to be determined by Taxpayer at Taxpayer's sole \ndiscretion.  Stock distributed pursuant to each Special Dividend will be subject to the \nownership limitations in Taxpayer's charter (the \u201cOwnership Limitation\u201d).  Taxpayer is \nnot aware of any currently existing Stockholder who upon receipt of the Special \nDividends will be affected by the Ownership Limitation.\nWhile each Stockholder will have the option to elect to receive cash in lieu of Common \nStock for the Stockholder's full entitlement under each Special Dividend, Taxpayer \nPLR-118512-09\n3\nintends to limit the total cash to be distributed pursuant to each Special Dividend to an \namount equal to approximately 20 percent of such Special Dividend (such amount to be \nreferred to as, the \u201cCash Limit\u201d).  In no event will the total amount of cash available to \nbe distributed be less than the Cash Limit.  To the extent necessary, Taxpayer will issue \ncash in lieu of fractional shares of Common Stock.  Any cash issued in lieu of fractional \nshares of Common Stock will not count towards the Cash Limit.\nIf the total number of shares of Common Stock with respect to which the Cash \nAlternative is made (\u201cCash Election Shares\u201d) would result in the payment of cash in an \naggregate amount that is less than or equal to the Cash Limit, then (i) the Stockholders \nwho elect the Cash Alternative will receive such Special Dividend entirely in cash, and \n(ii) the Stockholders who elect the Stock Alternative will receive such Special Dividend \nentirely in Common Stock.\nIf the total number of Cash Election Shares would result in the payment of cash in an \naggregate amount that exceeds the Cash Limit, then (i) the Stockholders who elect the \nStock Alternative will receive such Special Dividend entirely in Common Stock, and (ii) \nthe Stockholders who elect the Cash Alternative will receive a pro rata portion of the \navailable cash pursuant to the Cash Limit with the remainder of such Special Dividend \nbeing received in shares of Common Stock.  Based on this formula, in no case will Cash \nElection Shares receive less than 20 percent of such Special Dividend in cash.\nRULINGS\nBased solely on the information provided and the representations made, we rule as \nfollows with respect to the Special Dividends. Any and all of the cash and stock \ndistributed by Taxpayer as part of the Special Dividends (as described above) shall be \ntreated as distributions of property with respect to its stock to which section 301 applies.  \nSections 301; 305(b)(1) and/or 305(b)(2).  The amount of the distributions of the stock \nreceived by any Stockholder electing to receive stock will be considered to equal the \namount of the money which could have been received instead.  \u00a7 1.305-1(b)(2).\nCAVEATS\nExcept as expressly provided herein, no opinion is expressed or implied concerning the \ntax consequences of any aspect of any transaction or item discussed or referenced in \nthis letter.  In particular, no opinion is expressed with regard to whether Taxpayer \nqualifies as a REIT under subchapter M of the Code.  Furthermore, no opinion is \nexpressed with regard to whether the Special Dividend constitutes a Preferential \nDividend under section 562(c) of the Code.\nPROCEDURAL STATEMENTS\nThis ruling is directed only to the taxpayer requesting it. Section 6110(k)(3) of the Code \nPLR-118512-09\n4\nprovides that it may not be used or cited as precedent.  A copy of this letter must be \nattached to any income tax return to which it is relevant.  Alternatively, taxpayers filing \ntheir returns electronically may satisfy this requirement by attaching a statement to their \nreturn that provides the date and control number of the letter ruling.\nPursuant to the power of attorney on file in this office, a copy of this ruling letter will be \nsent to your authorized representative.\nSincerely,\nSteven J.

Company offers members,\nsuch as you, incentives for purchasing products and services at merchants\u2019 retail\nstores, direct from suppliers and on-line using Company\u2019s website.\nCompany administers the member program primarily through its website.  Members,\nsuch as you, who agree to the terms and conditions contained in the membership\nagreement, may earn m in two ways.  Members may earn m based on the amount of\nthe members\u2019 products and services purchased from participating merchants. \nSecondly, members may earn m as additional bonus incentives for participation in such\nactivities as enrolling in the member program.  Members accumulate m, which may be\n2\nPLR-139124-01\nredeemed by members for merchandise or cash from the participating merchants. \nAnother option available to the member is to elect to donate m to an entity described in\n\u00a7170(c), which may redeem m.  Members may make this election on the website by\nclicking on the \u201cdonate\u201d button and designating how many points they wish to donate.  \nCompany administers the merchant component of its program by soliciting merchants\nto join the m plan and then entering into a plan agreement with them.  Pursuant to the\nplan agreement, Company is obligated to perform certain functions, including the\nprovision of all materials necessary to facilitate the execution of transactions\nelectronically crediting members\u2019 accounts with m.  Company retains title to equipment,\nforms, redemption materials, and other items related to the system through which m are\nawarded, and Company licenses the necessary items to the merchant for stated fees. \nIn addition, the merchants agree to fund the purchase of m awarded to members,\nbased on the amount of the products and services purchased by members (\u201crebate m\u201d). \nCompany retains initial title to rebate m.  At the time rebate m are issued, title passes\nfrom Company to the merchant and then to the member, such as you, to whom they are\nawarded. \nEach member, including you, is able to track the receipt and disbursement of m through\na separate account on Company\u2019s website, accessible through a login and password. \nFor contributions to Charity, the account lists the designated recipient and the amount\nof m contributed.  In addition, each member is able to track the amount of his or her\nrebate m and m awarded as bonus incentives, which are separately accounted for on\nthe website.  \nYou itemize your federal income tax deductions.  You plan to donate a certain portion of\nthe rebate m that you have earned to a charity described in \u00a7170(c) (\u201cCharity\u201d). \nCompany, acting as your agent, will make such donations directly to Charity.  Company\nwill provide Charity with your name and address for purposes of complying with the\n\u00a7170(f)(8) acknowledgment rules.  The recipient Charity will provide any required\nacknowledgment under \u00a7170(f)(8).\nLAW AND ANALYSIS\nRuling Request #1:\nSection 61 of the Code provides that gross income means income from whatever\nsource derived.\n3\nPLR-139124-01\nSection 1012 provides that the basis of property shall be the cost of such property,\nexcept as otherwise provided.\nSection 1016 provides that proper adjustment in respect of the basis of property shall\nbe made for expenditures, receipts losses, or other items properly chargeable to capital\naccount.\nRev. Rul. 84-41, 1984-1 C.B. 130, holds that a manufacturer\u2019s rebate received by an\nautomobile dealer represents a trade discount and must be treated by the dealer as a\nreduction in the cost of the automobile and not as gross income.  Likewise, Rev. Rul.\n76-96, 1976-1 C.B. 23, holds that amounts paid by an automobile manufacturer to retail\ncustomers who purchase new automobiles are not includible in the gross income of the\ncustomers; the amounts are rebates and represent a reduction in the purchase price of\nthe automobiles.   \nIn the present situation, you have represented that a member may receive m in\nconnection with products or services purchased from the participating merchants.  You\nhave also represented that at the time rebate m are issued to a member, title passes\nfrom Company, to the merchant, and then to the member to whom the m are awarded. \nAs in the revenue rulings described above, the amount of the rebate is based on solely\non the amount of purchases.  Thus, rebate m qualify as rebates, which you exclude\nfrom gross income under \u00a761.  Under \u00a71016, the value of rebate m reduces the basis\nof merchandise purchased.  \nRuling Request #2:\nSection 170(a)(1) provides, subject to certain limitations, a deduction for charitable\ncontributions described in \u00a7170(c), payment of which is made within the taxable year. \nSection 170(c)(2) states, in part, that the term \u201ccharitable contribution\u201d means a\ncontribution or gift to or for the use of a qualified organization.\nSection 170(f)(8)(A) provides that no deduction is allowed under \u00a7170 for a contribution\nof $250 or more unless the taxpayer substantiates the contribution with a\ncontemporaneous written acknowledgment of the contribution from a charitable\norganization.  Section 170(f)(8)(B) sets forth the information that must be included in\nthe contemporaneous written acknowledgment.\nSection 1.170A-1(b) of the Income Tax Regulations provides that a charitable\ncontribution is ordinarily made at the time the delivery is effected.\nA charitable contribution must be made voluntarily and with donative intent.  United\nStates v. American Bar Endowment, 477 U.S. 105 (1986).  In American Bar\nEndowment, a membership organization maintained a group insurance program for its\nmembers.  Every year, excess insurance premiums paid by members were refunded to\n4\nPLR-139124-01\nthe organization.  This excess was called a \u201cdividend.\u201d  As a condition of participating in\nthe insurance program, members were required to assign their rights to a pro rata\nportion of the dividends to the organization.  The organization used the dividends to\nfund charitable grants.  Members participating in the group insurance program claimed\ncharitable deductions under \u00a7170 for their pro rata shares of the dividends.  The\nSupreme Court disallowed these deductions, concluding that the assignments were not\nvoluntary.  The Court suggested that it would have reached a different result were the\nABE to give each member a choice between retaining his pro rata share of dividends or\nassigning them to charity.\nIn the present case, you may choose to donate m to Charity.  This opportunity to\ndonate is described in the membership agreement that was provided to you when you\njoined the program administered by Company.  You make this election by clicking on\nthe \u201cdonate\u201d button on the website, and designating how many points you wish to\ndonate.  This element of choice distinguishes Company\u2019s program from the group\ninsurance program in American Bar Endowment, where participants could not choose\nto retain the dividends assigned them.  The opportunity to decide whether payments will\nbe made to Charity renders the payments voluntary.\nIn the present case, Company is authorized to act on your behalf.  Thus, there is no\ndelivery of a charitable contribution when Company receives m as designated by you. \nRather, delivery to Charity occurs when Company transfers m to Charity.  Therefore,\nyou will be entitled to treat as charitable contributions the m paid within the taxable year\nto Charity on your behalf.\nSection 170(f)(8)(A) provides that no deduction is allowed for a charitable contribution\nof $250 or more unless the taxpayer substantiates the contribution by a\ncontemporaneous written acknowledgment of the contribution.  The requirements for\nthe contemporaneous written acknowledgment are set forth in \u00a7170(f)(8)(B).  Under\n\u00a7170(f)(8), if Company makes a lump-sum transfer to a charity of $250 or more on your\nbehalf, you must substantiate the contribution with a contemporaneous written\nacknowledgment that meets the requirements of \u00a7170(f)(8)(B).  You have represented\nthat for amounts contributed in excess of $250, Company will provide Charity with your\nname and address.  With this information, Charity will be able to provide the\nsubstantiation required by \u00a7170(f)(8) to be obtained by donors.  Accordingly, your\ncontribution of rebate m to Charity may qualify as a charitable contribution by you under\nsection 170(c).  \nCONCLUSIONS\nBased strictly on all of the facts submitted and representations made, we conclude:  \n1.  The value of m received as rebates for products or services purchased from\nparticipating merchants is not included in your gross income under \u00a761 but rather is\ntreated as a reduction in basis of the property purchased under \u00a71016.  \n2.  The contribution of rebates of m to a charitable organization described in \u00a7170(c) by\nCompany, acting as an your agent, may qualify as a charitable contribution by you\nunder section 170(c).    \nCAVEATS:\nYou have not requested a ruling, and we express no opinion, concerning whether you\nare allowed a charitable contribution deduction for the value of the bonus points\ncontributed to a charity, or whether the bonus points are excludable from your income.\nA copy of this letter must be attached to any income tax return to which it is relevant. \nWe enclose a copy of the letter for this purpose.

Additional information was\nsubmitted in letters dated October 15, 2002, November 7, 2002, November 22, 2002,\nand December 4, 2002.  The information submitted for consideration is summarized\nbelow.\nFacts\nDistributing is a State X corporation incorporated in Year A and has engaged in\nBusiness A since its formation.  Distributing is a calendar year, non-public, subchapter\nC corporation that uses the cash method of accounting.  Distributing is not a member of\nan affiliated member of a group filing consolidated returns. \nSince its formation, Distributing has had only one class of authorized, issued and\noutstanding stock.  A# shares of Distributing stock are outstanding.  The outstanding\nshares are held as follows: (1) Trust A (a trust held for the benefit of Shareholder A,\nShareholder B, Shareholder C and Shareholder D) directly holds B# shares\nrepresenting A% of Distributing; (2) Excluding any ownership attributable to the\nbeneficiaries from Trust A, Shareholder A, Shareholder B, Shareholder C and\nShareholder D will each directly own C# shares of Distributing representing a total of\nB% of the stock of Distributing.  Prior to the proposed transaction, the B# shares held\nby Trust A will be distributed to the beneficiaries of the trust.  Distributing has no\nsecurity holders.\nFollowing the distribution from the trust and prior to the proposed transaction, the A#\noutstanding shares of Distributing stock will be held as follows: (1) Shareholder A will\nown D# shares representing C% of Distributing; (2) Shareholder B, Shareholder C and\nShareholder D will each own E# shares (D% of the shares) representing a total of E%\nof the ownership of Distributing.  \n3\nPLR-147500-02\nProposed Transaction\nThe shareholders of Distributing have had continuing disputes and disagreements\nbetween each other with respect to the management and operation of Business A as\nconducted in Distributing.  These disputes adversely affect the normal operations of the\nbusiness.  The shareholders have decided to engage in a split-off so that the\nshareholders may each go their separate way.  To effect the separation of Business A,\nDistributing proposes the following Transaction: \nDistributing will form three wholly owned subsidiary corporations: Controlled 1;\nControlled 2; and Controlled 3 (sometimes hereinafter referred to together as\n\u201cControlled Corporations\u201d) that will be incorporated in State X.  Distributing will transfer\nassets and liabilities of Distributing to each of the three Controlled Corporations.  The\nassets and liabilities transferred to each of the Controlled Corporations will be equal to\nD% of the value of Distributing prior to the transfer.  All of the stock (and solely stock) of\nControlled 1, Controlled 2 and Controlled 3 will be issued to Distributing.\nDistributing will transfer: (1) the Controlled 1 stock Shareholder B; (2) Controlled 2 stock\nto Shareholder C; and (3) Controlled 3 stock to Shareholder D in exchange for all of\ntheir Distributing stock.  Shareholder A will hold all of the Distributing stock after the\nsplit-off.\nFollowing the transaction, neither Controlled 1, Controlled 2 nor Controlled 3 will be\nindebted to Distributing. \nRepresentations\nThe following representations are made with respect to the Proposed Transaction:\n(a)\nDistributing and Controlled 1 and their respective shareholders will each pay their\nown expenses, if any, incurred in connection with the transaction.\n(b)\nDistributing and Controlled 2 and their respective shareholders will each pay their\nown expenses, if any, incurred in connection with the transaction.\n(c)\nDistributing and Controlled 3 and their respective shareholders will each pay their\nown expenses, if any, incurred in connection with the transaction.\n(d)\nThe fair market value of the Controlled 1, Controlled 2 and Controlled 3 stock to\nbe received by each of the respective shareholders of Distributing will be\napproximately equal to the fair market value of the Distributing stock surrendered\nby the shareholder in the exchange.\n4\nPLR-147500-02\n(e)\nNo part of the consideration to be distributed by Distributing will be received by a\nshareholder as a creditor, employee, or in any capacity other than that of a\nshareholder of the corporation.\n(f)\nThe 5 years of financial information submitted on behalf of Distributing is\nrepresentative of the corporation\u2019s present operation, and with regard to such\ncorporation, there have been no substantial operational changes since the date\nof the last financial statements submitted.\n(g)\nFollowing the transaction, Distributing, Controlled 1, Controlled 2 and Controlled\n3 will each continue, independently and with its separate employees, the active\nconduct of its share of all the integrated activities of the business conducted by\nthe Distributing prior to consummation of the transaction.\n(h)\nThe distributions of the stock of the Controlled 1, Controlled 2 and Controlled 3\nwill be carried out to eliminate shareholder disputes that, if permitted to continue,\nwould jeopardize the operation and continued success of the corporate\nbusiness.\nThe distribution of the stock of the Controlled Corporations is motivated, in whole\nor substantial part, by this corporate business purposes.  \n(i)\nThere is no plan or intention by the shareholders of Distributing to sell,\nexchange, transfer by gift, or otherwise dispose of any of their stock in, or\nsecurities of, either Distributing, Controlled 1, Controlled 2 or Controlled 3 after\nthe transaction except for transfers by gift to family members of the transferor for\nno consideration.\n(j)\nDistributing is a C corporation.  The Controlled Corporations do not plan to elect\nS corporation status.\nDistributing is not an S corporation (within the meaning of section 1361(a)), and\nthere is no plan or intention by Distributing to make an S corporation election\npursuant to section 1362(a). \n(k)\nThere is no plan or intention by either Distributing or the Controlled Corporations,\ndirectly or through any subsidiary corporation, to purchase any of its outstanding\nstock after the transaction, other than through stock purchases meeting the\nrequirements of section 4.05(1)(b) of Rev. Proc. 96-30, 1996-1 C.B. 696, 705.\n(l)\nThere is no plan or intention to liquidate either Distributing, Controlled 1,\nControlled 2 or Controlled 3, to merge any of these corporations with any other\ncorporation, or to sell or otherwise dispose of the assets of any of these\ncorporations after the distributions, except in the ordinary course of business.\n5\nPLR-147500-02\n(m)\nThe total adjusted basis and the fair market value of the assets transferred to\nControlled 1 in the Controlled 1 transfer, Controlled 2 in the Controlled 2 transfer,\nand Controlled 3 in the Controlled 3 transfer by Distributing in the transaction will,\nin each instance, equal or exceed the sum of the liabilities assumed (as\ndetermined under section 357(d)) by Controlled 1, Controlled 2 and Controlled 3,\nrespectively. \n(n)\nThe liabilities assumed (as determined under section 357(d)) in the Controlled 1\ntransfer, Controlled 2 transfer and the Controlled 3 transfer were incurred in the\nordinary course of business and are associated with the assets being\ntransferred. \n(o)\nThe income tax liability for the taxable year in which investment credit property\n(including any building to which section 47(d) applies) is transferred will be\nadjusted pursuant to section 50(a)(1) or (a)(2) (or section 47, as in effect before\namendment by Public Law 101-508, Title 11, 104 Stat. 1388, 536 (1990), if\napplicable) to reflect an early disposition of the property.\n(p)\nDistributing neither accumulated its receivables nor made extraordinary payment\nof its payables in anticipation of the transaction.\n(q)\nNo intercorporate debt will exist between Distributing, Controlled 1, Controlled 2\nand Controlled 3 at the time of, or subsequent to, the distribution of the\nControlled Corporation's stock.\n(r)\nNo two parties to the transaction are investment companies as defined in section\n368(a)(2)(F)(iii) and (iv).\n(s)\nPayments made in connection with all continuing transactions, if any, between\nDistributing and Controlled Corporations will be for fair market value based on\nterms and conditions arrived at by the parties bargaining at arm\u2019s length.\n(t)\nThe gross assets of the trades or businesses relied on to satisfy the active\nbusiness requirement of section 355(b) will have a fair market value that is 5\npercent or more of the total fair market value of the gross assets of the\ncorporation directly conducting the trades or businesses.\n(u)\nFor purposes of section 355(d), immediately after the Distributions no person\n(determined after applying section 355(d)(7)) will hold stock possessing 50\npercent or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of Distributing\nstock entitled to vote, or 50 percent or more of the total value of shares of all\nclasses of Distributing stock, that was acquired by purchase (as defined in\n6\nPLR-147500-02\nsection 355(d)(5) and (8)) during the five-year period (determined after applying\nsection 355(d)(6)) ending on the date of each distribution.\n(v)\nFor purposes of section 355(d), immediately after the Distributions no person\n(determined after applying section 355(d)(7)) will hold stock possessing 50\npercent or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of\neither Controlled 1, Controlled 2 or Controlled 3 entitled to vote, or 50 percent or\nmore of the total value of shares of all classes of stock of said corporations, that\nwas either (i) acquired by purchase (as defined in section 355(d)(5) and (8))\nduring the five-year period (determined after applying section 355(d)(6)) ending\non the date of the distribution or (ii) attributable to distributions on Distributing\nstock that was acquired by purchase (as defined in section 355(d)(5) and (8))\nduring the five-year period (determined after applying section 355(d)(6)) ending\non the date of the distribution.\n(w)\nThe distributions are not part of a plan or series of related transactions (within\nthe meaning of section 355(e)) pursuant to which one or more persons will\nacquire, directly or indirectly, stock possessing 50 percent or more of the total\ncombined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote of either\nDistributing, Controlled 1, Controlled 2 or Controlled 3, or stock possessing 50\npercent or more of the total value of all classes of stock of either Distributing,\nControlled 1, Controlled 2 or Controlled 3.\nRulings\nBased on the information submitted and the representations made, it is held as follows:\n(1)\nThe transfer by Distributing to Controlled Corporations of the assets associated\nwith its Business A solely in exchange for all of the outstanding Controlled 1,\nControlled 2 and Controlled 3 voting stock and the assumption of liabilities,\nfollowed by the distribution of all the Controlled 1, Controlled 2 and Controlled 3\nvoting stock to Distributing's shareholders in exchange for stock in Distributing,\nas described above, will be a reorganization within the meaning of section\n368(a)(1)(D).  Distributing, Controlled 1, Controlled 2 and Controlled 3 will each\nbe \"a party to a reorganization\" within the meaning of section 368(b).\n(2)\nDistributing will recognize no gain or loss upon the transfer of the Distributing\nassets to Controlled 1 in exchange for Controlled 1 stock and the assumption of\nliabilities by Controlled 1 of Distributing\u2019s liabilities, as described above (sections\n361(a) and 357(a)).\n(3)\nDistributing will recognize no gain or loss upon the transfer of the Distributing\nassets to Controlled 2 in exchange for Controlled 2 stock and the assumption of\n7\nPLR-147500-02\nliabilities by Controlled 2 of Distributing\u2019s liabilities, as described above (sections\n361(a) and 357(a)).\n(4)\nDistributing will recognize no gain or loss upon the transfer of the Distributing\nassets to Controlled 3 in exchange for Controlled 3 stock and the assumption of\nliabilities by Controlled 3 of Distributing\u2019s liabilities, as described above (sections\n361(a) and 357(a)).\n(5)\nControlled 1, Controlled 2 and Controlled 3 will recognize no gain or loss on the\nreceipt of assets and liabilities of Distributing in exchange for the Controlled 1,\nControlled 2 and Controlled 3 stock, as described above (section 1032(a)).\n(6)\nControlled 1, Controlled 2 and Controlled 3's basis of the assets received will be\nthe same as the basis of such assets in the hands of Distributing immediately\nprior to the exchange (section 362(b)).\n(7)\nControlled 1, Controlled 2 and Controlled 3's holding period for each asset\nreceived from Distributing will include the period during which such assets were\nheld by Distributing (section 1223(2)).\n(8)\nNo gain or loss will be recognized to (and no amount will be included in the\nincome of) the shareholders of Distributing upon their receipt of the stock of\nControlled 1, Controlled 2 and Controlled 3, as the case may be, in exchange for\ntheir Distributing stock (section 355(a)(1)).\n(9)\nThe holding period of the Controlled 1, Controlled 2 and Controlled 3 stock\nreceived by the Distributing shareholders will include the holding period of their\nDistributing stock with respect to which the distribution is made, provided that the\nDistributing stock is held as a capital asset on the date of distribution (section\n1223(1)).\n(10)\nAs provided in section 312(h), proper allocation of earnings and profits between\nDistributing and Controlled 1, Controlled 2 and Controlled 3 will be made in\naccordance with section 1.312-10(a).\n(11)\nNo gain or loss will be recognized to Distributing upon the distribution of its stock\nin Controlled 1, Controlled 2 and Controlled 3 to its shareholders\n(section 361(c)(1) and section 355(c)(1)).\n(12)\nThe basis of Controlled 1, Controlled 2 and Controlled 3 stock in the hands of\neach respective controlling shareholder: Shareholder B, Shareholder C and\nShareholder D, after the distribution, will equal the basis of the Distributing stock\nsurrendered by each such shareholder in exchange therefor (section 358(a)(1)).\n8\nPLR-147500-02\nExcept as expressly provided herein, no opinion is expressed or implied concerning the\ntax consequences of any aspect of any transaction or item discussed or referenced in\nthis letter.\nThis ruling is directed only to the taxpayer requesting it.  Section 6110(k)(3) of the Code\nprovides that it may not be used or cited as precedent.\nIn accordance with the Power of Attorney on file with this office, a copy of this letter is\nbeing sent to your authorized representative.\nA copy of this letter must be attached to any income tax return to which it is relevant.\nThe rulings contained in this letter are based upon information and representations\nsubmitted by the taxpayer and accompanied by a penalty of perjury statement executed\nby an appropriate party.

-------------------: \n \n \nThis letter responds to your March 7, 2007 letter requesting rulings on certain \nfederal income tax consequences of a series of proposed transactions.  The information \nsubmitted in that request and later correspondence is summarized below. \n \n \nThe rulings contained in this letter are based on facts and representations \nsubmitted by the taxpayer and accompanied by a penalty of perjury statement executed \nby an appropriate party.  This office has not verified any of the materials submitted in \nsupport of the request for rulings.  Verification of the information, representations, and \nother data may be required as part of the audit process.   \n \n \nIn particular, this office has not reviewed any information pertaining to whether \nany distribution (each described below): (i) satisfies the business purpose requirement \nof \u00a7 1.355-2(b); (ii) is used principally as a device for the distribution of earnings and \nprofits of the distributing corporation or the controlled corporation or both (see \n\u00a7 355(a)(1)(B) and \u00a7 1.355-2(d)); and (iii) is part of a plan (or series of related \ntransactions) pursuant to which one or more persons will acquire directly or indirectly \nstock representing a 50-percent or greater interest in any distributing corporation or \ncontrolled corporation (see \u00a7 355(e) and \u00a7 1.355-7). \n \nSummary of Facts  \n \n \nDistributing is the common parent of an affiliated group of corporations that files a \nconsolidated federal income tax return.  Distributing is a publicly traded domestic \ncorporation with a single class of common stock outstanding.  Distributing directly owns \nall of the outstanding interests in LLC 1 and LLC 3, each of which is a disregarded entity \nfor federal income tax purposes, and all of the outstanding stock of Sub 1, Sub 2, Sub 3, \nSub 4 and Sub 13.  Distributing also owns all of the outstanding common stock of Sub \n5, and a% (less than 1%) of the outstanding common stock of Sub 6.  Sub 5 owns all \nthe remaining b% of the outstanding common stock of Sub 6.  Sub 5 owns all of the \noutstanding stock of FSub 1 and FSub 2.  FSub 2 owns all of the outstanding stock of \nFSub 3.   \n \n \nPLR-111641-07 \n \n \n6 \n \nSub 6 owns all of the outstanding stock of FSub 4, a disregarded entity for \nfederal income tax purposes.  FSub 4 owns all of the outstanding stock of FSub 5.  Sub \n6 also own securities of FSub 5 (the \u201cEquity Securities\u201d) that Distributing has treated as \nequity of FSub 5 for federal income tax purposes.  FSub 5 owns all of the outstanding \nstock of FSub 6 and FSub 7, and indirectly owns all of the outstanding stock of FSub 9.  \nOn Date A, FSub 5 transferred to FSub 6 all of the outstanding stock of FSub 8, a \ndisregarded entity for federal income tax purposes and then on Date B also transferred \ncash to FSub 6 (The \u201cFSub 5 Transfers\u201d).  \n \n \nLLC 1 owns all of the outstanding stock of Sub 7 and Sub 8.  Sub 7 owns all of \nthe outstanding stock of Controlled, Sub 9, and Sub 10.  From Date C until Date D, \nControlled owned all the stock of Sub 12 which converted on Date D to LLC 2.  \nControlled continues to own all of the outstanding interests in LLC 2, a disregarded \nentity for federal income tax purposes and all of the stock of Sub 11.   \n \n \nDistributing is engaged through its subsidiaries in several businesses, including \nBusiness A and Business B.  Distributing has submitted financial information indicating \nthat each of Business A and Business B (as conducted by FSub 8) has had gross \nreceipts and operating expenses representing the active conduct of a trade or business \nfor each of the past five years. \n \n \nAs part of Distributing\u2019s conduct of Business A, Sub 13 and FSub 9 hold, and \nmay continue to hold after the Distribution, certain debt instruments of Controlled as Q \n(\u201cQ Debt\u201d).  Sub 13 may also hold some stock of Controlled as Q after the Distribution. \n \n \nLLC 2 has brought a lawsuit (the \u201cLitigation\u201d) seeking damages for certain actions \ntaken by the named defendants in the Litigation, beginning around Date E.  The \nLitigation will not go to trial until after the Distribution (as defined below), and even if the \nLitigation is settled before the Distribution occurs, it is possible that LLC 2 may receive \nsome or all of the proceeds of any such settlement after the Distribution.  In conjunction \nwith the Proposed Transaction, Controlled will declare a dividend payable to Sub 7 (the \n\u201cSpecial Dividend\u201d).  The Special Dividend will obligate Controlled to pay Sub 7 an \namount, not to exceed a specified amount based on the outcome of the Litigation. \n \n \nConsistent with its historical dividend practices, Controlled, on Date F, paid a \ncash dividend of $c to Sub 7.  Additionally, before the Distribution is consummated, \nControlled will declare and pay one or more cash dividends to Sub 7 in an aggregate \namount currently expected to be at least $d (collectively, the \u201cCash Dividends\u201d). \n \n \nDistributing desires to separate Business B from its other businesses for several \nbusiness reasons including: (a) to allow the management of each of Distributing and \nControlled to focus its efforts on more closely aligned respective firm-wide strategic \npriorities; (b) to increase the ability of Controlled to pursue strategic transactions, \nincluding by using its own equity as an acquisition currency; (c) to enhance the ability of \n \nPLR-111641-07 \n \n \n7 \nControlled to attract, retain and properly incentivize key employees, particularly through \nthe use of its own equity; and (d) to eliminate the possibility that Distributing or \nControlled will be placed at a competitive disadvantage relative to its peers because \npotential clients and strategic partners view Controlled or Distributing, respectively, as a \ncompetitor. \n \nProposed Transaction \n \n \nTo effect the separation of Business A and Business B, Distributing has \nproposed the following series of transactions (collectively, the \u201cProposed Transaction\u201d): \n \n \n(i) \nSub 7 will merge with and into LLC 1, with LLC 1 surviving (the \u201cSub 7 \nMerger\u201d). \n \n \n(ii) \nLLC 1 will contribute the stock of Sub 9, preferred stock of Sub 5 and \ncertain other assets received from Sub 7 in the Sub 7 Merger to Sub 8 (the \u201cLLC 1 \nContribution\u201d). \n \n \n(iii) \nLLC 1 will distribute the stock of Controlled to Distributing. \n \n \n(iv) \nFSub 6 will distribute all of its assets, subject to its liabilities, to FSub 5 in \na complete liquidation of FSub 6 under Country A law (the \u201cFSub 6 Liquidation\u201d). \n \n \n(v) \nFSub 8 will create FNewco and contribute all of its assets (which may \ninclude cash) and liabilities associated with Business B in exchange for all the shares of \nFNewco (the \u201cFSub 8 Contribution\u201d). \n \n \n(vi) \nFSub 8 will transfer all of the stock of FNewco to FSub 5 in exchange for \ncash, in a transaction that is disregarded for federal income tax purposes.  \n \n \n(vii) \nFSub 5 will contribute all of the stock of FSub 7, and possibly cash, to \nFNewco in exchange for shares of FNewco (together with FSub 8 Contribution, the \n\u201cFSub 5 Contribution\u201d). \n \n \n(viii) \nFSub 5 will distribute some of the stock of FNewco to FSub 4 and the \nremainder of the stock of FNewco to Sub 6 (in respect of the Equity Securities), and \nFSub 4 will then transfer the stock of FNewco it receives to Sub 6 (the two transactions \ncollectively, the \u201cFSub 5 Internal Distribution\u201d). \n \n \n(ix) \nSub 6 will distribute all of the stock of FNewco to Sub 5 and Distributing \n(the \u201cSub 6 Internal Distribution\u201d). \n \n \n(x) \nSub 5 will distribute the stock of FNewco to Distributing (the \u201cSub 5 \nInternal Distribution\u201d). \n \nPLR-111641-07 \n \n \n8 \n \n \n(xi) \nFor state law purposes, Sub 4 will merge with and into LLC 3. \n \n \n(xii) \nDistributing will contribute all of the stock of Sub 1, Sub 2, Sub 3 and \nFNewco (the \u201cContributed Subsidiaries\u201d) to Controlled in exchange for additional shares \nof Controlled common stock and the Special Dividend (the \u201cContribution\u201d).  Pursuant to \nthe plan of reorganization, Distributing will, within one year of receipt of any cash paid \nafter the Distribution in respect of the Special Dividend (\u201cSpecial Dividend Cash\u201d), (a) \nrepay liabilities owed to creditors of Distributing in accordance with \u00a7 361(b)(3) and/or \n(b) distribute to Distributing shareholders either by repurchases of Distributing stock or \nby making a cash distributions.  \n \n \n(xiii) \nControlled will contribute all of the stock of FNewco to Sub 11.  Controlled \nmay also contribute the stock of Sub 2 and Sub 3 to Sub 11 at a later time. \n \n \n(xiv) \nDistributing will distribute all of the stock of Controlled pro rata to \nDistributing\u2019s shareholders (the \u201cDistribution\u201d). \n \n \nIn conjunction with the Proposed Transaction, Distributing and Controlled will \nenter into several agreements (the \u201cTransaction Agreements\u201d) relating to the separation \nof Business B from Distributing\u2019s other businesses, and certain continuing transactions \nbetween the companies, including, among others, a tax-sharing agreement, and an \nagreement for services during a transition period which is generally not expected to \nexceed e months, with compensation generally based on allocated costs including \ncorporate overhead (\u201cTransition Services\u201d).  The Transaction Agreements will also \ninclude: (i) agreements relating to post-Distribution intercompany funding provided by \nDistributing to Controlled and its subsidiaries (the \u201cIntercompany Funding \nArrangements\u201d), which is not expected to exceed $f, will have a term not in excess of g \nmonths, and will bear an arm\u2019s length rate of interest and otherwise have arm\u2019s length \ncommercially reasonable terms for financings of this type; (ii) an agreement with a term \nof g months pursuant to which funds belonging to certain clients of Distributing may be \nplaced on deposit with Sub 11, (iii) a license agreement pursuant to which Controlled \nand its subsidiaries will be entitled to use, on a royalty-free basis, certain Distributing \ntrademarks in connection with Business B for up to h years after the Distribution, \n(iv) certain subleases with respect to shared facilities on rental and other terms \nconsistent with arm\u2019s length commercially reasonable terms for agreements of this type, \n(v) an agreement relating to the provision of certain services by subsidiaries of \nDistributing and Controlled to each other on an arm\u2019s length basis for a period not to \nexceed e months, and (vi) an agreement relating to the provision by Distributing of \ncertain Business A services to Controlled for a period of h years, on terms consistent \nwith arm\u2019s length agreements between unrelated parties. \n \n \nIn addition, each of Sub 11 and LLC 2 has entered, in the ordinary course of \nbusiness, into certain financial contracts (the \u201cContracts\u201d) with a subsidiary of \n \nPLR-111641-07 \n \n \n9 \nDistributing.  The Contracts have arm\u2019s length terms and have varying maturity dates \nranging from Date G to Date H.  The Contracts are expected to remain outstanding after \nthe Distribution in accordance with their terms. \n \n \nIn connection with the Distribution, Controlled and Sub 11 will enter into a \ncommitted credit facility (the \u201cCredit Facility\u201d).  The lead arrangers on the Credit Facility \nwill be unrelated financial institutions, who will syndicate the commitments under the \nCredit Facility.  Distributing or a subsidiary may participate in the syndicate on the same \nterms and conditions as other members of the syndicate, which terms and conditions \nwill be negotiated at arm\u2019s length by the lead arrangers on behalf of the syndicate and \nwill be customary commercial terms.  The term for any loan from Distributing or a \nsubsidiary that will be outstanding under the Credit Facility will be less than i years. \n \nREPRESENTATIONS \n \n \nDistributing makes the following representations regarding the Sub 7 Merger: \n \n \n(a) \nDistributing has no plan or intention to sell or otherwise dispose of any of \nthe assets of Sub 7 acquired in the Sub 7 Merger, except for (i) dispositions made in the \nordinary course of business, (ii) the LLC 1 Contribution and (iii) the Distribution. \n \n \n(b) \nThe liabilities of Sub 7 assumed (within the meaning of \u00a7 357(d)) by \nDistributing were incurred by Sub 7 in the ordinary course of its business and are \nassociated with the assets transferred. \n \n \n(c) \nFollowing the Sub 7 Merger, Distributing will continue the historic business \nof Sub 7 or use a significant portion of Sub 7\u2019s historic business assets in a business \nwithin the meaning of \u00a7 1.368-1(d). \n \n \n(d) \nThe Sub 7 Merger will be carried out to facilitate the Distribution. \n \n \n(e) \nNo intercorporate indebtedness exists between Sub 7 and Distributing that \nwas issued, acquired, or will be settled at a discount. \n \n \n(f) \nNo two parties to the Sub 7 Merger are investment companies as defined \nin \u00a7 368(a)(2)(F)(iii) and (iv). \n \n \n(g) \nSub 7 is not under the jurisdiction of a court in a Title 11 or similar case \nwithin the meaning of \u00a7 368(a)(3)(A). \n \n \n(h) \nThe total fair market value of the assets of Sub 7 transferred to \nDistributing will equal or exceed the sum of (i) the liabilities assumed (as determined \nunder \u00a7 357(d)) by Distributing in connection with the Sub 7 Merger, and (ii) the amount \n \nPLR-111641-07 \n \n \n10 \nof liabilities, if any, owed by Sub 7 to Distributing that are discharged or extinguished in \nthe Sub 7 Merger. \n \n \nDistributing makes the following representations regarding the FSub 6 \nLiquidation: \n \n \n(i) \nFSub 5, on the date of the adoption of the plan of liquidation, and at all \ntimes until the final liquidating distribution is completed, will be the owner of at least 80 \npercent of the single outstanding class of FSub 6 stock. \n \n \n(j) \nNo shares of FSub 6 stock will have been redeemed during the three \nyears preceding the adoption of the plan of complete liquidation of FSub 6. \n \n \n(k) \nFSub 6 will adopt a plan of liquidation specifying that the final liquidating \ndistribution is to be completed within three years from the close of the taxable year of \nFSub 6 in which the first liquidating distribution is made. \n \n \n(l) \nAs soon as the first liquidating distribution has been made, FSub 6 will \ncease to be a going concern and its activities will be limited to winding up its affairs, \npaying its debts and distributing its remaining assets to its shareholder. \n \n \n(m) \nFSub 6 will retain no assets following the final liquidating distribution. \n \n \n(n) \nFSub 6 will not have acquired assets in any nontaxable transaction at any \ntime, except for acquisitions occurring more than three years prior to the date of \nadoption of the plan of liquidation and in the FSub 5 Transfers.  \n \n \n(o) \nNo FSub 6 assets have been, or will be, disposed of by FSub 6 or FSub 5 \nexcept for dispositions in the ordinary course of business, dispositions occurring more \nthan three years before the adoption of the plan of liquidation and transfers occurring as \npart of the Proposed Transaction. \n \n \n(p) \nExcept for the FSub 8 Contribution, the liquidation of FSub 6 into FSub 5 \nwill not be preceded or followed by the reincorporation in, or transfer or sale to, a \nrecipient corporation (\u201cRecipient\u201d) of any of the businesses or assets of FSub 6, if \npersons holding, directly or indirectly, more than 20 percent in value of the FSub 6 stock \nalso hold, directly or indirectly, more than 20 percent of the stock in Recipient.

The Funds request consent \nto revoke, for tax Year A and subsequent calendar years, previous elections \nmade by the Funds under section 4982(e)(4)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code.  \nAdditionally, the Funds request that the calculation of their required distributions \nunder sections 4982(b)(1) and 4982(e) for the calendar year ending December \n31, Year A, be determined on the basis of capital gains and losses, and foreign \ncurrency gains and losses, if any, realized and recognized during the ten-month \nperiod from January 1, Year A, through October 31, Year A.\n \n \nFACTS\nThe Funds are registered as investment companies under the Investment \nCompany Act of 1940, as amended, and each Fund has elected to be treated as \na regulated investment company (a \u201cRIC\u201d) for federal income tax purposes under \npart I of subchapter M of the Code.  Each Fund is an open-end fund.   Each \nFund\u2019s taxable year ends on December 31. \nBetween Year B and Year C, pursuant to section 4982(e)(4)(A), the Funds \nelected to use their tax year ending on December 31 in lieu of the 1-year period \nending on October 31, for purposes of calculating the required distribution under \nsections 4982(b)(1)(B), 4982(e)(2), and 4982(e)(5).\nAt the time the Funds originally made their elections, they believed that \nthe elections under section 4982 would relieve the administrative burdens \nassociated with dual calculations of capital gains and losses under the excise tax \nand Subchapter M provisions of the Code.  However, the Funds\u2019 experience has \nbeen that the section 4982(e)(4)(A) elections have created additional \nadministrative complexities primarily due to time constraints in declaring required \nexcise tax distributions.  \nAccordingly, each Fund seeks consent to revoke its election to use the \ntaxable year for purposes of sections 4982(b) and 4982(e).  The Funds make the \nfollowing representations:\n1. The desire to revoke the Funds\u2019 section 4982(e)(4)(A) elections is due to \nPLR-135170-10\n3\nadministrative and non-tax related financial burdens caused by the \nelections.\n2. The Funds are not seeking to revoke their elections for the purpose of \npreserving or securing a tax benefit.\n3. The Funds will neither benefit through hindsight nor prejudice the interests \nof the government as a result of being permitted to revoke their elections.\n4. The Funds will not make any subsequent elections under       \nsection 4982(e)(4)(A) for five (5) calendar years following the year of the \ngrant of revocation.\nLAW AND ANALYSIS \nSection 4982(a), which was enacted as part of the Tax Reform Act of \n1986 and is effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 1986, imposes \nan excise tax on every RIC for each calendar year equal to 4 percent of the \nexcess, if any, of the \u201crequired distribution\u201d over the \u201cdistributed amount\u201d for the \ncalendar year.\nSection 4982(b)(1) defines the term \u201crequired distribution\u201d to mean, with \nrespect to any calendar year, the sum of 98 percent of the RIC\u2019s ordinary income \nfor such calendar year, plus 98 percent of its capital gain net income for the 1-\nyear period ending on October 31 of such calendar year.\nSection 4982(e)(4)(A) provides that if the tax year of a RIC ends with the \nmonth of November or December, the RIC may elect to have its capital gain net \nincome for its tax year applied in lieu of the 1-year period ending on October 31 \nof the calendar year for purposes of satisfying the required distribution defined in \nsection 4982(b)(1).  Section 4982(e)(4)(B) provides that, once made, such \nelection may be revoked only with the consent of the Secretary.\nSection 4982(e)(5) provides that any foreign currency gain or loss \nattributable to a section 988 transaction and which is properly taken into account \nfor the portion of the calendar year after October 31 shall not be taken into \naccount in determining the ordinary income of the RIC for the calendar year but \nshall be taken into account in determining the RIC\u2019s ordinary income in the \nfollowing calendar year.  However, if a RIC has made an election under section \n4982(e)(4), the preceding sentence shall be applied by substituting the last day \nof the RIC\u2019s taxable year for October 31.\nSection 4982(e)(6) provides that, for purposes of determining a RIC\u2019s \nordinary income (as defined in section 4982(e)(1)), section 1296 shall be applied \nas if the RIC\u2019s taxable year ended on October 31, and any ordinary gain or loss \nfrom an actual disposition of stock in a passive foreign investment company \nPLR-135170-10\n4\nduring the portion of the calendar year after October 31 shall be taken into \naccount in determining the RIC\u2019s ordinary income for the following calendar year.   \nHowever, if a RIC has made an election under section 4982(e)(4), the preceding \nsentence shall be applied by substituting the last day of the RIC\u2019s taxable year \nfor October 31.\nBased upon the information submitted and the representations made, we \nconclude that the Funds\u2019 desire to revoke their elections under section \n4982(e)(4)(A) of the Code is because of administrative burdens and not because \nof any federal tax-related financial burden caused by the election.  The Funds do \nnot seek to revoke their elections for the purpose of preserving or securing a \nfederal tax benefit.  Additionally, the Funds will neither benefit through hindsight \nnor prejudice the interest of the government as a result of being permitted to \nrevoke their elections.\nCONCLUSION\nAccordingly, based upon the representations made and pursuant to \nsection 4982(e)(4)(B), the Secretary consents to the revocation of the elections \nmade by the Funds under section 4982(e)(4)(A), effective for calendar Year A \nand subsequent years.  In addition, in calculating the \u201crequired distribution\u201d for \ncalendar Year A, for purposes of section 4982(b)(1) and (e), the capital gain net \nincome, foreign currency gains and losses, and gains and losses of the Funds \nrecognized under section 1296 will be determined on the basis of the capital\ngains and losses, foreign currency gains and losses, and gains and losses \nrecognized under section 1296, if any, realized and recognized during the 10-\nmonth period from January 1, Year A, through October 31, Year A.   \nAs a condition to the Secretary\u2019s consent to the revocation pursuant to \nsection 4982(e)(4)(B), the Funds may not make subsequent elections under \nsection 4982(e)(4)(A) for a period of five (5) calendar years following the year to \nwhich the grant of revocation applies (i.e. Year D through Year E).\nExcept as specifically ruled upon above, no opinion is expressed or \nimplied as to any other federal excise or income tax consequences.\nPLR-135170-10\n5\nThis ruling is directed only to the taxpayers requesting it.  Section \n6110(k)(3) provides that it may not be used or cited as precedent.\nIt is important that a copy of this letter be attached to the federal income \nand excise tax returns filed by the Funds for the year to which this ruling applies.\n \nSincerely yours,\n  \n \n \n__________________________\n \n \n \nAlice M.

While this office has not verified any of\nthe material submitted in support of the request for rulings, it is subject to verification on\nexamination. The information submitted for consideration is substantially as set forth\nbelow.\nA intends to relinquish his United States citizenship (\u201cexpatriate\u201d) shortly\nafter the ruling process is complete.   A was born in Country B and is currently a citizen\nand resident of Country B.  A has never lived in the United States.     \nSection 877 generally provides that a citizen who loses U.S. citizenship or\na U.S. long-term resident who ceases to be taxed as a lawful permanent resident\n(individuals who \"expatriate\") within the 10-year period immediately preceding the close\nof the taxable year will be taxed under section 877(b) and the special rules of section\n877(d) for such taxable year, unless such loss did not have for one of its principal\npurposes the avoidance of U.S. taxes.  Sections 2107 and 2501(a)(3) provide special\nestate and gift tax regimes, respectively, for individuals who expatriate with a principal\npurpose to avoid U.S. taxes.       \nA former citizen or former long term-resident will be treated as having\nexpatriated with a principal purpose to avoid U.S. taxes for purposes of sections 877,\n2107 and 2501(a)(3) if the individual's average income tax liability or the individual's net\nworth on the date of expatriation exceed certain thresholds.  See sections 877(a)(2),\n2107(a)(2)(A) and 2501(a)(3)(B). \nPLR-102210-02\nPage 2\nA former U.S. citizen or former long term-resident whose net worth or\naverage tax liability exceeds these thresholds, however, will not be presumed to have a\nprincipal purpose of tax avoidance if that former citizen is described within certain\nstatutory categories and submits a request for a ruling within one year of the date of\nloss of U.S. citizenship for the Secretary\u2019s determination as to whether such loss had\nfor one of its principal purposes the avoidance of U.S. taxes.  See sections 877(c),\n2107(a)(2)(B) and 2501(a)(3)(C). \nNotice 98-34 requires that certain information be submitted with a request\nfor a ruling that an individual\u2019s expatriation did not have for one of its principal purposes\nthe avoidance of U.S. taxes.  A submitted all the information required by Notice 98-34,\nincluding any additional information requested by the Service after review of the\nsubmission.\nA\u2019s net worth is expected to exceed the section 877(a)(2) threshold on the\ndate of his expatriation.   A is eligible to request a ruling because he became at birth\nboth a citizen of the United States and Country B, and continues to be a citizen of such\nother country. Section 877(c)(2)(A)(i).  A submitted his ruling request within one year of\nexpatriation, as required by section 877(c)(1)(B).  \n \nProvided that A expatriates within one year of this letter, and based solely\non the information submitted and the representations made, A has made a complete\nand good faith submission in accordance with section 877(c)(1)(B). However, because\nthe information submitted does not clearly establish either the existence or lack of a\nprincipal purpose to avoid taxes under subtitle A or B of the Code, no opinion is\nexpressed as to whether A's expatriation had for one of its principal purposes the\navoidance of such taxes.  While this ruling rebuts the presumption of tax avoidance\nunder section 877(a)(2), it is not conclusive as to whether A subsequently may be found\nto have a principal purpose of tax avoidance under sections 877(a)(1), 2107(a)(1), and\n2501(a)(3)(A) based on all the facts and circumstances.  See section 877(c)(1).\nExcept as expressly provided herein, no opinion is expressed or implied\nconcerning the tax consequences of any aspect of any transaction or item discussed or\nreferenced in this letter.  In addition, no opinion is expressed as to A's U.S. tax liability\nfor taxable periods prior to his loss of permanent residence status or for taxable periods\nafter his loss of permanent residence status under sections of the Code other than\nsections 877, 2107, and 2501(a)(3).\nA copy of this letter must be attached to A's U.S. income tax return for the\nyear in which A obtained the ruling (whether or not A is otherwise required to file a\nreturn).\nThis ruling is directed only to the taxpayer requesting it.

The information submitted in that request\nand in letters dated June 28 and August 4, 1999,  is substantially as set forth below.\nOn Date 1 (a date prior to January 1, 1987), Target 1, a State X subchapter C\ncorporation, elected to be taxed as a subchapter S corporation.  On Date 2, Target 2, a\nState X subchapter C corporation, elected to be taxed as a subchapter S corporation. \nTarget 2 holds assets subject to the tax imposed on certain built-in gains under \u00a7 1374\nof the Code.  Neither Target 1 nor Target 2 had previously elected to be taxed as\nsubchapter S corporations.  Target 1 and Target 2 each own 50 percent of Subsidiary,\na State X subchapter C corporation.  Target 1, Target 2, and Subsidiary have tax years\nending December 31 and use the accrual method of accounting.  There is significant\noverlap in the shareholders of Target 1 and Target 2.\nParent was incorporated in State X by Targets 1 and 2 on Date 3, and elected to\nbe taxed as a subchapter S corporation as of that date.  Parent has formed Merger Sub\n1 and Merger Sub 2 as State X subchapter C corporations in order to effectuate the\ntransactions described below.  Parent, Merger Sub 1, and Merger Sub 2  have tax\nyears ending December 31 and use the accrual method of accounting.  \nPursuant to the Merger Agreement entered into on Date 4, Merger Sub 1 will\nmerge with Target 1, with Target 1 surviving and the shareholders of Target 1 will\nreceive Parent stock in exchange for their Target 1 stock.  Also pursuant to the Merger\nAgreement, Merger Sub 2 will merge with Target 2, with Target 2 surviving and the\nshareholders of Target 2 will receive Parent stock in exchange for their Target 2 stock. \nAs a result, Target 1 and Target 2 will become wholly owned subsidiaries of Parent. \nThe mergers will be effective on Date 5.  After Parent acquires all of the stock of\nTargets 1 and 2, Targets 1 and 2 will distribute all of the stock of Subsidiary to Parent.\nAlso effective as of Date 5, Parent will elect to treat Target 1, Target 2, and\nSubsidiary as Qualified Subchapter S Subsidiaries (the \u201cQSub Elections\u201d) as defined in\n\u00a7 1361(b)(3)(B).\nPLR-108957-99\n3\nThe following representations have been made with respect to the proposed\ntransaction:\n(a)\nTo the best of the taxpayers\u2019 knowledge and belief, the merger of Merger Sub 1\nwith and into Target 1 qualifies as a reorganization under \u00a7 368(a)(1)(A), by\nvirtue of \u00a7 368(a)(2)(E).\n(b)\nTo the best of the taxpayers\u2019 knowledge and belief, the merger of Merger Sub 2\nwith and into Target 2 qualifies as a reorganization under \u00a7 368(a)(1)(A), by\nvirtue of \u00a7 368(a)(2)(E).\n(c)\nOn the date the Target 1 QSub Election is made, and at all times until the\ndeemed liquidation is completed, Parent will be the owner of at least 80 percent\nof the outstanding stock of Target 1.\n(d)\nOn the date the Target 2 QSub Election is made, and at all times until the\ndeemed liquidation is completed, Parent will be the owner of at least 80 percent\nof the outstanding stock of Target 2.\n(e)\nOn the date the Subsidiary QSub Election is made, and at all times until the\ndeemed liquidation is completed, Parent will be the owner of at least 80 percent\nof the outstanding stock of Subsidiary.\n(f)\nNo shares of Target 1 stock will have been redeemed during the three years\npreceding the adoption of the plan of liquidation.\n(g)\nNo shares of Target 2 stock will have been redeemed during the three years\npreceding the adoption of the plan of liquidation.\n(h)\nNo shares of Subsidiary stock will have been redeemed during the three years\npreceding the adoption of the plan of liquidation.\n(i)\nFor federal tax purposes, Target 1 will not retain any assets following the\ndeemed liquidation of Target 1.\n(j)\nFor federal tax purposes, Target 2 will not retain any assets following the\ndeemed liquidation of Target 2.\n(k)\nFor federal tax purposes, Subsidiary will not retain any assets following the\ndeemed liquidation of Subsidiary.\n(l)\nTarget 1 will not have acquired assets in any nontaxable transactions at any time\nafter the date of its acquisition by Parent, and Target 1 will not have acquired\nassets in any nontaxable transactions except for acquisitions occurring more\nPLR-108957-99\n4\nthan three years prior to the date that parent makes the QSub Election for Target\n1.\n(m)\nTarget 2 will not have acquired assets in any nontaxable transactions at any time\nafter the date of its acquisition by Parent, and Target 2 will not have acquired\nassets in any nontaxable transactions except for acquisitions occurring more\nthan three years prior to the date that parent makes the QSub Election for Target\n2.\n(n)\nSubsidiary will not have acquired assets in any nontaxable transactions at any\ntime after the date of its acquisition by Parent, and Subsidiary will not have\nacquired assets in any nontaxable transactions except for acquisitions occurring\nmore than three years prior to the date that parent makes the QSub Election for\nSubsidiary.\n(o)\nNo assets of Target 1 have been or will be disposed of by Target 1 or Parent\nexcept for dispositions in the ordinary course of business and dispositions\noccurring more than three years prior to Parent\u2019s QSub Election with respect to\nTarget 1.\n(p)\nNo assets of Target 2 have been or will be disposed of by Target 2 or Parent\nexcept for dispositions in the ordinary course of business and dispositions\noccurring more than three years prior to Parent\u2019s QSub Election with

The request is filed under the provisions of Revenue \nProcedure 2008-1, 2008-1 I.R.B. 1.\nFACTS\nA represents that the facts are as follows:\nA is an State limited liability company, taxable as a partnership for federal \nincome tax purposes, consisting of a managing member and an investor member \nand formed on Date 1, for the purpose of constructing and operating the Project.  \nThe Project comprises one phase of a multi-phase project and will encompass \nAmount 1 buildings, with each building housing two apartment units, and certain \nancillary improvements in a two-block neighborhood.  The ancillary \nimprovements are landscaping, a children\u2019s playground, a basketball court, four \nroof/post structures to shade picnic tables, a maintenance building , and related \nland improvements, e.g., driveways, walkways (collectively, the \u201cAncillary \nImprovements\u201d).  \nA intends to construct and operate the Project to meet the requirements of \n\u00a7 42 of the Internal Revenue Code for qualifying for the low-income housing \ncredit.  A received a reservation of Year low-income housing tax credits from the \nState Housing and Finance Association pursuant to the State Housing and \nFinance Association Reservation, dated Date 2, and State Housing and Finance \nAssociation Commitment, dated Date 3, in the amount of Amount 2, and the \nState Housing and Finance Association Reservation for additional credit, dated \nDate 4 in the amount of Amount 3.  Other than the maintenance building, the \nAncillary Improvements were commitments in A\u2019s tax credit application to the \nState Housing and Finance Association.  \nThe Project is being constructed on a large, unimproved tract in City, \nwhich was previously used as farmland.  The Project will spread across more \nthan seven acres with some of the residential rental buildings located more than \nsix hundred feet from the nearest existing arterial streets and infrastructure of \nCity.  Because these buildings would otherwise be cut off from the existing \narterial streets and infrastructure, the Code of City requires A to construct streets \nand other infrastructure improvements to provide residents of the residential \nrental buildings access to the existing streets and infrastructure.\nPLR-130318-08\n3\nThe streets required by the City Code to be constructed by A are two-lane \nlocal streets and include curbs, sidewalks, storm water drainage, and domestic \nwater in-flow.  In addition, A must purchase and install, at its own cost, the \ninfrastructure needed by utility companies to install underground utilities, \nincluding utility steel casings within the streets through which the utilities run gas \nlines, electrical  wiring, cable, and phone wires.\nUpon completion of the improvements required by the City Code, A must \ndedicate all streets to the use of the public.  For this purpose, \u201cstreets\u201d includes \nall of the streets, curbs, sidewalks, storm water drainage, and domestic water in-\nflow improvements required by the City Code.  Further, according to the Office of \nthe City Attorney, City has always held the position that dedication of the streets \ntransfers ownership of the utility steel casings within the streets to City.\nThe City Code requires minimum dimensions for any streets that will be \ndedicated to City.  The dimensions vary depending on whether the street serves \na residential, commercial, or manufacturing district.  City approved the Project\u2019s \nproposed streets based on the characteristics of the Project\u2019s residential rental \nbuildings, without reference to the Ancillary Improvements.\nUnder the City Code, streets of a subdivision are dedicated to the use of \nthe public through City\u2019s process for street dedication.  The process for \ndedicating streets of a proposed subdivision to the public requires three-steps: \n(1) before construction of the streets begins, the owner records a City-approved \nplat showing the subdivision, which delineates and places in the public record \nthose portions of the land belonging to City on which the owner will construct the \nstreets and those portions of the land remaining in the owner's possession, (2) \nthe owner constructs the streets and other infrastructure required by the City\nCode, and (3) upon completion of the streets, City accepts the dedication by \nreleasing building permits for the construction of the buildings of the subdivision. \nBecause of A's strong commitment to the community, City decided to \ndeviate from this third step of the process, by withholding the certificates of \noccupancy for the Project\u2019s buildings, in lieu of the building permits, pending \ncompletion of the required improvements.  Building permits and certificates of \noccupancy are required for the Project\u2019s residential rental buildings.  Other than \nthe maintenance building and the picnic shade structures, the Ancillary \nImprovements do not require building permits or certificates of occupancy.  \nHowever, plat recordation and the building permits for Project\u2019s residential rental \nproperty were not contingent upon A producing the Ancillary Improvements. \nUpon acceptance of the dedication, City will own and maintain the streets \nand the utility steel casings.  Each utility provider will own and maintain its \nrespective connective pipes and wires.\nPLR-130318-08\n4\nIf a developer decides not to construct a project as planned, City will \nmodify the scope of the improvements.  In this case, City would expect more \nstreet construction if the Project expanded and less street construction if the \nProject constricted, without reference to the Ancillary Improvements.\nRULINGS REQUESTED\nA requests that the Internal Revenue Service issue the following rulings:\n1.  The costs incurred by A to construct (a) local streets, (b) curbs, (c) \nsidewalks, (d) storm water drainage, (e) domestic water in-flow, and (f) utilities, \nincluding utility steel casings, wiring, and installation fees (collectively, (a) \nthrough (f) are the \"Infrastructure Improvements\") for the Project are dedicated \nimprovements for purposes of \u00a7 263(a) and \u00a7 1.263(a)-4(d)(8)(iv) of the Income \nTax Regulations and, therefore, are not capitalizable as amounts paid to create \nan intangible.\n2.  The costs incurred by A to construct the Infrastructure Improvements \nare indirect costs within the meaning of \u00a7 1.263A-1(e)(3)(i) for purposes of \n\u00a7 263A, and are capitalizable into the bases of the Project\u2019s residential rental \nbuildings, using a reasonable method of allocation under \u00a7 1.263A-1(f) to allocate \nthe costs among the residential rental buildings.\n3.  The costs incurred by A to construct the Infrastructure Improvements \nare includable in the eligible basis of a qualified low-income building under \n\u00a7 42(d)(1).\nLAW AND ANALYSIS\nIssue 1\nSection 263(a) provides that no deduction is allowed for any amount paid \nout for new buildings or for permanent improvements or betterments made to \nincrease the value of any new property or estate.\nSection 1.263(a)-2(a) provides that capital expenditures include the cost of \nacquisition, construction, or erection of buildings, machinery and equipment, \nfurniture, and similar property have a useful life substantially beyond the taxable \nyear.\nSection 1.263(a)-4(d)(8)(i) generally provides that a taxpayer must \ncapitalize amounts paid for real property if the taxpayer transfers ownership of \nthe real property to another person (except to the extent the real property is sold \nfor fair market value) and if the real property can reasonably be expected to \nproduce significant economic benefits to the taxpayer after the transfer.  A \nPLR-130318-08\n5\ntaxpayer also must capitalize amounts paid to produce or improve real property \nowned by another (except to the extent the taxpayer is selling services at fair \nmarket value to produce or improve the real property) if the real property can \nreasonably be expected to produce significant economic benefits for the \ntaxpayer. \nSection 1.263(a)-4(d)(8)(iv) provides, in part, that  \u00a7 1.263(a)-4(d)(8)(i) \ndoes not apply to amounts paid for real property or improvements to real property \nconstructed by the taxpayer where the real property or improvements benefit new \ndevelopment or expansion of existing development, are immediately transferred \nto a state or local government for dedication to the general public use, and are \nmaintained by the state or local government (\u201cdedicated improvements\u201d).\nExample (3) of \u00a7 1.263(a)-4(d)(8)(v) illustrates the above rules with \nrespect to dedicated improvements as follows: X corporation is engaged in the \ndevelopment and sale of residential real estate.  In connection with a residential \nreal estate project under construction by X in city Z, X is required by city Z to \nconstruct ingress and egress roads to and from its project and immediately \ntransfer the roads to city Z for dedication to general public use.  The roads will be \nmaintained by city Z.  X pays its subcontractor $100,000 to construct the ingress \nand egress roads.  X's payment is a dedicated improvement within the meaning \nof \u00a7 1.263(a)-4(d)(8)(iv).  Accordingly, X is not required to capitalize the $100,000 \npayment under \u00a7 1.263(a)-4(d)(8).  See \u00a7 263A and the regulations thereunder \nfor capitalization rules that apply to amounts referred to in \u00a7 1.263(a)-4(d)(8)(iv).\nHere, A is engaged in the construction and operation of the Project and is \nrequired by City to construct the Infrastructure Improvements and to dedicate \nthem to the use of the public.  By providing residents of the residential rental \nbuildings access to the existing streets and infrastructure, the Infrastructure \nImprovements benefit the Project.  By recording the City-approved plat of the \nproperty, A immediately delineates and places in the public record those portions \nof the land belonging to City on which A will construct the Infrastructure \nImprovements.  The dedication is accepted by City upon completion of the \nInfrastructure Improvements and, consequently, such improvements are \nimmediately transferred to City.  The Infrastructure improvements will be \nmaintained by City.  Thus, the Infrastructure Improvements are dedicated \nimprovements within the meaning of \u00a7 1.263(a)-4(d)(8)(iv) and, therefore, the \ncosts incurred by A to construct the Infrastructure Improvements are not \ncapitalizable as amounts paid to create an intangible.\nIssue 2 \nSection 263A provides, in part, that direct costs and a properly allocable \nportion of indirect costs of real or tangible personal property produced by a \ntaxpayer must be capitalized to the property produced.  See also \u00a7 1.263A-\n1(a)(3)(ii).  \nPLR-130318-08\n6\nSection 263A(g)(1) provides that the term \"produce\" includes construct, \nbuild, install, manufacture, develop, or improve.  See also \u00a7 1.263A-2(a)(1)(i).  \nProperty produced may include land, buildings, land improvements, and other\ntangible property owned by the taxpayer for federal income tax purposes.  \nSee \u00a7 1.263A-2(a)(1)(ii).  \nSection 1.263A-1(c)(1) provides that to determine these capitalizable \ncosts, taxpayers must allocate or apportion costs to various activities, including \nproduction activities.  After \u00a7 263A costs are allocated to the appropriate \nproduction activities, these costs generally are allocated to the items of property \nproduced during the taxable year and capitalized to the items that remain on \nhand at the end of the taxable year.  \nSection 1.263A-1(e) provides rules for determining the direct and indirect \ncosts that are required to be capitalized to property produced.  Section 1.263A-\n1(e)(2)(i) provides that direct costs consist of direct material and direct labor.\nSection 1.263A-1(e)(3)(i) defines indirect costs as all costs other than \ndirect material costs and direct labor costs.  Indirect costs are properly allocable \nto property produced when the costs directly benefit, or are incurred by reason \nof, the performance of production activities.  Indirect costs that are allocable to \nproduction activities then must be allocated among the properties produced.  \nSee \u00a7 1.263A-1(f).\nSection 1.263A-1(f) sets forth various detailed or specific (facts-and-\ncircumstances) cost allocation methods that taxpayers may use to allocate direct \nand indirect costs to property produced and property acquired for resale.  Section \n1.263A-1(f)(2) describes a specific identification method as a type of facts and \ncircumstances method that traces costs to a cost objective, such as a function, \ndepartment, activity, or product, on the basis of a cause and effect or other \nreasonable relationship between the costs and the cost objective.\nIn Von-Lusk v. Commissioner, 104 T.C. 207 (1995), the Tax Court held \nthat the cost of obtaining building permits and zoning variances, negotiating \npermit fees, and similar activities, incurred by a real estate developer before \nactual physical work began on undeveloped land are indirect costs capitalizable \nunder \u00a7 263A. The court found that these activities represent the \u201cfirst steps in \nthe development of the property.\u201d  The court further noted that the pursuit of \nbuilding permits and zoning variances, negotiating permit fees, and similar \nactivities \u201care ancillary to actual physical work on the land and are as much a part \nof a development project as digging a foundation or completing a structure's \nframe.  The project cannot move forward if these steps are not taken.\u201d\nIn Revenue Ruling 2002-9, 2002-1 C.B. 614, a taxpayer constructed a \nnew residential rental building on unimproved land located in a county that \nPLR-130318-08\n7\nimposed impact fees on new and expanded development.  The ruling found that \nbecause the impact fees directly benefited, or were incurred by reason of, the \ntaxpayer's production activity, the impact fees were indirect costs required to be \ncapitalizable under \u00a7 263A.  In addition, because (1) the impact fees were \nassessed as a result of the taxpayer's plans to construct the building, (2) the \namount of the impact fees was calculated based upon the characteristics of the \nbuilding, and (3) the impact fees generally would be refundable if the taxpayer \ndecided not to construct the building as planned, the impact fees were allocable \nto the new residential rental building under \u00a7 263A.\nIn the instant case, as the developer of the Project, A is a producer of real \nor tangible personal property and, consequently, is subject to \u00a7 263A.  Therefore, \nA must capitalize the direct costs and a properly allocable portion of indirect \ncosts to property produced in the Project development.  To determine which \ncosts are capitalizable, taxpayers must first allocate or apportion costs to their \nvarious activities, including their production activities.  Sections 1.263A-1(c)(1) \nand 1.263A-1(e)(3)(i).  Here, A is engaged in both the construction and operation \nof the Project.  Clearly, the costs of constructing the Infrastructure Improvements \nare a part of the construction of the Project.  Thus, the costs of constructing the \nInfrastructure Improvements are allocable to A\u2019s construction activities. \nAfter costs are allocated to an appropriate production activity, the costs \ngenerally are allocated to the items of property produced during the taxable year.  \nSection 1.263A-1(c)(1).  Although the Infrastructure Improvements are, in \nthemselves, real or tangible personal property produced by A, A is required to \ntransfer them to City, for the use of the public, in order for A to obtain the \nrequisite certificates of occupancy (in lieu of building permits) for the Project.  \nThus, like the costs at issue in Von-Lusk and the impact fees in Rev. Rul. 2002-9, \nthe costs directly benefit, or are incurred by reason of, the construction of the \nProject.  Therefore, the costs are indirect costs as defined in \u00a7 1.263A-1(e)(3)(i), \nand are capitalizable to the property produced in the Project.\nSection 1.263A-1(f) discusses various detailed or specific (facts and \ncircumstances) methods that can be used to allocate indirect costs to the items \nof produced property.  A specific identification method traces costs to a cost \nobjective, such as a function, department, activity, or product, on the basis of a \ncause and effect or other reasonable relationship between the costs and the cost \nobjective.  Section 1.263A-1(f)(2).  In Rev. Rul. 2002-9, because the impact fees \nwere assessed as a result of the taxpayer's plans to construct the building, the \namount of the fees was calculated based on the characteristics of the building, \nand the impact fees were generally refundable if the building was not constructed \nas planned, the impact fees were allocable only to the basis of the new \nresidential rental building.  Thus, because of those factors, a cause and effect or \nother reasonable relationship existed between the impact fees and the residential \nrental building.\nPLR-130318-08\n8\nHere, the Infrastructure Improvements are necessary to provide the \nresidents of the Project\u2019s residential rental buildings access to the existing streets \nand infrastructure of City.  City requires A to construct those improvements and \nto dedicate them for the public use as a condition for issuing the certificates of \noccupancy (in lieu of building permits) for the Project's residential rental \nbuildings.  The scope (i.e., the type and size) of the Infrastructure Improvements \nare determined by the characteristics of the Project\u2019s residential rental buildings.  \nFor example, City approved the dimensions of the streets that A will dedicate to \nCity based on the residential use of the buildings.  In addition, City will modify the \nscope of the Infrastructure Improvements if the number of residential rental \nbuildings is increased or decreased.  Because of these factors, a cause and \neffect or other reasonable relationship exists between the costs incurred for the \nInfrastructure Improvements and the Project\u2019s residential rental buildings.  \nConversely, the Ancillary Improvements have no material effect on the \nrequirement to construct, or the scope of, the Infrastructure Improvements and, \ntherefore, there is no cause and effect or other reasonable relationship between \nthe Ancillary Improvements and the costs incurred to construct the Infrastructure \nImprovements.  Thus, under a specific identification method as described in \n\u00a7 1.263A-1(f), the costs incurred by A to construct the Infrastructure \nImprovements, like the impact fees in Rev. Rul. 2002-9, are properly allocable \nonly to, and among, the Project\u2019s residential rental buildings.\nIssue 3\nSection 42(a) provides that the amount of the low-income housing tax \ncredit determined for any taxable year in the credit period is an amount equal to \nthe applicable percentage of the qualified basis of each low-income building.\nSection 42(c)(1)(A) defines the qualified basis of any qualified low-income \nbuilding for any taxable year as an amount equal to the applicable fraction, \ndetermined as of the close of the taxable year, of the eligible basis of the \nbuilding, determined under \u00a7 42(d)(5).\nSection 42(c)(2) provides that the term \"qualified low-income building\" \nmeans, in part, any building to which the amendments made by section 201(a) of \nthe Tax Reform Act of 1986 apply (the 1986 Act).  Section 201(a) of the 1986 Act \nmodified property subject to the accelerated cost recovery system (ACRS) under \n\u00a7 168 for property placed in service after December 31, 1986, except for property \ncovered by transition rules.\nSection 42(d)(1) provides that the eligible basis of a new building is its \nadjusted basis as of the close of the first tax year of the credit period.  Section \n42(d)(4)(A) provides that, except as provided in \u00a7 42(d)(4)(B), the adjusted basis \nof any building is determined without regard to the adjusted basis of any property \nthat is not residential rental property.  Section 42(d)(4)(B) provides that the \nadjusted basis of any building includes the adjusted basis of property (of a \nPLR-130318-08\n9\ncharacter subject to the allowance for depreciation) used in common areas or \nprovided as comparable amenities to all residential rental units in the building.\nThe legislative history of \u00a7 42 states that for purposes of the low-income \nhousing credit, residential rental property has the same meaning as residential \nrental property within \u00a7 103.  The legislative history of \u00a7 42 further states that \nresidential rental property thus includes residential rental units, facilities for use \nby the tenants, and other facilities reasonably required by the project.  2 H.R. \nConf. Rep. No. 841, 99th Cong., 2d Sess. 11-89 (1986), 1986-3 (Vol. 4) C.B. 89.  \nUnder \u00a71.103-8(b)(4) of the Income Tax Regulations, facilities that are \nfunctionally related and subordinate to residential rental units are considered \nresidential rental property.  Section 1.103- 8(b)(4)(iii) provides that facilities that \nare functionally related and subordinate to residential rental units include facilities \nfor use by the tenants, such as swimming pools and similar recreational facilities, \nparking areas, and other facilities reasonably required for the project.  The \nexamples given by \u00a7 1.103-8(b)(4)(iii) of facilities reasonably required for a \nproject specifically include units for resident managers or maintenance \npersonnel.  \nBased on the above, the eligible basis of a low-income housing building \nunder \u00a7 42(d)(1) includes (1) the adjusted basis of depreciable property subject \nto \u00a7 168 that qualifies as residential rental property under \u00a7 103, and (2) the \nadjusted basis of depreciable property subject to \u00a7 168 that is used in a common \narea or provided as a comparable amenity to all residential rental units in the \nbuilding.\nBecause the Infrastructure Improvements are dedicated improvements \nwithin the meaning of \u00a7 1.263(a)-4(d)(8)(iv), the cost of which are indirect costs \ncapitalized under \u00a7 263A into the basis of the Project\u2019s residential rental \nbuildings, and because A represents that it intends to construct and operate the \nProject\u2019s residential rental buildings to qualify the Project\u2019s residential rental \nbuildings for the low-income housing tax credit under \u00a7 42 (thus, implying that the \nproject buildings will be depreciated as residential rental property under \u00a7 168), \nthe cost of the Infrastructure Improvements will be includable in the eligible basis \nof the Project\u2019s residential rental buildings under \u00a7 42(d)(1).\nBased solely on the facts and representations provided, and the relevant \nlaw and analysis set forth above, we conclude that:\n1. The costs incurred by A to construct the Infrastructure Improvements \nfor the Project are dedicated improvements for purposes of \u00a7 263(a) and  \n\u00a7 1.263(a)-4(d)(8)(iv) and, therefore, are not capitalizable as amounts paid to \ncreate an intangible under \u00a7 1.263(a)-4(d)(8)(i);\n2. The costs incurred by A to construct the Infrastructure Improvements \nfor the Project are indirect costs, within the meaning of \u00a7 1.263A-1(e)(3)(i) for \nPLR-130318-08\n10\npurposes of \u00a7 263A, and are capitalizable into the bases of the Project\u2019s \nresidential rental buildings, using a reasonable method of allocation under \n\u00a7 1.263A-1(f) to allocate the costs among the residential rental buildings.\n3. Assuming that Project\u2019s residential rental buildings will be depreciated \nas residential rental property under \u00a7 168, the eligible basis of the Project\u2019s \nresidential rental buildings under \u00a7 42(d)(1) includes the cost of the Infrastructure\nImprovements.\nWe note that the costs incurred by A for the Infrastructure Improvements \nmust be depreciated under \u00a7 168 as residential rental property or nonresidential \nreal property (as defined in \u00a7 168(e)(2)), as applicable, beginning when each \nresidential rental building in the Project is placed in service by A.\nExcept as specifically set forth above, we express no opinion regarding \nthe application of any other provisions of the Code or Income Tax Regulations.  \nSpecifically, no opinion is expressed or implied on whether the Project\u2019s \nresidential rental buildings are depreciated as residential rental property under \n\u00a7 168 or whether each of the Project\u2019s residential rental buildings is a qualified \nlow-income building under \u00a7 42.\nThis ruling is directed only to the taxpayer that requested it.  Section \n6110(k)(3) provides that it may not be used or cited as precedent.\nIn accordance with the provisions of a power of attorney on file with this \noffice, we are sending copies of this letter ruling to A\u2019s authorized \nrepresentatives.  We are also sending a copy of this letter to the appropriate \ndivision director.\nSincerely,\nKathleen Reed \nChief, Branch 7\nOffice of Associate Chief Counsel\n(Income Tax & Accounting)\nEnclosures:\nCopy of this letter\nCopy for Section 6110 purposes\ncc:\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Non-Adverse"}]}

A ruling under section 280G concerning\nwhether the base period includes any period during which a disqualified individual\nserved as an outside director was withdrawn.  The facts, as submitted, are set forth\nbelow.\nCompany was formed for the sole purpose of acquiring the stock of Target.  On\nDate A, Acquiring and Company entered into an acquisition agreement (Merger\nAgreement) to purchase all of the issued and outstanding stock of Target. \nSubsequently, Parent commenced an offer to purchase all of the shares of Target.  On\nDate B, Target became a wholly owned subsidiary of Acquiring.  The merger was\nstructured to be tax free at the corporate level, however, the purchase of shares was\ntaxable to Target shareholders.\nParent represents that Target will not be required to file any reports or\n2\nPLR-106935-00\nstatements with the SEC that disclose executive compensation and that would be due\nafter Target ceased to be a reporting entity as a result of the merger.  Accordingly, there\nwill be no \u201cSummary Compensation Table\u201d for Target which would disclose the\ncompensation of the chief executive officer and four highest paid officers for Target\u2019s\nyear that ended with the merger the day prior to Date B (Acquisition Year).\nParent represents that none of the former Target employees will be included in\nthe Year C Summary Compensation Table to be filed by Parent with the SEC.  Many\nTarget executives will continue to be Target employees, but some may become\nAcquiring employees or employees of other affiliated corporations during Year C or the\nfollowing year.\nCertain corporate officers of Target and Parent resigned in Year C or may resign\nin a later year as employees; others may resign their positions as officers and all of their\nduties as officers in a year (Resignation Year).  Those individuals who resign their\npositions as officers may continue to perform services as consultants or as Target or\nParent employees or employees of another company in the Parent controlled group for\nthe remainder of the Resignation Year and possibly in future years.   Thus, resignation\nfrom their positions as officers does not necessarily equate to resignation from service\nas consultants or employees.  These officers may be listed pursuant to the executive\ncompensation disclosure rules under the Exchange Act as chief executive officer or one\nof the highest compensated officers for the Resignation Year.\nSection 162(a)(1) of the Code allows a deduction for all of the ordinary and\nnecessary expenses paid or incurred during the taxable year in carrying on any trade or\nbusiness, including a reasonable allowance for salaries or other compensation for\npersonal services actually rendered.\nSection 162(m)(1) of the Code provides that for any publicly held corporation, no\ndeduction shall be allowed for applicable employee remuneration with respect to any\ncovered employee to the extent that the amount of such remuneration for the taxable\nyear exceeds $1,000,000.\nSection 162(m)(3) of the Code defines \u201ccovered employee\u201d as any employee of\nthe corporation if, as of the close of the taxable year, such employee is the chief\nexecutive officer of the taxpayer or is an individual acting in such capacity, or the total\ncompensation of such employee for the taxable year is required to be reported to\nshareholders under the Exchange Act by reason of such employee being among the\nfour highest compensated officers for the taxable year (other than the chief executive\nofficer).\nSection 1.162-27(c)(2) of the Income Tax Regulations provides the general rule\ndescribing who is a \u201ccovered employee.\u201d  Under the regulations, a covered employee\nmeans any individual who, on the last day of the taxable year, is (A) the chief executive\n3\nPLR-106935-00\nofficer of the corporation or is acting in such capacity; or (B) among the four highest\ncompensated officers (other than the chief executive officer).  Whether an individual is\nthe chief executive officer or one of the four highest compensated officers is determined\npursuant to the executive compensation disclosure rules under the Exchange Act.\nIn the notice of proposed rulemaking containing the proposed regulations under\nsection 162(m) of the Code, the preamble contains the following language concerning\nthe identification of \u201ccovered employee\u201d:\nThe regulations clarify which employees are \u201ccovered employees\u201d for\npurposes of section 162(m).  The legislative history to section 162(m)\nprovides that \u201ccovered employees\u201d are defined by reference to the SEC\nrules governing executive compensation disclosure under the Exchange\nAct.  Under the regulations, an individual generally is a \u201ccovered\nemployee\u201d if the individual\u2019s compensation is reported on the \u201csummary\ncompensation table\u201d under the SEC\u2019s executive compensation disclosure\nrules, as set forth in Item 402 of Regulations S-K, 17 C.F.R. 229.402,\nunder the Exchange Act.  However, the regulations specifically provide\nthat, in order to be a \u201ccovered employee\u201d for section 162(m) purposes, an\nindividual must be employed as an executive officer on the last day of the\ntaxable year.  Thus, only those employees who appear on the \u201csummary\ncompensation table\u201d and who are also employed on the last day of the\ntaxable year are \u201ccovered employees.\u201d\n \nAccordingly, based on the facts as submitted, we rule as follows:\n1.\nFor purposes of section 162(m) of the Code, Target\u2019s officers will not be\n\u201ccovered employees\u201d with respect to the Acquisition Year because no Summary\nCompensation Table is required to be filed by Target with the SEC for the\nAcquisition Year and these officers will not be listed on any Summary\nCompensation Table filed by Parent for the Acquisition Year.\n2.\nFor purposes of section 162(m) of the Code, officers of Target and Acquiring will\nnot be \u201ccovered employees\u201d with respect to the Resignation Year, if they have\nresigned their employment or their positions as officers before the last day of the\nResignation Year with no intent to resume their duties as officers in the\nforseeable future.  Accordingly, no compensation paid to these officers with\nrespect to the Resignation Year will be subject to the 162(m) deduction limitation.\nAlthough you requested a ruling concerning whether the base period under\nsection 280G(d)(1) of the Code includes the period during which a disqualified\nindividual served as an outside director, the ruling was withdrawn.  Except as\nspecifically ruled on above, no opinion is expressed as to the federal income tax\nconsequences of the above-described transaction under any other provisions of the\n4\nPLR-106935-00\nCode.\nThis ruling is directed only to the taxpayer(s) requesting it.

There is no plan or intent to revoke or otherwise terminate \nthe S corporation election of either Distributing or Controlled.\n \nRULINGS\nBased solely on information submitted and the representations set forth, we rule as \nfollows:   \n(1) The transfer of the Business 2 assets by Distributing to Controlled in exchange \nfor all the stock in Controlled and the assumption by Controlled of liabilities \nassociated with the assets transferred, followed by the distribution of all the \nControlled stock to shareholders A and B constitutes a reorganization within \nthe meaning of section 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code.  Distributing and Controlled \neach will be \u201ca party to a reorganization\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 368(b).     \n(2) No gain or loss will be recognized by Distributing upon the transfer of assets \nPLR-135700-08\n6\nto Controlled in exchange for Controlled stock and the assumption by\nControlled of liabilities of Distributing in the Contribution.  Sections 361(a) and\n357(a).    \n(3) Controlled will recognize no gain or loss on the receipt of Distributing\u2019s assets \nsubject to liabilities, in exchange for the common stock of Controlled.  Section \n1032(a)\n(4)  The basis of each asset received by Controlled from Distributing will be equal \nto the basis of such asset in the hands of Distributing immediately prior to its  \ntransfer.   Section 362(b).\n(5)  The holding period for each asset received by Controlled from Distributing will \ninclude the period during which Distributing held the asset.  Section 1223(2). \n(6)   No gain or loss will be recognized by Distributing on the distribution of the \nstock of Controlled to Shareholder A and Shareholder B.  Section 361(c).\n(7)   No gain or loss will be recognized by (and no amount will otherwise be \nincluded in the income of) Shareholder A and Shareholder B upon their receipt      \nof Controlled stock from Distributing.  Section 355(a)(1).\n(8)  The aggregate basis of Controlled and Distributing stock in the hands of \nShareholder A and Shareholder B immediately after the distribution will be the\n \nsame as the basis of the Distributing stock in the hands of Shareholder A and \nShareholder B immediately prior to the distribution allocated between                          \nDistributing stock and Controlled stock in proportion to the relative fair market   \nvalue of each.  Section 358(a)(1)(b) and (c); Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.358-1(a), \n1.358-2(a)(2).\n(9) The holding period of Controlled stock received by Shareholder A and \nShareholder B will include the holding period of the Distributing stock with \nrespect to which the distribution was made, provided the Distributing stock is a \ncapital asset on the date of distribution.  Section 1223(1). \n(10) Proper allocation of Distributing\u2019s earnings and profits will be made under \u00a7\u00a7   \n312(h) and 1.312-10(a).    \n(11) Distributing\u2019s accumulated adjustments account immediately before the \ntransaction will be allocated among Distributing and Controlled in a manner  \nsimilar to the manner in which Distributing\u2019s earnings and profits will be \nallocated under \u00a7\u00a7 312(h) (see \u00a7\u00a71.312-10(a) and 1.1368-2(d)(3)). \n(12)  Distributing\u2019s momentary ownership of the stock of Controlled, as part of the \n \nreorganization under \u00a7 368(a)(1)(D), will not cause Controlled to have an\nPLR-135700-08\n7\nineligible shareholder for any portion of its first taxable year under    \n\u00a71361(b)(1)(B).  If Controlled otherwise meets the requirements of a small     \n \nbusiness corporation under \u00a71361, Controlled will be eligible to elect to be a    \nsubchapter S corporation under \u00a71362(a) for its first taxable year.\n(13)        Controlled will be subject to \u00a7 1374 with respect to any asset transferred to\nControlled to the same extent Distributing was subject to \u00a7 1374 with respect to \nsuch asset.  For purposes of \u00a7 1374, the recognition period for Controlled will \nbe reduced by the portion of Distributing\u2019s recognition period that expired prior \nto the transfer of these assets to Controlled (\u00a7 1374(d)(8) and Ann. 86-128,    \n1986-51 I.R.B. 22).\nCAVEATS\nWe express no opinion about the tax treatment of the Proposed Transaction under other \nprovisions of the Code and regulations or the tax treatment of any condition existing at the \ntime of, or effects resulting from, the Proposed Transaction that are not specifically \ncovered by the above rulings.  In particular, no opinion is expressed regarding: (i) \nWhether the Distribution satisfies the business purpose requirement of Treas. Reg. \u00a7 \n1.355-2(b); (ii) Whether the Distribution is being used principally as a device for the \ndistribution of earnings and profits of Distributing or Controlled. (see section 355(a)(1)(B) \nand Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.355-2(d)); and (iii) Whether the Distribution is part of a plan (or series \nof related transactions) pursuant to which one ore more persons will acquire directly or \nindirectly stock representing a 50-percent or greater interest in Distributing or Controlled \n(see section 355(e) and Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.355-7).\nPROCEDURAL STATEMENT\nThis ruling letter is directed only to the taxpayer who requested it.

Reg. \u00a7\u00a7 301.9100-1 and 301.9100-3 to file Form 4876-A (\u201cElection To \nBe Treated as an Interest Charge DISC\u201d) for Taxpayer\u2019s first taxable year.  \nThe rulings contained in this letter are based upon information and representations \nsubmitted by Taxpayer and Accounting Firm and accompanied by penalty of perjury \nstatements executed by appropriate parties.  This office has not verified any of the \nmaterial submitted in support of the request for rulings.  It is subject to verification on \nexamination.  \nPLR-110072-13\n2\nFACTS\nTaxpayer is a domestic corporation wholly owned by Company.  Taxpayer was formed \nto serve as an interest charge domestic international sales corporation (\u201cIC-DISC\u201d) and \nhas established a commission arrangement with Company.  Law Firm prepared the\narticles of incorporation.  Taxpayer was formed on Date 1 in State.  \nTaxpayer engaged Accounting Firm, which specializes in consulting on IC-DISC \ntaxation, on Date 2.  On the same day, Accounting Firm advised Taxpayer that it did not \nmeet the capitalization requirements to qualify as an IC-DISC.  According to Taxpayer\u2019s \noriginal submission, the two individuals who served as the only board members of both \nTaxpayer and Company had \u201coffered to subscribe to 1,000 shares of [Taxpayer\u2019s] stock \nin exchange for $1000.00 cash.\u201d  Those individuals are not the shareholders of \nTaxpayer,1 and Taxpayer has not established that any stock was issued by Taxpayer \nwith respect to such proposed subscription.  According to a subsequent submission2 by \nTaxpayer dated August 14, 2013 (based on information provided by Law Firm), \nCompany had issued a promissory note in the amount of $2500 to Taxpayer on Date 3 \nin exchange for stock.  Based on the limited record before us, it is unclear whether \nTaxpayer had any outstanding stock during the relevant time period, and it is also \nunclear what the value of any such stock may have been.\nAfter obtaining Taxpayer\u2019s EIN, Accounting Firm delivered the completed IRS Form \n4876-A to Taxpayer on Date 4 and erroneously advised Taxpayer the election had to be \nfiled by Date 5, one day after the actual due date.  Taxpayer filed the election on Date 5 \nand received a notice of rejection from the Service on Date 6. \nTaxpayer has requested a ruling that grants an extension of time of 60 days from the \ndate of the ruling letter to file Form 4876-A and that such filing will be treated as a timely \nelection to be treated as an IC-DISC for Taxpayer\u2019s first taxable year.  \nLAW AND ANALYSIS\nSection 992(b)(1)(A) provides that an election by a corporation to be treated as a DISC3\nshall be made by such corporation for a taxable year at any time during the 90-day \nperiod immediately preceding the beginning of the taxable year, except that the \nSecretary may give his consent to the making of an election at such other times as he \nmay designate.\n                                           \n1 Taxpayer also asserts that the original articles of incorporation identified the two individuals as the \nshareholders of Taxpayer, but that the articles were amended shortly thereafter to identify Company as \nthe sole shareholder of Taxpayer.  In addition, while the original articles of incorporation specified a share \npar value of $0, the amended articles specified a par value of $1.\n2 The subsequent submission was not accompanied by a penalty of perjury statement.\n3 As used in this letter, the terms \u201cIC-DISC\u201d and \u201cDISC\u201d have the same meaning.\nPLR-110072-13\n3\nTemp. Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.921-1T(b)(1) provides, in part, that a corporation electing IC-\nDISC status must file Form 4876-A.  A corporation electing to be treated as an IC-DISC \nfor its first taxable year shall make its election within 90 days after the beginning of that \nyear.\nSection 992(b)(1)(C) provides that the term \u201cDISC\u201d means, with respect to any taxable \nyear, a corporation that is incorporated under the laws of any state and satisfies a \nnumber of conditions, including that such corporation does not have more than one \nclass of stock, and that the par or stated value of its outstanding stock is at least $2500 \non each day of the taxable year.  \nTreas. Reg. \u00a7 1.992-1(d)(1) provides that, in the case of a corporation that has elected \nto be treated as a DISC for its first taxable year, the capitalization requirement of section \n992(b)(1)(C) is satisfied if the par value (or, in the case of stock without par value, the \nstated value) of the corporation\u2019s outstanding stock is at least $2,500 on the last day of \nthe period within which the election must be made and on each succeeding day of the \nyear.  \nTreas. Reg. \u00a7 301.9100-1(c) provides, in part, that the Commissioner, in exercising the \nCommissioner's discretion, may grant a reasonable extension of time under the rules \nset forth in Treas. Reg. \u00a7\u00a7 301.9100-2 and 301.9100-3 to make a regulatory election \nunder all subtitles of the Code except subtitles E, G, H, and I.\nTreas. Reg. \u00a7 301.9100-1(b) provides that a regulatory election is an election whose \ndue date is prescribed by a regulation published in the Federal Register, or a revenue \nruling, revenue procedure, notice, or announcement published in the Internal Revenue \nBulletin.  For this purpose, an election includes an application for relief in respect of tax.\nTreas. Reg. \u00a7 301.9100-3(a) provides that requests for extensions of time for regulatory \nelections that do not meet the requirements of Treas. Reg. \u00a7 301.9100-2 (automatic \nextensions) must be made under the rules of Treas. Reg. \u00a7 301.9100-3.  Requests for \nrelief subject to Treas. Reg. \u00a7 301.9100-3 will be granted when the taxpayer provides \nthe evidence (including affidavits described in Treas. Reg. \u00a7 301.9100-3(e)) to establish \nto the satisfaction of the Commissioner that the taxpayer acted reasonably and in good \nfaith, and that the grant of relief will not prejudice the interests of the Government.\nBased on the facts and representations submitted with Taxpayer\u2019s ruling request, we \nconclude that Taxpayer satisfies Treas. Reg. \u00a7 301.9100-3(a).  Accordingly, Taxpayer is \ngranted an extension of time of 60 days from the date of this ruling letter to file Form \n4876-A.  Such filing will be treated as a timely election to be treated as an IC-DISC for \nTaxpayer's first taxable year.  \nThe granting of an extension in this ruling letter is not a determination that Taxpayer is \nPLR-110072-13\n4\notherwise eligible to make the election or to claim IC-DISC status or benefits.  See\nTreas. Reg. \u00a7 301.9100-1(a).  In particular, Taxpayer may still fail to qualify as an IC-\nDISC for one or more years for failure to meet the capitalization requirement under \nsection 992(b)(1)(C) and Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.992-1(d)(1).  However, we do not attempt to \nanswer that question in this ruling.\nA copy of this letter ruling should be filed with the Form 4876-A.\nThis ruling is directed only to the taxpayer that requested it.  Section 6110(k)(3) of the \nCode provides that written determinations may not be used or cited as precedent. \nExcept as expressly provided herein, this ruling neither expresses nor implies any \nopinion concerning the tax consequences of any aspect of any transaction or item \ndiscussed or referenced in this ruling letter.\nPursuant to a Power of Attorney on file in this office, copies of this ruling letter are being \nfurnished to your authorized representatives.\nSincerely,\n___________________________\nChristopher J.

Although this office has not verified any of\nthe material submitted in support of the request for a ruling, it is subject to verification\non examination.\nThe Taxpayer is a reinsurance company that was organized in Ireland on Date\nB.  It is a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent, a             reinsurance company.  Holding\nCompany, also a             company, is the beneficial owner of                 of the stock of\nParent.\nSection 4371 imposes an excise tax on premiums paid on insurance policies\nissued to U.S. persons and covering risks wholly or partly within the United States, and\nto foreign persons engaged in a U.S. trade or business and covering risks within the\nUnited States.  See \u00a7 4372(d).  Rev. Proc. 92-39, 1992-1 C.B. 860, establishes\nprocedures for entering into a closing agreement to establish an exemption from the\n \u00a7 4371 excise tax when the exemption is claimed under a U.S. income tax treaty.\nPLR-167036-01\nArticle 7(1)(Business Profits) of the Treaty provides as follows:\nThe profits of an enterprise of a Contracting State shall be taxable\nonly in that State unless the enterprise carries on business in the other\nContracting State through a permanent establishment situated therein.\nArticle 2(1)(a)(Taxes Covered) includes the \u00a7 4371 excise tax within the scope of\nthe Treaty, but contains the following limitation:\nThe Convention shall, however, apply to the Federal excise taxes\nimposed on insurance premiums paid to foreign insurers only to the extent\nthat the risks covered by such premiums are not reinsured with a person\nnot entitled to the benefits of this or any other convention which provides\nexemption from these taxes.\nParagraph 2 of the Protocol to the Treaty requires that an Irish insurance\ncompany be subject to the generally applicable Irish tax on such companies, as follows:\nFor the purposes of paragraph 1, it is understood that this\nConvention shall not apply to the Federal Excise Taxes imposed on\ninsurance premiums paid to foreign insurers where such premiums are\nnot subject to the generally applicable tax imposed on insurance\ncorporations in the Contracting State in which such insurers are resident.\nThe limitation on benefits provision in Article 23 of the Treaty sets forth several\nalternative safe harbors for claiming benefits under the Treaty.  Article 23(3)(a) provides\nthat a person who is not a \u201cqualified person\u201d under paragraph (2) of Article 23\nnevertheless may qualify for benefits under the Treaty with respect to an item of income\nderived from the other State, if:\ni) such resident is engaged in the active conduct of a\ntrade or business in the first-mentioned State (other than the\nbusiness of making or managing investments, unless such\nbusiness is carried out by a bank or insurance company\nacting in the ordinary course of its business), and\nii) the item of income is connected with or incidental\nto the trade or business in the first-mentioned State,\nprovided that, where such item is connected with a trade or\nbusiness in the first-mentioned State and such resident has\nan ownership interest in the activity in the other State that\ngenerated the income, the trade or business is substantial in\nrelation to that activity.\nParagraph 9(b)(i)(B) of the Protocol to the Treaty states that\nPLR-167036-01\nan insurance company will be considered to be engaged in the\nactive conduct of a trade or business if its gross income consists primarily\nof insurance or reinsurance premiums and investment income attributable\nto such premiums.\nArticle 23(3)(b)(i) of the Treaty provides that an item of income is connected with\na trade or business\nif the activity in the other State that generated the item of income is a line\nof business that forms a part of or is complementary to the trade or\nbusiness conducted in the first-mentioned State by the income recipient.\nThe Taxpayer represents that it is a resident of Ireland and is subject to the\ngenerally applicable Irish tax imposed on Irish insurance companies.  The Taxpayer\nstates that all of its income will consist of insurance and reinsurance premiums and\ninvestment earnings attributable to such premiums.  The premium income it expects to\nreceive from U.S. insureds is derived in connection with, or is incidental to, its trade or\nbusiness in Ireland, according to the Taxpayer.  Based on these representations, we\nconclude that the Taxpayer satisfies the active trade or business test of Article 23(3)\nand is eligible for benefits under the Treaty.\nAccording to paragraph (8)(a) of the Closing Agreement, the liability of the\nTaxpayer for federal excise tax, as agreed upon, including liability resulting from\nreinsurance of U.S. risks with persons not entitled to exemption under the Treaty or\nanother convention, will commence on Date A, the date specified by the Taxpayer.  The\nletter of credit required by paragraph (5)(a) of the Closing Agreement, in the amount of\n$75,000, must be in effect within 30 days of the date the agreement is signed on behalf\nof the Commissioner.\nAny person otherwise required to remit the federal excise tax on foreign\ninsurance or reinsurance policies issued by the Taxpayer pursuant to \u00a7 46.4374-1(a) of\nthe excise tax regulations may rely upon a copy of this letter or an executed copy of the\nClosing Agreement as authority that they may consider premiums paid to the Taxpayer\non and after Date A, as exempt under the Treaty from the federal excise tax.\nExcept as expressly provided herein, no opinion is expressed or implied\nconcerning the tax consequences of any aspect of any transaction or item discussed or\nreferenced in this letter.  This ruling does not address the issues of whether the\nTaxpayer is an insurance company or whether premiums paid to the Taxpayer are\ndeductible under \u00a7162 of the Code.\nThis ruling is directed only to the taxpayer requesting it.  Section 6110(k)(3) of\nthe Code provides that it may not be used or cited as precedent.\nPLR-167036-01\nIn accordance with the power of attorney on file with this office, a copy of this\nletter is being sent to the Taxpayer\u2019s representative.\nSincerely yours,\n____________________\n                                        \nSenior Technical Reviewer, Branch 1\nOffice of Associate Chief Counsel\n   (International)\n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                                                   \n                               \n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Non-Adverse"}]}

Specifically, you requested a ruling that certain contributions to \nPlan are not income to City employees at the time of contribution under section 61 of \nthe Internal Revenue Code (Code), and are not wages subject to employment taxes \nunder sections 3121 and 3402 of the Code.  \nCity contributes amounts to Plan to provide retirement benefits for eligible employees of \nCity.  Plan is a governmental plan as defined in section 414(d) of the Code, and is \nqualified under section 401(a).  \nUnder a contract between City and Plan, the City and City\u2019s employees are required to \nmake contributions to Plan.  Since Date 1, City has picked up the employees\u2019 required \ncontributions pursuant to section 414(h)(2).  Beginning in Year 1, City and its employees \nentered into Agreement under which a percentage of employees\u2019 statutorily fixed \nsalaries were to be used to pay a portion of City\u2019s required employer contributions to \nPlan.  Thus, the City is paying required employee contributions under the pick-up \narrangement, and employees are paying the City\u2019s required contributions from their \nsalaries pursuant to the Agreement.  You request a ruling that contributions made by \nthe City\u2019s employees under the Agreement are employer contributions, and thus are not \nincome until distributed to the employees.  In addition, you request a ruling that the City \nis not required to withhold Federal income taxes from these contributions under section \nPLR-111250-15\n2\n3402 of the Code and that the contributions are not wages under section 3121 of the \nCode.   \nInitially, the City requested a ruling that the employee contributions under the \nAgreement were pick-up contributions under section 414(h)(2).  Prior to the submission \nof this letter ruling request, the Employee Plans Rulings and Agreements group of the \nTax-Exempt and Government Entities Division determined that the contributions made \npursuant to the Agreement do not qualify as employer contributions under section \n414(h)(2) of the Code.  In response, the City revised its request and now seeks the \nruling described herein.\nSection 61(a) of the Code defines \u201cgross income\u201d as income from any source, including \nany compensation for services.\nSection 402(a) of the Code provides, in general, that an amount actually distributed by \nany employees' trust described in section 401(a) that is exempt from tax under section \n501(a) is taxable to the distributee in the year it is distributed under section 72 (relating \nto annuities).\nSection 1.402(a)-1(a)(1)(i) of the Income Tax Regulations provides that an employee is \nnot required to include in income a contribution made by an employer to a trust \ndescribed in section 401(a) of the Code in a year in which the trust is exempt under \nsection 501(a).  \nSection 414(h)(1) of the Code provides that any amount contributed to an employees' \ntrust described in section 401(a) is not treated as having been made by the employer if \nit is designated as an employee contribution.  Under section 414(h)(2), however, if the \ncontributions of employing units are designated as employee contributions, but an \nemploying unit picks up the contributions, the contributions so picked up are treated as \nemployer contributions.\nSections 3101 and 3111 of the Code impose FICA taxes on \u201cwages.\u201d  The term \u201cwages\u201d \nis defined in section 3121(a) for FICA purposes as all remuneration for employment, \nwith certain specific exceptions not relevant here.  Section 3121(b) defines \n\u201cemployment\u201d as any service, of whatever nature, performed by an employee for the \nperson employing him, with certain specific exceptions not relevant here.\nSection 3402(a) of the Code, relating to income tax withholding, generally requires \nevery employer making a payment of wages to deduct and withhold upon those wages \na tax determined in accordance with prescribed tables or computational procedures.  \nThe term \u201cwages\u201d is defined in section 3401(a) for Federal income tax withholding \npurposes as all remuneration for services performed by an employee for his employer, \nwith certain specific exceptions not relevant here.\nPLR-111250-15\n3\nThe Supreme Court has long established the rule that income must be taxed to the \nperson who earns it.  Commissioner v. Culbertson, 337 U.S. 733, 739-40 (1949).  In \nLucas v. Earl, 281 U.S. 111 (1930), a husband and wife executed a contract whereby \none-half of the husband's future earnings was assigned to the wife.  The Court held that \nthe husband's entire earnings were includible in his gross income in the year earned \neven though there was a valid contract between the husband and wife and the husband \ndid not physically receive one-half of the earnings in cash.  The Court stated:\nThere is no doubt that the statute could tax salaries to those who earned \nthem and provide that the tax could not be escaped by anticipatory \narrangements and contracts however skillfully devised to prevent the \nsalary when paid from vesting even for a second in the man who earned it. \nThat seems to us the import of the statute . . . .\nApplication of this rule is not limited to cases in which the assignor assigned income to a \nclosely related party.  In United States v. Basye, 410 U.S. 441 (1973), the Court applied \nthis rule in a case in which a medical partnership elected to have a nonprofit health plan \nfoundation pay part of the partnership's compensation to a retirement trust.\nIn Rev. Rul. 67-351, 1967-2 C.B. 86, pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement \nbetween a union and a group of employers, a vacation plan and trust are established for \nthe benefit of the employees.  The agreement provides that the employers will pay into \nthe trust a specified amount for each hour worked by qualified employees.  An individual \naccount is established for each qualified employee by the trustees of the trust.  The \nindividual employee's interest in the amount in his vacation account is fully vested and \nnonforfeitable from the time the money is paid by his employer.  The collective \nbargaining agreement further states that payments by the employer shall be a part of \nthe wages due to the employees.  The ruling explains that the contributions to the trust \nshould be regarded as constructive payments of compensation to the employees, and \nthus the contributions to the trust are treated as made by the employees rather than by \nthe employers.  The ruling concludes that the payments to the trust are compensation \nincome to the employees at the time they are made to the trust.  Further, the ruling \nconcludes that the payments to the trust are wages for FICA and Federal income tax \nwithholding purposes.\nTherefore, based solely on the facts presented and the representations made, we \nconclude that contributions made to the Plan under the Agreement are employee \ncontributions and are therefore includable in City employees\u2019 gross incomes under \nsection 61 of the Code at the time of contribution.  Furthermore, as employee \ncontributions, the payments are subject to Federal income tax withholding at the time of \ncontribution and are subject to FICA taxes at the time of contribution unless the \nmaximum wage limitation provided by section 3121(a)(1) applies.\nExcept as expressly provided herein, no opinion is expressed or implied as to the \nPLR-111250-15\n4\nFederal tax consequences of the facts described above under any other provision of the \nCode. \nThis ruling is directed only to the taxpayer requesting it.  Section 6110(k)(3) of the Code \nprovides that it may not be used or cited as precedent.\nThe ruling contained in this letter is based upon information and representations \nsubmitted by Taxpayer and accompanied by a penalty of perjury statement executed by \nan appropriate party.  While this office has not verified any of the material submitted in \nsupport of the request for rulings, it is subject to verification on examination.\nIn accordance with the Power of Attorney on file with this office, a copy of this letter is \nbeing sent to your authorized representative.\nSincerely,\nJohn B.

This letter replies to a letter dated Date 1 in which Trust 2 requests a \nruling that Taxpayer, and not Trust 1 or Trust 2, is entitled to claim credits for the \npurchase of certain qualifying motor vehicles for lease under \u00a7 30D of the Internal \nRevenue Code (Code). \n \n \nThe facts and representations submitted are summarized as follows: \n \nTrust 1 and Trust 2 are each statutory trusts organized pursuant to the laws of \nState.  They are each business trusts as described in \u00a7 301.7701-4(b), and are \ndisregarded entities for federal tax purposes.  Trust 1 and Trust 2 are fiscal year \ntaxpayers and utilize the accrual method of accounting.  Together, Trust 1 and Trust 2 \nare members of the same affiliated group that file a consolidated U.S. federal income \ntax return with Parent serving as the common parent.  Parent is a regarded entity for \nfederal tax purposes.  Taxpayer is a limited liability company organized under the laws \nof State, and has elected to be classified as a corporation for federal income tax \n \nPLR-117024-21 \n \n2 \npurposes pursuant to \u00a7 301.7701-3(a). Taxpayer files a federal income tax return \nseparate from Trust 1, Trust 2, and Parent, and is not part of their consolidated return. \n \nTrust 1 and Trust 2 each separately purchase qualifying electric vehicles in order \nto make them available for lease.  Upon purchase, title to such vehicles pass to Trust 1 \nor Trust 2 under the laws of various states.  For the transactions that are the subject of \nthis ruling request, Trust 1 and Trust 2 each intend to purchase new qualified plug-in \nelectric drive motor vehicles for lease to Trust 1\u2019s and Trust 2\u2019s customers in the \nordinary course of Trust 1\u2019s and Trust 2\u2019s businesses.  All of the vehicles are of the \nyear, make, and model identified on the Services list of qualified vehicles acquired after \nDecember 31, 2009.  In other words, the vehicles: (1) are made by a manufacturer; (2) \ntreated as motor vehicles for purposes of Title II of the Clean Air Act; (3) have gross \nvehicle weight ratings of less than 14,000 pounds; and (4) are propelled to a significant \nextent by an electric motor which draws electricity from batteries which have a capacity \nof not less than four kilowatt hours and are capable of being recharged from an external \nsource of electricity. \n \nPursuant to their respective most recent trust agreements among the settlor, \nbeneficiary, trust administrator, administrative trustee, and State trustee, Trust 1 and \nTrust 2 allocate beneficial ownership in their assets, which consist of title to the leased \nmotor vehicles, to Taxpayer.  Trust 1 and Trust 2 issue certificates to Taxpayer \nevidencing Taxpayer\u2019s special unit of beneficial interest (SUBI) in the trust property.  \nThe beneficial ownership of all of the leased electric motor vehicles that are titled in the \nname of Trust 1 and Trust 2 is represented to be with Taxpayer, per law of State, as \nwell as the written agreements governing Trust 1 and Trust 2 as statutory trusts.  \nHowever, while the controlling instruments of Trust 1 and Trust 2 permit Taxpayer to \nretitle the vehicles to itself under the various states in which Trust 1 and Trust 2 have \ntitled the vehicles, Taxpayer has not done so. \n \nWhen either Trust 1 or Trust 2 purchases a motor vehicle for lease, upon \npurchase, Trust 1 and Trust 2 immediately designate Taxpayer as the owner of the \nvehicle for federal income tax purposes pursuant to its certificate evidencing a SUBI in \neither Trust 1 or Trust 2\u2019s property.  Trust 1 or Trust 2 is issued a certificate of title for \nsuch vehicle by the motor vehicle regulatory authority of the state in which the vehicle is \ntitled.  The vehicle is then placed in service by Trust 1 or Trust 2 for use by way of \noffering the vehicles for lease as part of Trust 1 or Trust 2\u2019s ordinary course of business.  \nFurther, at the time the vehicles are leased, Trust 1 and Trust 2 are listed as the lessors \non the lease agreements. Taxpayer does not take part in either the purchasing, nor the \nleasing of the vehicles.  Taxpayer does not have a leasing business through which the \nvehicles are leased. \n \nRuling Requested \n \nWhether, under the facts described above, (1) Taxpayer is allowed or is eligible for \ncredits under \u00a7 30D(a) upon the purchase of qualifying electric vehicles and offering \n \nPLR-117024-21 \n \n3 \nsuch vehicles for lease; and, consequently, whether (2) Trust 1 and Trust 2, after \nmaking such purchases and placing such vehicles in service by offering such vehicles \nfor lease, are not allowed or are not eligible for such credits under \u00a7 30D(a) of the Code. \n \nLaw and Analysis \n \n \nSection 30D(a) of the Code allows as a credit against income tax imposed for the \ntaxable year an amount equal to the sum of the credit amounts determined under          \n\u00a7 30D(b) of the Code with respect to each new qualified plug-in electric drive motor \nvehicle placed in service by a taxpayer during the taxable year. The amount of the credit \nis determined under \u00a7 30D(b) of the Code. \n \nSection 30D(d)(1) of the Code defines a credit-eligible \u201cnew qualified plug-in \nelectric drive motor vehicle\u201d as a motor vehicle: \n(A) the original use of which commences with the taxpayer, \n(B) which is acquired for use or lease by the taxpayer and not for resale, \n(C) which is made by a manufacturer, \n(D) which is treated as a motor vehicle for purposes of title II of the Clean Air Act, \n(E) which has a gross vehicle weight rating of less than 14,000 pounds, and \n(F) which is propelled to a significant extent by an electric motor which draws \nelectricity from a battery which\u2014 \n(i) has a capacity of not less than 4 kilowatt hours, and \n(ii) is capable of being recharged from an external source of electricity. \n \nThe Service has not promulgated regulations interpreting \u00a7 30D of the Code. \nHowever, the Service issued Notice 2009-89, 2009-48 I.R.B. 714, which set forth \n\u201cinterim guidance, pending the issuance of regulations, relating to\u201d the credits \nauthorized by \u00a7 30D. Section 5.02 of Notice 2009-89 provides that a purchaser of a \nmotor vehicle may rely on the manufacturer\u2019s (or, in the case of a foreign vehicle \nmanufacturer, its domestic distributor\u2019s) certification concerning the vehicle and the \namount of the credit allowable with respect to the vehicle if the following requirements \nare satisfied: (1) the vehicle is placed in service by the taxpayer in a taxable year \nbeginning after December 31, 2009, and is acquired by the taxpayer after December 31, \n2009; (2) the original use of the vehicle commences with the taxpayer; (3) the vehicle is \nacquired for use or lease by the taxpayer, and not for resale; and (4) the vehicle is used \npredominantly in the United States. Section 4.02 of Notice 2009-89 provides that \u201ca \nvehicle is not \u2018acquired\u2019 before the date on which title to that vehicle passes under state \nlaw.\u201d \n \nThe electric vehicles in question would satisfy all elements for such credits under \nthe definition of \u201cnew qualified plug-in electric drive motor vehicle\u201d in \u00a7 30D(d)(1). As \ndiscussed above, all of the motor vehicles at issue in this letter ruling request are (1) \nmade by a manufacturer; (2) treated as motor vehicles for purposes of title II of the \nClean Air Act; (3) have gross vehicle weight ratings of less than 14,000 pounds; and (4) \nare propelled to a significant extent by an electric motor which draws electricity from \n \nPLR-117024-21 \n \n4 \nbatteries which have a capacity of not less than four kilowatt hours and are capable of \nbeing recharged from an external source of electricity. Such vehicles, which are also on \nService\u2019s list of qualified vehicles acquired after December 31, 2009, would therefore \nsatisfy the definitional elements set forth in subsections (d)(1)(C) through (d)(1)(F). \n \nFor a taxpayer to obtain this credit, \u00a7 30(d)(1)(A) requires that the \u201coriginal use\u201d \nof the qualifying vehicle commence with that taxpayer. Actions that constitute or are \nconsistent with \u201coriginal use\u201d are not delineated in the statute or accompanying \nguidance. First, we look to the acquisition of the electric vehicles. Next, we look to the \noriginal use, when the vehicles were originally placed in service by being made \navailable for lease.  \n \nTrust 1 and Trust 2 purchased qualifying electric vehicles, and the vehicles were \ntitled to Trust 1 or Trust 2 when title to the vehicles passed under state law.  Trust 1 and \nTrust 2 each purchased the vehicles with the intent to lease them in the normal course \nof their respective businesses. Subsequent to the purchase of and titling of the vehicles, \nand as part of Trust 1 and Trust 2\u2019s normal business operations, Trust 1 and Trust 2 \nplaced the vehicles in service by offering them for lease, with Trust 1 or Trust 2 being \nlisted as the lessor on the respective lease agreements when the lease transactions \nwere completed.  Taxpayer, as a SUBI holder, did not title the vehicles under any state \nlaw, offer any vehicle for lease in the course of its business operations, nor did \nTaxpayer enter into any leasing transaction with any lessee. \n \nBecause Trust 1 and Trust 2 are disregarded entities for federal tax purposes, \nthe purchases and subsequent leases by Trust 1 and Trust 2 of electric vehicles for \nlease in the Transactions would entitle Parent to federal income tax credits under          \n\u00a7 30D.  Parent, as the regarded parent of Trust 1 and Trust 2, would be deemed to have \nacquired the vehicles and placed such vehicles in service.  Taxpayer neither acquired \nthe vehicles nor placed the vehicles in service, and therefore is ineligible for the credit \nunder \u00a7 30D. \nConclusion \n \nBased on the representations made and consideration of the descriptions and \ndocuments submitted, we conclude that the requirements of \u00a7 30D have not been met \nto qualify Taxpayer for entitlement to claiming the \u00a7 30D credit.  Based solely on the \nfacts and representations submitted, we are adverse to Taxpayer\u2019s requested ruling. \n \nExcept as specifically set forth above, we neither express nor imply any opinion \nconcerning the federal income tax consequences of any aspect of any transaction or \nitem discussed or referenced in this letter. \n \n \nThe ruling contained in this letter are based upon information and \nrepresentations submitted by Taxpayer and accompanied by a penalties of perjury \nstatement executed by an appropriate party.  While this office has not verified any of the \nmaterial submitted in support of the request for rulings, it is subject to verification on \n \nPLR-117024-21 \n \n5 \nexamination.  The ruling is directed only to the taxpayer requesting it.  Section \n6110(k)(3) provides that it may not be used or cited as precedent. \n \n \nIn accordance with the power of attorney, we are sending copies of this letter to \nTaxpayer\u2019s authorized representatives.  We are also sending a copy of this letter to the \nappropriate Industry Director, LB&I.  A copy of this ruling must be attached to any \nfederal income tax return to which it is relevant.  Alternatively, taxpayers filing their \nreturns electronically may satisfy this requirement by attaching a statement to their \nreturn that provides the date and control number of the letter ruling. \n \nSincerely, \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPatrick S.

Corporation was formed on Date 1 under \nthe laws of State, and operates a building in a cooperative form of ownership.  The \nbuilding consists of b residential units and a commercial space, which is leased to \nTenant.  Corporation=s lease with Tenant expires on Date 2.  \n \nCorporation proposes to allocate shares of its authorized but unissued stock to \nthe commercial space for future conversion of the space into c residential units.  \nCorporation proposes to sell the stock to be allocated to the residential units to Tenant, \nand thereafter Corporation and Tenant will cancel the Tenant\u2019s lease.   \n \nCorporation represents that the shares to be issued with respect to each unit will \nbe fully paid up in an amount bearing a reasonable relationship to the portion of the \nvalue of Corporation=s equity in the building and land that is attributable to each unit.   \n \n2 \nPLR-113281-04 \n \nThe proprietary lease will entitle Tenant as the purchaser of the additional shares \nattributable to the commercial space to occupy the unit either for retail purposes or as a \nresidential apartment. The owner of the unit will at all times have the right, as against \nCorporation, to occupy the unit for dwelling purposes.  \n \nCorporation represents that the local zoning law and building regulations \ncurrently permit modification of the commercial space to residential use as a matter of \nright.  The size and location of the commercial space is such that, with certain \nmodifications, it could be converted into residential apartments.  Corporation submits \nfacts and representations to show that the cost of adding sleeping and cooking facilities \nis less than 20% of the fair market value the units would have if they were sold as \nresidential units.   \n \nYou have specifically requested two rulings: \n \n1)  Provided Corporation satisfies the requirements of ' 216(b)(1)(A), (C) and \n(D), neither the issuance of stock by Corporation to be allocated to the commercial \nspace nor the possible nonresidential use of the commercial space will prevent \nCorporation from qualifying as a cooperative housing corporation within the meaning of \n' 216(b)(1). \n \n2) Tenant who purchases the stock of Corporation attributable to the commercial \nspace for the commercial use of such space will qualify as a Atenant-stockholder@ for \npurposes of ' 216(b)(2), provided such stock is fully paid up in an amount which bears a \nreasonable relationship to the portion of the value of Corporation=s equity in the building \nand land which is attributable to the commercial space. \n \nSection 216(b)(1) provides that the term Acooperative housing corporation@ \nmeans a corporation - (A) having one and only one class of stock outstanding, (B) each \nof the stockholders of which is entitled, solely by reason of his ownership of stock in the \ncorporation, to occupy for dwelling purposes a house, or an apartment in a building, \nowned or leased by the corporation, (C) no stockholder of which is entitled (either \nconditionally or unconditionally) to receive any distribution not out of earnings and \nprofits of the corporation except on a complete or partial liquidation of the corporation, \nand (D) 80 percent or more of the gross income of which for the taxable year in which \nthe taxes and interest described in ' 216(a) are paid or incurred is derived from  \ntenant-stockholders. \n \nSection 216(b)(2) provides that the term Atenant-stockholder@ means a person \nwho is a stockholder in a cooperative housing corporation, and whose stock is fully \npaid-up in an amount not less than an amount shown to the satisfaction of the Secretary \nas bearing a reasonable relationship to the portion of the value of the corporation=s \n3 \nPLR-113281-04 \n \nequity in the house or apartment building and the land on which situated which is \nattributable to the house or apartment which such person is entitled to occupy.  \n \nRev. Rul. 74-241, 1974-1 C.B. 68, holds that, for purposes of ' 216(b)(1)(B), the \nterm Aapartment in a building@ means an independent housekeeping unit consisting of \none or more rooms containing facilities for cooking, sleeping, and sanitation normally \nfound in a principal residence.   \n \nRev. Rul. 90-35, 1990-2 C.B. 48, provides that Rev. Rul. 74-241 does not require \nthat a unit presently contain all the facilities normally found in a principal residence in \norder to constitute an apartment in a building for purposes of ' 216(b)(1)(B).  A unit will \nbe treated as meeting that definition if (1) the stockholder is entitled to convert the unit \nto an apartment, as defined in Rev. Rul. 74-241, solely by reason of ownership of stock \nin the cooperative housing corporation; (2) the conversion of the unit would be \nreasonable under all the facts and circumstances, including structural feasibility and \ncost; and (3) the applicable local zoning, building, and fire codes permit both the \nconversion and residential use of the unit as a matter of right.  \n \nApplying the above standards to the facts and representations submitted and \nsubject to the limitation below, we conclude that provided Corporation meets the \nrequirements of ' 216(b)(1)(A), (C), and (D), neither the issuance of stock by \nCorporation to be allocated to the commercial space nor the possible nonresidential use \nof the commercial space will prevent Corporation from qualifying as a cooperative \nhousing corporation within the meaning of ' 216(b)(1). \n \nWe also conclude that Tenant who purchases the stock of Corporation \nattributable to the commercial space for the commercial or residential use of the space \nwill qualify as a Atenant-stockholder@ for purposes of ' 216(b)(2), provided the stock is \nfully paid up in an amount which bears a reasonable relationship to the portion of the \nvalue of Corporation=s equity in the apartment building and land which is attributable to \nthe commercial space which Tenant is entitled to occupy.   \n \nExcept as expressly provided herein, we express or imply no opinion concerning \nthe tax consequences of any aspect of any transaction or item discussed or referenced \nin this letter.

The information \nprovided in that request and in subsequent correspondence is summarized below.\nParent, a corporation organized under the laws of State A, operates as a holding \ncompany.  Parent is the common parent of an affiliated group of corporations (\u201cParent\u2019s \nconsolidated group\u201d) that files a \u201clife-nonlife\u201d consolidated federal income tax return \npursuant to \u00a7 1504(c)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code.\nOldco, a company organized under the laws of Country X, is an insurance company.  \nOldco is a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Parent and a member of Parent\u2019s \nconsolidated group.  Oldco elected to be treated as a domestic corporation for federal \ntax purposes under \u00a7 953(d) effective as of Date 1.\nOldco proposes to follow the legally prescribed processes in Country X and Country Y, \nrespectively, pursuant to a written plan of reorganization to change its place of \nincorporation from Country X to Country Y (the \u201cProposed Transaction\u201d).\nOldco makes the following representations with respect to the Proposed Transaction:\n(a)\nOldco is classified as an association taxable as a corporation for federal tax \npurposes and is treated as a domestic corporation for federal tax purposes.\n(b)\nSince Date 1, the effective date of its election under \u00a7 953(d), Oldco has \nsatisfied the requirements to be treated as a domestic corporation for federal \ntax purposes pursuant to that section.\n(c)\nFollowing the Proposed Transaction, Newco will continue to satisfy the \nrequirements to be treated as a domestic corporation for federal tax purposes \npursuant to \u00a7 953(d).\n(d)\nOldco is not presently, and Newco will not be immediately after the Proposed \nTransaction, under the jurisdiction of any court in a Title 11 or similar case \nwithin the meaning of \u00a7 368(a)(3)(A).\n(e)\nThe Proposed Transaction will be consummated pursuant to a written plan of \nreorganization, will be effected solely by the change in place of incorporation of \nOldco under the laws of Country X and Country Y, and will be undertaken for a \nbona fide business purpose.\n(f)\nThe Proposed Transaction will be effected in a manner that complies with all \nthe applicable legal and regulatory requirements.\nPLR-137718-10\n3\n(g)\nParent will be the sole shareholder of Oldco immediately before the Proposed \nTransaction and the sole shareholder of Newco immediately after the Proposed \nTransaction.\n(h)\nAt the time of the Proposed Transaction, Oldco will not have any warrants, \noptions, convertible securities, or any other type of right pursuant to which any \nperson could acquire an ownership interest in Oldco.\n(i)\nParent will own all of the outstanding shares of Newco immediately after the \nProposed Transaction solely by reason of its ownership of the shares of Oldco \nimmediately before the Proposed Transaction.\n(j)\nNewco has no plan or intention to reacquire any of its shares following the \nProposed Transaction.\n(k)\nThe fair market value of Newco shares held by Parent immediately after the \nProposed Transaction will be approximately equal to the fair market value of \nOldco shares held by Parent immediately before the Proposed Transaction.\n(l)\nImmediately after the Proposed Transaction, Newco will possess the same \nassets and liabilities as those possessed by Oldco immediately before the \nProposed Transaction except for assets used to pay expenses, if any, incurred \nin connection with the Proposed Transaction.  No assets will be distributed by \nOldco in the Proposed Transaction.\n(m) Newco has no plan or intention to sell or otherwise dispose of any of the assets \nheld by Oldco immediately before the Proposed Transaction, except for \ndispositions made in the ordinary course of business.\n(n)\nThe liabilities of Oldco deemed to be assumed by Newco in the Proposed \nTransaction, plus the liabilities, if any, to which the assets of Oldco deemed to \nbe transferred to Newco in the Proposed Transaction are subject, will have \nbeen incurred by Oldco in the ordinary course of its business and are \nassociated with the assets deemed to be transferred.\n(o)\nEach of Parent, Oldco, and Newco will pay its respective expenses, if any, \nincurred in connection with the Proposed Transaction.\n(p)\nAssuming that the Proposed Transaction constitutes a reorganization within the \nmeaning of \u00a7 368(a)(1)(F), (i) Newco will constitute a \u201csuccessor\u201d within the \nmeaning of \u00a7 1.1502-1(f)(4)(i) of the Income Tax Regulations with respect to \nOldco; (ii) Newco will constitute a \u201csuccessor person\u201d within the meaning of \n\u00a7 1.1502-13(j)(2) with respect to Oldco; and (iii) Newco will constitute an \n\u201celigible corporation\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 1.1502-47(d)(12)(i) with respect to \nthe Parent\u2019s consolidated group.\nPLR-137718-10\n4\nBased solely upon the information submitted and the representations set forth above, \nwe rule as follows:\n1.\nThe Proposed Transaction will constitute a reorganization within the meaning of \n\u00a7 368(a)(1)(F).  Oldco and Newco will each be \u201ca party to the reorganization\u201d \nunder \u00a7 368(b).\n2.\nOldco\u2019s 953(d) election will not terminate as a result of the Proposed \nTransaction.\n3.\nOldco will recognize no gain or loss on the deemed transfer of assets to Newco \nin exchange for Newco stock and Newco\u2019s assumption of Oldco\u2019s liabilities in \nthe Proposed Transaction (\u00a7\u00a7 361(a) and 357(a)).\n4.\nNewco will recognize no gain or loss on the receipt of Oldco\u2019s assets and \nliabilities in the deemed exchange for Newco stock (\u00a7 1032(a)).\n5.\nThe basis of each asset held by Newco immediately after the Proposed \nTransaction will be the same as the basis of such asset in the hands of Oldco \nimmediately prior to the Proposed Transaction (\u00a7 362(b)).\n6.\nThe holding period of each asset held by Newco immediately after the \nProposed transaction will include the period during which such asset was held \nby Oldco (\u00a7 1223(2)).\n7.\nOldco will recognize no gain or loss on the deemed distribution to Parent of the \nNewco stock (\u00a7 361(c)(1)).\n8.\nParent will recognize no gain or loss on the deemed exchange of the Oldco \nstock for Newco stock (\u00a7 354(a)(1)).\n9.\nThe basis of the shares of Newco stock deemed to be received by Parent will \nbe the same as the basis in the Oldco stock deemed to be exchanged therefore \n(\u00a7 358(a)).\n10.\nThe holding period of the shares of Newco stock deemed to be received by \nParent in the Proposed Transaction will include the holding period of the shares \nof Oldco deemed to be exchanged therefor, provided that Parent holds the \nOldco stock as a capital asset on the date of the Proposed Transaction \n(\u00a7 1223(1)).\n11.\nThe tax attributes of Oldco enumerated in \u00a7 381(c) will be taken into account by \nNewco as if there had been no reorganization (\u00a7 1.381(b)-1(a)(2)).\nPLR-137718-10\n5\n12.\nThe taxable year of Oldco will not end on the date of the Proposed Transaction, \nand such tax year continues in the name of Newco (\u00a7 1.381(b)-1).\nExcept as expressly provided herein, no opinion is expressed or implied concerning the \ntax consequences of any aspect of any transaction or item discussed or referenced in \nthis letter.\nThis ruling is directed only to the taxpayer requesting it.  Section 6110(k)(3) of the Code \nprovides that it may not be used or cited as precedent.\nTemporary or final regulations pertaining to one or more of the issues addressed in this \nruling have not yet been adopted.

X is wholly-owned by Parent.  \nTaxpayer is a member of Parent\u2019s consolidated group that files a consolidated federal \nincome tax return on a calendar year basis using an accrual method of accounting.   \nTaxpayer is engaged in the purchase, transmission, distribution, and sale of electric \nenergy in State A and State B.  Taxpayer is subject to regulation with respect to terms \nand conditions of services by Commission A, Commission B, and Commission C.  Each \nPLR-132097-17\n3\nof these regulators establishes Taxpayer\u2019s rates based on its costs, including a \nprovision for a return on the capital employed by Taxpayer in its regulated business.\nTaxpayer has claimed (and continues to claim) accelerated depreciation on all of its \npublic utility property to the full extent those deductions are available under the Code.  \nTaxpayer normalizes the federal income taxes deferred as a result of its claiming these \ndeductions in accordance with the Normalization Rules.  As a consequence, Taxpayer \nhas a substantial balance of Accumulated Deferred Federal Income Taxes (ADFIT) that \nis attributable to the accelerated depreciation reflected on both its State A and State B \nregulated books of account.  In its general rate cases, Taxpayer reduces its rate base \nupon which its return component was computed by its ADFIT balance.   \nTaxpayer has generated significant net operating losses (\u201cNOLs\u201d) in a number of prior \ntax years and continues to have an NOL carryforward (\u201cNOLC\u201d) balance.  To accurately \nreflect the economics of this NOLC, Taxpayer has recorded a deferred tax asset \n(\u201cDTA\u201d) on both its State A and State B regulated books of account.  Taxpayer properly \ntakes this DTA into account when computing the ADFIT balance by which it reduces its \nrate base and both Commission A and Commission B have accepted this treatment.     \nPrior to Year 4, Taxpayer had been a member of an affiliated group of corporations of \nwhich X was the common parent (\u201cX Group\u201d).  The members of the X Group had, for \nmany years, joined in the filing of a consolidated federal income tax return.  By Year 3, \nthe X Group had been under IRS audit for a considerable period of time with respect to \nits federal income taxes for Year 1 through Year 2.  The audit resulted in proposed \nadjustments, both positive and negative, to the taxable income of a number of X Group \nmembers, including both regulated and non-regulated members.  \nOn Date 1, the IRS and X Group entered into a settlement (\u201cIRS Settlement\u201d).  The IRS \nSettlement resulted in a net positive adjustment to the X Group\u2019s consolidated taxable \nincome during the audit period which absorbed a portion of the then-existing \nconsolidated NOLC.  Of the consolidated NOLC absorbed, approximately $a was \nattributable to Taxpayer.  Under the tax sharing agreement for the X Group Taxpayer \nreceived approximately $b in net payments during Date 4 and Date 5 from the X Group \nfor use of Taxpayer\u2019s NOLC.    \nIn Date 2, the month subsequent to the IRS Settlement being finalized, the results were \nrecorded in the appropriate DTA accounts on Taxpayer\u2019s books and records.  The \nrecordation resulted in a reduction in Taxpayer\u2019s NOLC-related DTA.  By reducing \nTaxpayer\u2019s DTA, this recordation increased Taxpayer\u2019s net ADFIT balance.\n   \nState A Ratemaking \nOn Date 7, Taxpayer filed an application with Commission A to request an increase in \nits retail rates for electricity.  Taxpayer\u2019s application used a 12-month test period ending \nPLR-132097-17\n4\nDate 3, with an effective date of Date 8 for the rates established in this proceeding.   \nThus, the test period was an historic test period.  In computing its rate base, Taxpayer \nemployed a 13-month averaging convention for all of the constituent elements, including \nADFIT.  During the proceeding, the proper calculation of the ADFIT balance by which \nrate base should be reduced became an issue in dispute. \nIn computing the amount of ADFIT by which rate base should be reduced, Taxpayer \napplied its applicable rate base convention, a 13-month average, to its monthly ADFIT \nbalances for the test period and multiplied this amount by the State A distribution \njurisdictional factor (c%).  In its general rate case, Taxpayer reflected the impact of the \nIRS Settlement on Taxpayer\u2019s ADFIT balance as being $d.  Applying the jurisdictional \nfactor to this ADFIT impact, Taxpayer calculated that approximately $e was attributable \nto its State A electric distribution business.  Since the IRS Settlement was recorded on \nDate 2, the last month of the test period, using the regulatory convention employed for \nall other elements of rate base, only 1/13th of the effect of the IRS Settlement ($e/13 or \napproximately $f) was included in the Taxpayer\u2019s calculation of the ADFIT balance by \nwhich it reduced rate base.   \nA third party intervenor (Intervenor 1) proposed to adjust Taxpayer\u2019s computation of \nADFIT on account of the impact of the IRS Settlement.  Specifically, Intervenor 1 \nproposed to treat the full impact of the IRS Settlement as a reduction in Taxpayer\u2019s \nADFIT balance.  Thus, Intervenor 1 proposed to take into account not just the $f\nreduction Taxpayer reflected in its rate base calculation but an additional $g, such that \nthe entire jurisdictional impact of the IRS Settlement ($e) was incorporated into rates.   \nOn Date 10, Commission A issued Order 1 in which it adopted Intervenor 1\u2019s proposed \nADFIT adjustment based on the proposition that the impact of the IRS Settlement is \n\u201cknown\u201d and will continue through the rate effective period.  On Date 11, Taxpayer filed \na motion in which Taxpayer asserted its view that incorporating the treatment of the IRS \nSettlement proposed by Intervenor 1 would constitute a violation of the Normalization \nRules.  In response to Taxpayer\u2019s filing, on Date 12, Commission A issued Order 2 in \nwhich it directed Taxpayer to request a Private Letter Ruling (\u201cPLR\u201d) from the Service to \nclarify the impact of the normalization rule within the context of Order 2.\nState B Ratemaking\nOn Date 9, Taxpayer filed an application with Commission B to request an increase in \nits retail rates for electricity.  This application was considered by Commission B in Case.  \nTaxpayer\u2019s application used a 12-month test period ending Date 6, with an effective \ndate of Date 14 for the rates established in this proceeding.  Thus, the test period was \nan historic test period.  In computing its rate base, Taxpayer employed a 13-month \naveraging convention for all of the constituent elements.  ADFIT was also computed by \nTaxpayer based on the 13-month averaging convention.    \nPLR-132097-17\n5\nIn computing the amount of ADFIT by which rate base should be reduced, Taxpayer \napplied its applicable rate base convention, a 13-month average, to its monthly ADFIT \nbalances for the test period and multiplied this amount by the State B distribution \njurisdictional factor (h%).  In basing the test year ADFIT balance on the 13-month \naveraging convention, Taxpayer applied the jurisdictional factor to the impact of the IRS \nSettlement detailed above.  In its filings in Case, Taxpayer proposed that the impact of \nthe IRS Settlement on Taxpayer\u2019s ADFIT balance should be $i.  Applying the \njurisdictional factor to this ADFIT impact, Taxpayer calculated that approximately $j was \nattributable to its State B electric distribution business.  Since the IRS Settlement was \nrecorded on Date 2, using the regulatory convention employed for all other elements of \nrate base, only 4/13th of the effect of the IRS Settlement or approximately $k was \nincluded in the Taxpayer\u2019s calculation of the ADFIT balance by which it reduced rate \nbase.   \nA third party intervenor (Intervenor 2) proposed to adjust Taxpayer\u2019s computation of \nADFIT on account of the impact of the IRS Settlement.  Specifically, Intervenor 2 \nproposed to treat the full impact of the IRS Settlement as a reduction in Taxpayer\u2019s \nADFIT balance (without application of the 13-month averaging convention).  Intervenor \n2 characterized the proposed adjustment as \u201cannualizing\u201d the impact of the IRS \nSettlement to take into account not just the reduction Taxpayer reflected in its rate base \ncalculation but an additional $l such that the entire jurisdictional impact of the IRS \nSettlement would be incorporated into rates.  Intervenor 2 indicated that while the \nreduction in the NOL DTA was not booked by the Taxpayer until Date 2, the NOL DTA \nwas on the Taxpayer\u2019s books before the beginning of the test year.  \nTaxpayer contested this proposed adjustment asserting that its implementation would \nconstitute a violation of the Normalization Rules.  In response to Taxpayer\u2019s filings, on \nDate 13, Commission B issued Order 3 in which it directed that the Taxpayer to request \na PLR from the Service to clarify the impact of the Normalization Rules before \nCommission B finally decides whether to annualize the cash that Taxpayer received on \nDate 2 as part of the IRS Settlement.   \nTaxpayer requests that we rule as follows:\nWhether, the application of a 13-month average regulatory convention to most elements \nof rate base, including most elements of Taxpayer\u2019s ADFIT balance, and the application \nof a different regulatory convention (end of test period) to the impact of the IRS \nSettlement is acceptable under the Normalization Rules.\nLaw and Analysis\n  \nFormer section 167(l) of the Code generally provided that public utilities were entitled to \nuse accelerated methods of depreciation if they used a \u201cnormalization method of \naccounting.\u201d  A normalization method of accounting was defined in former \u00a7 167(l)(3)(G) \nPLR-132097-17\n6\nin a manner consistent with that found in \u00a7 168(i)(9)(A).  \nIn order to use a normalization method of accounting, \u00a7 168(i)(9)(A) requires that a \ntaxpayer, in computing its tax expense for establishing its cost of service for ratemaking \npurposes and reflecting operating results in its regulated books of account, use a \nmethod of depreciation with respect to public utility property that is the same as, and a \ndepreciation period for such property that is not shorter than, the method and period \nused to compute its depreciation expense for such purposes.  Under \u00a7 168(i)(9)(A)(ii), if \nthe amount allowable as a deduction under \u00a7 168 differs from the amount that would be \nallowable as a deduction under \u00a7 167 using the method, period, first and last year \nconvention, and salvage value used to compute regulated tax expense under                  \n\u00a7 168(i)(9)(A)(i), the taxpayer must make adjustments to a reserve to reflect the deferral \nof taxes resulting from such difference.\nSection 168(i)(9)(B)(i) provides that one way the requirements of \u00a7 168(i)(9)(A) will not \nbe satisfied is if the taxpayer, for ratemaking purposes, uses a procedure or adjustment \nwhich is inconsistent with such requirements.  Under \u00a7 168(i)(9)(B)(ii), such inconsistent \nprocedures and adjustments include the use of an estimate or projection of the \ntaxpayer\u2019s tax expense, depreciation expense, or reserve for deferred taxes under          \n\u00a7 168(i)(9)(A)(ii), unless such estimate or projection is also used, for ratemaking \npurposes, with respect to all three of these items and with respect to the rate base.  This \nis known as the Consistency Rule.\nIn order to satisfy the requirements of \u00a7 168(i)(9)(B), there must be consistency in the \nprocedures and adjustments used in ratemaking to calculate elements in rate base, \ndepreciation expense, tax expense, and the reserve for deferred taxes.  In this case, the \nIRS settlement has an effect on Taxpayer\u2019s ADFIT balance and the Taxpayer, along \nwith Commission A and Commission B, agree that the settlement must be taken into \naccount in setting Taxpayer\u2019s rates.  The only question is whether the same convention \nused to calculate other elements of rate base, including ADFIT, a 13-month averaging \nconvention, must also apply to calculate the effect of the IRS Settlement, or whether a \ndifferent convention may apply to this element.  Using the same convention would result \nin the consistent calculation of Taxpayer\u2019s tax expense, depreciation expense, and \nADFIT as required by \u00a7 168(i)(9)(B).  Applying a different regulatory convention solely to \ncalculate the effect of the IRS Settlement would not satisfy the requirements of \u00a7 \n168(i)(9)(B) and the Consistency Rule.  \nConclusion\nWe conclude that the application of a 13-month average regulatory convention to most \nelements of rate base, including most elements of Taxpayer\u2019s ADFIT balance, and the \napplication of a different regulatory convention (end of test period) to the impact of the \nIRS Settlement is not acceptable under the Normalization Rules.  \nPLR-132097-17\n7\nExcept as specifically determined above, no opinion is expressed or implied concerning \nthe Federal income tax consequences of the matters described above.\nThis ruling is directed only to the taxpayer who requested it. Section 6110(k)(3) of the \nCode provides it may not be used or cited as precedent.  In accordance with the power \nof attorney on file with this office, a copy of this letter is being sent to your authorized \nrepresentative.

A is X corp\u2019s sole shareholder and B is A\u2019s\nspouse.  \nX proposes to create Y, which is intended to qualify as a\ncharitable reminder unitrust under \u00a7 664.  X corp intends to\ncontribute appreciated marketable securities to Y and Y will pay\nthe unitrust amount in quarter annual installments to X corp for\na period of 19 years, then to A and B equally for their lives,\nand then to the survivor of A and B for life.  If X corp is\nliquidated before the end of the 19-year term, Y will pay the\nunitrust amount to the shareholder(s) of X corp for the remainder\nof the 19 years.  The unitrust amount will be an amount equal to\na specified percent (which is not less than 5 percent nor more\nthan 50 percent) of the net fair market value of the assets of Y \nvalued as of the first day of each taxable year of Y and will\nyield a present value passing to the charitable remainder \nbeneficiary equal to at least 10% of the net fair market value of\nthe property transferred to Y on the date of contribution.  After\nthe deaths of both A and B or at the end of the 19 years,\nwhichever is later, the remainder of Y will be distributed to\n2\nMr. Alfred G. Thomsen\n-2-\nqualified charitable organizations.\nSection 664(d)(2) defines a charitable remainder unitrust as\na trust that meets the requirements contained in \u00a7 664(d)(2)(A)-\n(D).  In determining whether Y will qualify as a charitable\nremainder unitrust, we must first address whether the proposed\ntrust will be properly classified as a trust for federal income\ntax purposes.  This requires an analysis of the rules relating to\nidentification of the grantor(s) of the proposed trust and the\nentity classification regulations.  \nSection 1.671-2(e)(1) of the Income Tax Regulations provides\nthat for purposes of part I of Subchapter J, chapter 1, of the\nCode, which includes \u00a7 664, a grantor includes any person to the\nextent such person either creates a trust, or directly or\nindirectly makes a gratuitous transfer (within the meaning of \u00a7\n1.671-2(e)(2)) of property to a trust.  However, a person who\ncreates a trust but makes no gratuitous transfers to the trust is\nnot treated as an owner of any portion of the trust under \u00a7\u00a7 671\nthrough 677 or 679.\nSection 1.671-2(e)(2)(i) provides that a gratuitous transfer\nis any transfer other than a transfer for fair market value.  A\ntransfer of property to a trust may be considered a gratuitous \ntransfer without regard to whether the transfer is treated as a\ngift for gift tax purposes.\nSection 1.671-2(e)(2)(ii) provides that for the purposes of\n\u00a7 1.671-2(e), a transfer is for fair market value only to the\nextent of the value of property received from the trust, services\nrendered by the trust, or the right to use property of the trust. \nFor purposes of this determination, an interest in the trust is\nnot property received from the trust.\nSection 1.671-2(e)(4) provides that, if a gratuitous\ntransfer is made by a partnership or corporation to a trust and\nis for a business purpose of the partnership or corporation, the\npartnership or corporation will generally be treated as the\ngrantor of the trust.  However, if a partnership or a corporation\nmakes a gratuitous transfer to a trust that is not for a business\npurpose of the partnership or corporation but is for the personal\npurposes of one or more of the partners or shareholders, the\ngratuitous transfer will be treated as a constructive\ndistribution to such partners or shareholders under federal tax\nprinciples and the partners or the shareholders will be treated\nas the grantors of the trust. \nX corp proposes to create an arrangement in which a unitrust\namount, based on a percentage of the fair market value of assets\nheld by the proposed trust, is payable to X corp for 19 years and\nthen to its shareholder and the shareholder's spouse for life.  X\ncorp\u2019s gratuitous transfer to Y is only partially for a business\n3\nMr. Alfred G. Thomsen\n-3-\npurpose.  A portion of the transfer will be for the benefit of\nits shareholder and his spouse.  As a consequence, under \u00a7 1.671-\n2(e)(4), a portion of the appreciated marketable securities that\nX corp proposes to contribute to Y will be treated as\nconstructively distributed to A, who then will be treated as\nmaking a gratuitous transfer of that property to Y.  The amount\nof the constructive distribution will equal the present values of\nA's and B's unitrust interests and a proportional share of the\ncharitable remainder interest.  We conclude that, under the\nproposed arrangement, both A and X corp will be grantors of the\nproposed trust. \nSection 301.7701-1(a)(1) of the Procedure and Administration\nRegulations provides that whether an organization is an entity\nseparate from its owners for federal tax purposes is a matter of\nfederal tax law and does not depend on whether the organization\nis recognized as an entity under local law.\nSection 301.7701-1(a)(2) provides that a joint venture or\nother contractual arrangement may create a separate entity for\nfederal tax purposes if the participants carry on a trade,\nbusiness, financial operation, or divide the profits therefrom.   \n  \nSection 301.7701-2(a) provides that a business entity is any\nentity recognized for federal tax purposes (including an entity\nwith a single owner that may be disregarded as an entity separate\nfrom its owner under \u00a7 301.7701-3) that is not properly\nclassified as a trust under \u00a7 301.7701-4 or otherwise subject to\nspecial treatment under the Code.  A business entity with two or \nmore members is classified for federal tax purposes as either a\ncorporation or a partnership. \nSection 301.7701-4(a) provides that, in general, the term\n\"trust\" as used in the Code refers to an arrangement created\neither by a will or by an inter vivos declaration whereby\ntrustees take title to property for the purpose of protecting or\nconserving it for the beneficiaries under the ordinary rules\napplied in chancery or probate court.\nSection 301.7701-4(b) provides that there are other\narrangements which are known as trusts because the legal title to\nproperty is conveyed to trustees for the benefit of\nbeneficiaries, but which are not classified as trusts for the\npurposes of the Internal Revenue Code because they are not simply \narrangements to protect or conserve the property for the\nbeneficiaries.\nSection 301.7701-4(c)(1) provides, in part, that an\n\"investment\" trust will not be classified as a trust if there is\na power under the trust agreement to vary the investment of the\ncertificate holders or if there are multiple classes of ownership\ninterests where the existence of multiple classes of ownership\n4\nMr. Alfred G. Thomsen\n-4-\ninterests is not incidental to the purpose of facilitating direct\ninvestment in the assets of the trust.  See also Commissioner v.\nNorth American Bond Trust, 122 F.2d 545 (2d Cir. 1941), cert.\ndenied, 314 U.S. 701 (1942).\nUnder the proposed arrangement, X corp and A will be treated\nas contributing assets to Y, the proposed trust.  Throughout the\nterm of the proposed trust, the trustee will have the power to\nvary the investment of the grantors by investing and reinvesting\nthe assets in the trust, and as recipients of the unitrust\namount, the grantors will share in the profits derived from the\njoint investment of their assets.  X corp (or its shareholders if\nX corp liquidates) will receive the unitrust interest for a term\nof years, and A and B will receive the unitrust interest after\nthe end of that term.  Such an arrangement is not appropriately\nclassified as a trust under either \u00a7 301.7701-4(a) or (c).\nBecause the proposed trust cannot be classified as a trust\nfor federal income tax purposes, the proposed trust cannot meet\nthe definition of a charitable remainder trust under \u00a7 664(d)(2). \nBecause Y is not a charitable remainder trust, the remaining\nissues raised in X corp\u2019s ruling request are moot.\nExcept as specifically set forth above, no opinion is\nexpressed concerning the federal tax consequences of the facts\ndescribed above under any other provision of the Code.\nThis ruling is directed only to the taxpayer who requested\nit.  Section 6110(k)(3) of the Code provides that it may not be\nused or cited as precedent.\nPursuant to a power of attorney on file with this office, a\ncopy of this letter is being sent to X\u2019s representatives. \n  Sincerely yours,\n  JEANNE M.

The partnerships all have the same general and limited partners.  The limited\npartners, R, S, and T, each own an x interest in A, C, D, E, and F, and a y interest in B. \nThe general partner in the partnerships is Corporation, a State M business corporation. \nCorporation owns a y interest in A, C, D, E, and F, and a z interest in B.\nThe properties owned by the partnerships are mobile home parks, which are real\nproperties improved with the following items:\nA: 173 concrete pads for mobile home sites;\nB: 171 pads for mobile home sites, a single family dwelling which is rented to\nthird parties, a barn, and four additional concrete block structures, three of which\nare leased for the operation of businesses serving the park and the general\npublic, and one is a laundry facility which serves the park residents;\nC: 131 pads for mobile home sites;\nD: 140 pads for mobile home sites;\nE: 103 pads for mobile home sites, and a well and sewage treatment plant,\nwhich provide water and sewerage disposal for the mobile home sites, and a\nstorage rental facility;\nF: 78 mobile home pads and a single family dwelling which is rented to third\nparties.\nTaxpayers also represent that personal property associated with the mobile\nhome parks will be traded in the exchange transactions.\nTaxpayers plan to enter into an exchange agreement with a \u201cQualified\nIntermediary,\u201d in which the above-listed relinquished properties will be transferred to the\nQualified Intermediary, who will sell the relinquished properties and hold the proceeds\n(\u201cexchange funds\u201d).  Taxpayers\u2019 rights to the proceeds will be limited to the\ncircumstances specified in \u00a7 1.1031(k)-1(g)(6) of the Income Tax Regulations. \nTaxpayers will then select replacement properties, which the Qualified Intermediary will\npurchase within the required statutory period, and then transfer to the Taxpayers.  \nTaxpayers have indicated that the as-yet unidentified replacement properties will\nlikely  consist of apartment complexes, and each partnership will own an undivided\ninterest in the replacement properties as tenants in common with the other\npartnerships.  To the extent that the replacement properties require some management\nin order to generate a rental income stream, Corporation will manage the properties,\n3\nPLR-109813-99\nfurnishing only those services which are customary in connection with the rental,\nmaintenance and repair of the properties.\nThe relinquished properties are all subject to mortgages for amounts borrowed\nby the partnerships.  In July, Year 1, Taxpayers refinanced the mortgages to take\nadvantage of lower interest rates, and some of the proceeds of the refinancing were\ndistributed to the partners, who purchased more properties.  It is represented that\nTaxpayers did not contemplate the exchanges at the time of the refinancing; Taxpayers\nwere first approached concerning the exchange transactions in February, Year 2.  It is\nfurther represented that the aggregate amount of mortgages on the replacement\nproperties (the \u201cDebt Amount\u201d) will be greater than or equal to the refinanced\nmortgages on the relinquished properties.\nIt is anticipated that the lenders making the mortgages for the purchase of the\nreplacement properties will require that all of the partnerships be jointly and severally\nliable for those mortgages.  The partnerships will enter into a debt-sharing agreement\nwhich will (i) allocate the risk of loss among the partnerships so as to ensure that the\namount of each partnership\u2019s debt is not reduced by the exchange, (ii) obligate each of\nthe partnerships to make sure its proportional share of payments on the loans is\nsecured by the replacement properties, and (iii) obligate each of the partnerships to\nindemnify the other partnerships against any failure to make such payments.\nRulings Requested\n1.\nThe exchange of the relinquished properties for the replacement\nproperties through the use of a qualified intermediary will not result in the\nconstructive receipt of the exchange funds by the partnerships.\n2.\nThe exchange of the mobile home parks currently owned by the\npartnerships for undivided interests in other income-producing property as\ntenants in common will be an exchange of property of a like kind or class.\n3.\nThe proceeds of the refinancing of the partnerships\u2019 debts in Year 1 will\nnot be considered as payments of boot in the exchange transactions.\n4.\nThe exchange of the relinquished properties for the replacement\nproperties will be an exchange of property for which, under \u00a7 1031(a) of\nthe Code, the partnerships will recognize no gain or loss, except to the\nextent that the exchange funds together with the Debt Amount, exceed\nthe purchase price of the replacement properties; and except to the extent\nthat the value of any personal property included with the relinquished\nproperty exceeds the value of all personal property included with the\nreplacement property.\n4\nPLR-109813-99\n5.\nThe ownership of the replacement properties by the partnerships as\ntenants in common after the completion of the exchanges will not result in\nthe formation of a partnership among the partnerships with respect to the\nownership and operation of the replacement properties.\n6.\nThe joint and several obligation of the partnerships to repay the Debt\nAmount will not result in a reduction in any partner\u2019s share of partnership\ndebt.\nLaw and Analysis\nRulings 1, 2, 3, and 4\nSection 1.1031(a)-1(a) of the regulations provides, in part, that no gain or loss is\nrecognized if property held for productive use in a trade or business or for investment is\nexchanged solely for property of a like kind to be held either for productive use in a\ntrade or business or for investment. \nSection 1.1031(a)-1(b) provides, in part, that as used in \u00a7 1031(a) of the Code,\nthe words \u201clike kind\u201d have reference to the nature or character of the property and not to\nits grade or quality.  One kind or class of property may not, under that section, be\nexchanged for property of a different kind or class.  The fact that any real estate\ninvolved is improved or unimproved is not material, for that fact relates only to the grade\nor quality of the property and not to its kind or class.  Unproductive real estate held by\none other than a dealer for future use or future realization of the increment in value is\nheld for investment and not primarily for sale.\nSection 1.1031(a)-1(c) provides that no gain or loss is recognized if (1) a\ntaxpayer exchanges property held for productive use in his trade or business, together\nwith cash, for other property of like kind for the same use, such as a truck for a new\ntruck or a passenger automobile for a new passenger automobile to be used for a like\npurpose; or (2) a taxpayer who is not a dealer in real estate exchanges city real estate\nfor a ranch or farm, or exchanges a leasehold of a fee with 30 years or more to run for\nreal estate, or exchanges improved real estate for unimproved real estate; or (3) a\ntaxpayer exchanges investment property and cash for investment property of a like\nkind.\nSection 1.1031(a)-2(b) provides that depreciable tangible personal property is\nexchanged for property of a \u201clike kind\u201d under \u00a7 1031 if the property is exchanged for\nproperty of a like kind or like class.  Depreciable tangible personal property is of a like\nkind or class to other depreciable tangible personal property if the exchanged properties\nare either within the same General Asset Class or within the same Product Class.\n5\nPLR-109813-99\nSection 1.1031(j)-1(a) provides, in part, that as a general rule, the application of\n\u00a7 1031 requires a property-by-property comparison for computing the gain recognized\nand basis of property received in a like -kind exchange.  This section provides an\nexception to this general rule in the case of an exchange of multiple properties.  An\nexchange is an exchange of multiple properties if, under paragraph (b)(2) of this\nsection, more than one exchange group is created.  In addition, an exchange is an\nexchange of multiple properties if only one exchange group is created but there is more\nthan one property being transferred or received within that exchange group.\nSection 1.1031(k)-1(a) provides that a deferred exchange is an exchange in\nwhich, pursuant to an agreement, the taxpayer transfers property held for productive\nuse in a trade or business or for investment (the \u201crelinquished property\u201d) and\nsubsequently receives property to be held either for productive use in a trade or\nbusiness or for investment (the \u201creplacement property\u201d).\nSection 1.1031(k)-1(f)(1) provides in part that in the case of a transfer of\nrelinquished property in a deferred exchange, gain or loss may be recognized if the\ntaxpayer actually or constructively receives money or other property before the taxpayer\nactually receives like-kind replacement property.\nSection 1.1031(k)-1(g)(4)(i) provides that when a deferred exchange involves a\nqualified intermediary, the qualified intermediary is not considered an agent of the\ntaxpayer for purposes of \u00a7 1031(a) of the Code.  Thus, the determination of whether the\ntaxpayer is in actual or constructive receipt of money or other property before the\ntaxpayer actually receives like-kind replacement property is made as if the qualified\nintermediary is not the agent of the taxpayer.  Section 1.1031(k)-1(g)(4)(ii) states that\nparagraph (g)(4)(i) applies only if the agreement between the taxpayer and the qualified\nintermediary expressly limits the rights of the taxpayer to receive, pledge, borrow, or\notherwise obtain the benefits of money or other property held by the qualified\nintermediary as provided in \u00a7 1.1031(k)-1(g)(6).\n  \nSection 1.1031(k)-1(g)(4)(iii) provides that a qualified intermediary is a person\nwho is not the taxpayer or a disqualified person (as defined in paragraph (k) of this\nsection), and enters into a written agreement with the taxpayer (the \u201cexchange\nagreement\u201d) and, as required by the exchange agreement, acquires the relinquished\nproperty from the taxpayer, transfers the relinquished property, acquires the\nreplacement property, and transfers the replacement property to the taxpayer.  \nIn Garcia v. Commissioner, 80 T.C. 491 (1983), the owners of the replacement\nproperty were required to obtain another mortgage on the property, which had the effect\nof \u201cevening up\u201d the liabilities on both sides of the exchange.  The court found that the\ntaxpayers\u2019 assumption of this liability as part of the exchange transaction had\nindependent economic significance aside from tax avoidance and, therefore, no boot\nwas recognized by the taxpayers.\n6\nPLR-109813-99\nThe taxpayer in Fredericks v. Commissioner, T.C. Memo. 1994-27, refinanced\nhis mortgage after the exchange agreement was entered into, but before the properties\nwere actually exchanged.  Although the taxpayer received cash from the refinancing,\nthe court held that the receipt of such cash was not considered boot because the\ntaxpayer had reasons for refinancing that were unrelated to the exchange, namely, to\nobtain a lower interest rate and the fact that the original loan was due shortly.\nTaxpayers represent that the relinquished properties are held for investment\npurposes, and are being exchanged for tenancy-in-common interests in apartment\ncomplexes, which will also be held for investment purposes.  Rev. Rul. 73-476, 1973-2\nC.B. 300, holds that the exchange of tenancy-in-common interests in real property for a\nfee simple interest in real property is an exchange of property of a like kind under \u00a7\n1031(a).  Accordingly, we conclude that the relinquished real properties are of a like\nkind to the proposed replacement properties for purposes of \u00a7 1031. \nTo the extent that the partnerships transfer personal property as part of the\nrelinquished property, there will be an exchange of multiple properties under \u00a7\n1.1031(j)-1.  The partnerships should calculate the gain or loss attributable to the\nexchange of the personal property in accordance with the provisions of those\nregulations. \nIn the present case, Taxpayers propose to enter into a deferred exchange. \nTaxpayers represent that the exchange transactions will be accomplished through the\nuse of a qualified intermediary as defined in \u00a7 1.1031(k)-1(g)(4).  Taxpayers represent\nthat after entering into the purchase agreement with the buyer of the relinquished\nproperties, they will transfer their rights under the purchase agreement to the qualified\nintermediary, thereby giving the qualified intermediary the legal title and power to\ntransfer the relinquished properties.  Once the qualified intermediary sells the\nrelinquished property and receives the proceeds, those proceeds will be held by the\nqualified intermediary, and Taxpayers\u2019 rights to receive, pledge, borrow, or otherwise\nobtain the benefits of the proceeds will be limited to those situations specified in \u00a7\n1.1031(k)-1(g)(6).  Accordingly,  the transaction will qualify as a deferred exchange\nrather than a sale of the properties.\nThe refinancing issue in the present case is similar to Fredericks, supra, because\nthe refinancing in Year 1 had an economic significance that is independent from the\nproposed exchange.  Taxpayers received lower interest rates on their loans, and the\nproceeds from the refinancing were used by the partners to purchase more properties. \nAccordingly, the proceeds of the Year 1 refinancing will not be considered as payments\nof boot in the exchange transaction.\n7\nPLR-109813-99\nRulings 5 and 6\nSection 761(a) provides that the term \u201cpartnership\u201d includes a syndicate, group,\npool, joint venture or other unincorporated organization through or by means of which\nany business, financial operation, or venture is carried on, and which is not a\ncorporation or a trust or estate.  \nSection 1.761-1 provides, in part, that the term \u201cpartnership\u201d is broader in scope\nthan the common law meaning of partnership and may include groups not commonly\ncalled partnerships.  See \u00a7 7701(a)(2).  The regulation also provides that mere\ncoownership of property that is maintained, kept in repair, and rented or leased does\nnot constitute a partnership.  Tenants in common may be partners if they actively carry\non a trade, business, financial operation, or venture and divide the profits thereof.  The\nfurnishing of customary services in connection with the maintenance and repair of the\napartments will not render a coownership a partnership.  However, the furnishing of\nadditional services will render a coownership a partnership if the additional services are\nfurnished directly by the coowners or through their agent.  \nIn Rev. Rul. 75-374, 1975-2 C.B. 261, two parties each owned an undivided one-\nhalf interest in an apartment project.  A management company retained by the co-\nowners managed the building.  Customary tenant services such as heat and water,\nunattended parking, trash removal, normal repairs, and cleaning of public areas were\nfurnished at no additional charge.  Additional services, such as attendant parking,\ncabanas, and gas and electricity were provided by the management company for a\nseparate charge.  The ruling holds that the furnishing of customary services in\nconnection with the maintenance and repair of an apartment project will not render a\nco-ownership a partnership.  The furnishing of additional services by the owners or\nthrough an agent will render a co-ownership a partnership.  The revenue ruling\nconcludes that since the management company is not an agent of the owners and the\nowners did not share the income earned from the additional services, the owners were\nnot furnishing services.  Therefore, the owners are to be treated as co-owners and not\npartners under \u00a7 761.\nSection 752(a) provides that any increase in a partner\u2019s share of the liabilities of\na partnership, or any increase in a partner\u2019s individual liabilities by reason of the\nassumption by the partner of the liabilities, is considered a contribution of money by that\npartner to the partnership.  \nSection 752(b) provides that any decrease in a partner\u2019s share of the liabilities of\na partnership, or any decrease in a partner\u2019s individual liabilities by reason of the\nassumption by the partnership of such individual liabilities, shall be considered a\ndistribution of money to that partner by the partnership.  \n8\nPLR-109813-99\nTaxpayers represent that to the extent the replacement properties need to be\nmanaged, they will be managed by Corporation.  In managing any of the properties,\nCorporation will only provide those services which are usual and customary to maintain\nthe replacement properties, such as heat, air conditioning, hot and cold water,\nunattended parking, normal repairs, cleaning of public areas, and trash removal, and\nwill not render additional services.  Based upon such representations, we conclude that\nthe partnerships\u2019 ownership and operation of the replacement properties as tenants in\ncommon will not be treated as a partnership or as an association taxable as a\ncorporation for federal income tax purposes.     \nWith respect to the repayment of the Debt Amount, Taxpayers represent that the\nindebtedness outstanding with respect to each partnership before the \u00a7 1031 exchange\nis considered recourse indebtedness (within the meaning of \u00a7 1.752-2) with respect to\nthe partnership.  The partnerships will enter into a debt agreement whereby each\npartnership will be liable for its proportionate share of payments on the mortgage and\nwill be indemnified by the other partnerships to the extent that it pays more than its\nproportionate share.  \nFurther, Taxpayers represent that each partnership\u2019s portion of the debt will\nobligate the partnership in an amount at least equal to the amount of liabilities for which\nthe partnership was liable before the exchange and acquisition of the replacement\nproperties.  Accordingly, we also conclude that the joint and several obligation of the\npartnerships to repay the Debt Amount will not result in a reduction in any partner\u2019s\nshare of partnership debt.  \nConclusions\nBased upon Taxpayers\u2019 representations and the above analysis, we rule as\nfollows:\n1.\nThe exchange of the relinquished properties for the replacement\nproperties through the use of a qualified intermediary will not result in the\nconstructive receipt of the exchange funds by the partnerships.\n2.\nThe exchange of the fee simple interests in the real and personal property\ncomprising the mobile home parks to be relinquished by the partnerships\nfor undivided interests in other real and personal property represented to\nbe of a like kind or class to be held as tenants in common will qualify as a\nlike-kind exchange under \u00a7 1031.\n3.\nThe proceeds of the refinancing of the partnerships\u2019 debts in Year 1 will\nnot be considered as payments of boot in the exchange transactions.\n9\nPLR-109813-99\n4.\nThe exchange of the relinquished properties for the replacement\nproperties will be an exchange of property for which, under \u00a7 1031(a), the\npartnerships will recognize no gain or loss, except to the extent that the\nsum of the proceeds from the relinquished properties and the Debt\nAmount exceeds the purchase price of the replacement properties, and\nexcept as provided in \u00a7 1.1031(j)-1.\n5.\nThe ownership of the replacement properties by the partnerships as\ntenants in common after the completion of the exchanges will not result in\nthe formation of a partnership among the partnerships with respect to the\nownership and operation of the replacement properties.\n6.\nThe joint and several obligation of the partnerships to repay the Debt\nAmount will not result in a reduction in any partner\u2019s share of partnership\ndebt.\nExcept as expressly provided herein, no opinion is expressed or implied\nconcerning the tax consequences of any aspect of any transaction or item discussed or\nreferenced in this letter.\nThis ruling is directed only to the taxpayers requesting it.  Section 6110(k)(3) of\nthe Code provides that it may not be used or cited as precedent.

Additional information was submitted in a letter dated November 30, 1999. \nThe information submitted is summarized below.\nAcquiring is a State A corporation engaged in Business X.  Acquiring is a publicly\ntraded corporation that is the common parent of a consolidated group of corporations\nwhich includes Target.   Acquiring has only common stock outstanding.  Acquiring files\nits federal consolidated income tax returns on the calendar year using the accrual\nmethod of accounting.\nAcquiring Sub was a State A corporation organized by Acquiring solely for the\npurpose of acquiring Target.  Acquiring Sub conducted no business or operations\nexcept those necessary to facilitate the transaction.  Before the Acquisition Merger,\ndescribed below, Acquiring owned all of the stock of Acquiring Sub.    \n- 2 -\nPLR-114034-99\nPrior to the Acquisition Merger, Target, a State A corporation, was also engaged\nin Business X.   Target had only common stock outstanding.  Target filed its federal \nincome tax return on the calendar year using the accrual method of accounting.  Target\nwas neither the common parent of nor a member of a consolidated group.\nOn Date 1, the management of Acquiring and Target entered into an agreement\nto combine the businesses of the two companies.  Both Acquiring and Target believed\nthat to maximize the benefits of a combination of the companies, a fast and efficient\nintegration was necessary.  However, while management would have preferred to\nmerge Target directly into Acquiring, this type of combination was not possible because\nTarget had significant contracts which required careful review and analysis to determine\nwhich contracts could be assigned.\nTherefore, on Date 2, pursuant to State A law and in accordance with a plan of\nreorganization, Acquiring Sub merged with and into Target (the \u201cAcquisition Merger\u201d). \nTarget survived the merger and Target shareholders received shares of Acquiring stock\nin exchange for their Target stock.   Now, Acquiring proposes to merge Target with and\ninto Acquiring (the \u201cUpstream Merger\u201d).  \nThe taxpayer has made the following representations in connection with the\nproposed transaction:\n(1)\nThe Acquisition Merger, viewed independently of the proposed Upstream\nMerger, qualified as a reorganization under \u00a7 368(a)(1)(A) by reason of   \u00a7\n368(a)(2)(E).\n(2)\nThe proposed Upstream Merger will qualify as a statutory merger under\napplicable state law and, viewed independently of the Acquisition Merger,\nwould qualify under \u00a7 332. \n(3)\nIf the Acquisition Merger had not occurred and Target had merged directly\ninto Acquiring, such merger would have qualified as a reorganization\nunder \u00a7 368(a)(1)(A).  \n(4)\nAcquiring has no plan or intention to sell or otherwise dispose of any of\nTarget\u2019s assets received in the proposed Upstream Merger, except for\ndispositions in the ordinary course of business, or transfers described in\n\u00a7 368(a)(2)(C) or the regulations thereunder.\nPursuant to \u00a7 3.01(23) of Rev. Proc. 99-3, 1999-1 I.R.B. 103, 106, the Internal\nRevenue Service will not rule as to whether a proposed transaction qualifies under      \n\u00a7 368(a)(1)(A).  However, the Service has the discretion to rule on significant subissues\nthat must be resolved to determine whether a transaction qualifies under                        \n- 3 -\nPLR-114034-99\n\u00a7 368(a)(1)(A).\nBased solely on the information submitted and the representations made, and\nprovided that (i) the Acquisition Merger and the Upstream Merger are treated as steps\nin an integrated plan pursuant to the step-transaction doctrine, and (ii) the Acquisition\nMerger and the Upstream Merger qualify as statutory mergers under applicable state\nlaw, we hold as follows:\nFor federal income tax purposes, the Acquisition Merger and the Upstream\nMerger will be treated as if Acquiring directly acquired the Target assets in\nexchange for Acquiring stock and the assumption of Target liabilities through a\n\u201cstatutory merger\u201d as that term is used in \u00a7 368(a)(1)(A).  See Rev. Rul. 67-274,\n1967-2 C.B. 141 and Rev. Rul. 72-405, 1972-2 C.B. 217.\nWe express no opinion regarding whether the Acquisition Merger and the\nUpstream Merger are steps in an integrated plan or whether the Acquisition Merger and\nUpstream Merger qualify as a reorganization under \u00a7 368(a)(1)(A).  Additionally, we\nexpress no opinion about the tax treatment of the proposed transaction under other\nprovisions of the Code and regulations or about the tax treatment of any conditions\nexisting at the time of, or effects resulting from, the proposed transaction that are not\nspecifically covered by the above rulings.\nThis ruling is directed only to the taxpayers on whose behalf it was requested. \nSection 6110(k)(3) provides that it may not be used or cited as precedent.\nEach affected taxpayer should attach a copy of this letter to its federal income\ntax return for the taxable year in which the transaction covered by this ruling letter is\nconsummated.\nIn accordance with the power of attorney on file this office, copies of this letter\nare being sent to your authorized representatives.\nSincerely yours,\nAssistant Chief Counsel (Corporate) \n      By \n           \nChief, Branch 3\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Non-Adverse"}]}

Spouse is its sole \ntrustee. \n2 \n201430029 \nBased on the facts and representations, you request that the Internal Revenue Service \nissue the following rulings: \n1. \nIRA X does not constitute an inherited IRA within the meaning of Code \nsection 408(d)(3)(C) with respect to Spouse; \n2. \nSpouse is eligible to rollover or transfer (by means of a trustee-to-trustee \ntransfer) the funds in IRA X into an IRA established in Spouse's own \nname; and \n3. \nSpouse will not be required to include in gross income for federal income \ntax purposes for the year in which amounts are distributed from IRA X and \nthe year in which the above referenced rollover is made (if different) any \nportion of the amounts distributed from IRA X and contributed to the \nindividual retirement account set up and maintained in Spouse's name, \nprovided that the rollover of such distribution occurs no later than the 60th \nday from the date on which IRA X proceeds are distributed from IRA X to \nTrust T. \nSection 408( d)( 1) of the Code provides that, except as otherwise provided in section \n408(d), any amount paid or distributed out of an IRA shall be included in gross income \nby the payee or distributee, as the case may be, in the manner provided under section \n72 of the Code. \nSection 408(d)(3) of the Code defines and provides the rules applicable to IRA rollovers. \nSection 408( d)(3)(A) of the Code provides that section 408( d)( 1) of the Code does not \napply to any amount paid or distributed out of an IRA to the individual for whose benefit \nthe IRA is maintained if-\n(i) the entire amount received (including money and any other property) is paid \ninto an IRA for the benefit of such individual not later than the 60th day after the \nday on which the individual receives the payment or distribution; or \n(ii) the entire amount received (including money and any other property) is paid \ninto an eligible retirement plan (other than an IRA) for the benefit of such \nindividual not later than the 60th day after the date on which the payment or \ndistribution is received, except that the maximum amount which may be paid into \nsuch plan may not exceed the portion of the amount received which is includible \nin gross income (determined without regard to section 408(d)(3)). \nSection 408(d)(3)(C)(i) of the Code provides, in summary, that the rollover rules of \nsection 408(d)(3) do not apply to inherited IRAs. \n3 \n201430029 \nSection 408(d)(3)(C)(ii) of the Code provides that the term \"inherited IRA\" means an \nIRA obtained by an individual, other than the IRA owner's spouse, as a result of the \ndeath of the IRA owner. \nSection 1.408-8 of the Income Tax Regulations, Question and Answer 5 provides that a \nsurviving spouse of an IRA owner may elect to treat the spouse's entire interest as a \nbeneficiary in an individual's IRA as the spouse's own IRA. In order to make this \nelection, the spouse must be the sole beneficiary of the IRA and have an unlimited right \nto withdraw amounts from the IRA. If a trust is named as beneficiary of the IRA, this \nrequirement is not satisfied even if the spouse is the sole beneficiary of the trust. \nIn this case, Decedent designated Trust T as the beneficiary of IRA X. Decedent's \nsurviving spouse, Spouse, is sole trustee of Trust T and has the right, as its settlor and \none of its beneficiaries, to withdraw all or any portion of its principal and/or its net \nincome at any time. \nSpouse intends to distribute the proceeds of IRA X to herself as beneficiary of Trust T, \nand to then rollover the distribution to an IRA maintained in her own name. \nGenerally, if the proceeds of a decedent's IRA are payable to a trust, and are paid to its \ntrustee, who then pays them to the decedent's surviving spouse as the beneficiary of \nthe trust, the surviving spouse is treated as having received the IRA proceeds from the \ntrust and not from the decedent. Accordingly, such surviving spouse, in general, is not \neligible to roll over the distributed IRA proceeds into her own IRA. \nHowever, the general rule will not apply where the surviving spouse is the sole trustee \nof the decedent's trust and has the sole authority and discretion under its language to \ndistribute the IRA proceeds to herself. The surviving spouse may then receive the IRA \nproceeds and roll over the amounts into an IRA set up and maintained in her name. \nTherefore, with respect to your ruling requests, we conclude as follows: \n1. IRA X will not be treated as an inherited IRA within the meaning of section \n408(d) of the Code with respect to Spouse; \n2. Spouse is eligible to roll over or transfer, by means of a trustee to \ntrustee transfer, a distribution of the proceeds of IRA X into an IRA set up and \nmaintained in her own name, as long as the rollover of such distribution \noccurs no later than the 60th day from the date such distribution is made from \nIRA X; and \n3. Spouse will not be required to include in gross income for federal income tax \npurposes for the year in which the amounts are distributed from IRA X and \nthe year in which the above referenced rollover is made (if different) any \nportion of the amounts distributed from IRA X and contributed to the individual \nretirement account set up and maintained in Spouse's name, provided that \n4 \n201430029 \nthe rollover of such distribution occurs no later than the 60th day from the \ndate on which the IRA X proceeds are distributed from IRA X to Trust T. \nThis ruling does not authorize the rollover of amounts that are required to be distributed \nby section 408(a)(6) of the Code, \nNo opinion is expressed as to the tax treatment of the transaction described in this \nruling under the provisions of any other section of either the Code or regulations which \nmay be applicable. \nThis letter is based on the assumption that IRA X met the requirements of section 408 \nof the Code at all relevant times, and that Trust T is valid under applicable state law. It \nalso assumes that any rollover IRA established by Spouse will also meet the \nrequirements of section 408 at all relevant times. \nPursuant to a power of attorney on file with this office, a copy of this letter ruling is being \nsent to your authorized representative. \nThis ruling is directed only to the taxpayer who requested it. Section 611 O(k)(3) of the \nCode provides that it may not be used or cited by others as precedent. \nIf you wish to inquire about this ruling, please contact XXXX at (XXX) XXX-XXXX. \nPlease address all correspondence to SE:T:EP:RA:T3. \nSincerely, \nLaura B.

Number 2 of those \nentities each own an automobile dealership.  Number 3 entity is a holding company that \nowns all of the ownership entities in Number 4 entities, each of which separately own an \nautomobile dealership.  Individual has Number 8 percent ownership of one of the \ndealerships and the holding company.  Individual owns Number 5 percent of the \nownership interest in another dealership and Number 6 percent of the ownership in \nNumber 7 of the remaining dealerships.  The dealerships are located in State A, State \nB, and State C. \n \nTaxpayer is a corporation organized under the laws of State A.  Taxpayer will not \nbe licensed as an insurance company in States A, B, and C, the states in which it will \nissue ESAs.  In order to comply with state law in State A and State B, Taxpayer will \ninsure its obligations under the ESAs with an unrelated commercial insurer.  Taxpayer \nwill also insure its obligations under ESAs issued in State C even though State C law \nmay not require such insurance.   \n \nTaxpayer is currently negotiating the purchase of an insurance policy from a \ncommercial insurance company.  To obtain this policy, Taxpayer will have to have an \ninitial capital of approximately Amount 1.  Taxpayer anticipates that Individual will \nprovide the initial capital.  Additionally, Taxpayer will be required to either maintain loss \nreserves in a trust account or establish a line of credit in the amount specified by the \ncommercial insurance company.  The commercial insurance company will also require \nTaxpayer to follow an investment policy that restricts the investment of loss reserves.  If \nTaxpayer is unable to obtain an insurance policy from this commercial insurer, it \nexpects to obtain an insurance policy from another commercial insurance company with \nsimilar security requirements.  Taxpayer represents that more than half of its business \nwill constitute the issuance of ESAs. \n \nPLR-131228-07 \n \n \n3 \n \nThe ESAs will indemnify the ESA holder against economic loss for certain repair \nexpenses resulting from vehicle breakdowns, but only if the expenses are not covered \nby the manufacturer\u2019s warranty.  Under certain circumstances, the ESAs will also \nindemnify the ESA holder against part of the cost of towing and substitute transportation \nnecessitated by the vehicle breakdown.  The ESAs will be offered both for new and \nused cars sold by Individual\u2019s dealership, as well as other dealerships. \n \nThe ESAs will not indemnify the contract holder for any of the following: (1) \nexpenses related to routine or preventive maintenance, such as oil changes and other \nperiodic services; (2) losses normally covered by casualty insurance, including losses \nattributable to accidents, floods, fire, and vandalism; (3) losses attributable to improper \nuse of the vehicle, e.g. commercial use; (4) incidental and consequential damages \nattributable to improper use of the vehicle, e.g. commercial use; (5) incidental and \nconsequential damages attributable to vehicle breakdown, except for part of the cost of \nsubstitute transportation and towing.  Additionally, the ESAs limit the aggregate amount \npayable under the contract to the price paid for the vehicle. \n \nThe customer will select from available options the maximum months and the \nmaximum mileage covered by the ESA.  The available options will depend on the \nvehicle\u2019s make, model and type (i.e. new or used).  The term of the ESA will end upon \nthe earlier of the expiration of its maximum number of months or miles. \n \nFor repairs to be covered under the ESA, the ESAs generally will require the \nESA holder to return to the selling dealership to have the repairs made.  The ESAs, \nhowever, will permit the ESA holder to take the vehicle to another repair facility (1) for \nemergency repairs, as defined in the ESAs; or (2) if the vehicle is located more than \nforty miles from the selling dealership, or the selling dealership has moved, and the ESA \nholder obtains authorization.  The price that the dealership will charge for repairs under \nthe ESAs will be the same as that charged for comparable work performed by unrelated \nparties. \n \nWhen the dealership sells an ESA, it will collect the full purchase price and remit \na predetermined portion to Taxpayer or to an unrelated administrator hired by Taxpayer, \nretaining the rest as commission.  If the dealership remits the purchase price to an \nadministrator, the administrator will deduct an administrative fee and remit the \nremainder to Taxpayer.  Otherwise, Taxpayer will pay the administrative fee after it \nreceives payment from the dealership.  When the ESA holder obtains covered repairs, \nTaxpayer will reimburse either the repair facility or the ESA holder.  Additionally, \nTaxpayer may make payments to affiliated entities for management, administrative, \nand/or other services. \n \nIf the covered vehicle is repossessed or declared a total loss or if an ESA holder \ncancels the ESA prior to its expiration date, Taxpayer will issue a refund.  Generally, the \n \nPLR-131228-07 \n \n \n4 \namount of the refund is determined by a formula, and represents the unexpired portion \nof the purchase price.  When permitted by state law, Taxpayer will deduct a small \nadministrative fee. \n \nTaxpayer\u2019s business will consist of issuing ESAs.  Taxpayer may perform \nservices related to the ESAs such as processing fees, tracking claims, investing \npremiums and assisting the dealerships in marketing the ESA contracts.  Taxpayer will \nnot perform any repair services.  Taxpayer expects for each year in which it operates, \nits gross receipts from issuing ESAs will constitute a substantial majority of its gross \nreceipts. \n \nLAW AND ANALYSIS \n \nSection 831(a) provides that taxes, as computed under section 11, will be \nimposed on the taxable income (as defined by section 832) of each insurance company \nother than a life insurance company.  Section 831(c) defines the term \u201cinsurance \ncompany,\u201d for purposes of the section, as having the same meaning as the term is \ngiven under section 816(a).  Section 816(a) provides that the term \u201cinsurance company\u201d \nmeans any company more than half of the business of which during the taxable year is \nthe issuing of insurance or annuity contracts or the reinsuring of risks underwritten by \ninsurance companies. \n \nSection 1.831-3(a) of the Income Tax Regulations provides that for purposes of \nsection 831 and 832, the term \u201cinsurance company\u201d means only those companies that \nqualify as insurance companies under the definition of former section 1.801-1(b) (now \nsection 1.801-3(a)(1)). \n \nSection 1.801-3(a)(1) provides that although the company\u2019s name, charter \npowers, and subjection to state insurance laws are significant in determining the \nbusiness that a company is authorized and intends to carry on, it is the character of the \nbusiness actually done in the taxable year that determines whether the company is \ntaxable as an insurance company under the Internal Revenue Code.  See also, Bowers \nv. Lawyers Mortgage Co., 285 U.S. 182, 188 (1932) (to the same effect as the \nregulation); Rev. Rul. 83-172, 1983-2 C.B. 107 (holding that taxpayer was an insurance \ncompany as defined in section 1.801-3(a)(1), notwithstanding that taxpayer was not \nrecognized as an insurance company for state law purposes).  To qualify as an \ninsurance company, a taxpayer \u201cmust use its capital and efforts primarily in earning \nincome from the issuance of contracts of insurance.\u201d Indus. Life Ins. v. United States, \n344 F. Supp. 870, 877 (D.S.C. 1972), aff\u2019d per curiam, 481 F. 2d 609 (4th Cir. 1973), \ncert. denied, 414 U.S. 1143 (1974).  To determine whether a taxpayer qualifies as an \ninsurance company, all relevant facts will be considered, including but not limited to, the \nsize and activities of its staff, whether it engages in other trades or businesses, and its \nsources of income. See generally, Bowers, 285 U.S. 182, Indus. Life Ins. Co., at 875-\n77; Cardinal Life Ins. Co. v. United States, 300 F. Supp. 387, 391-92 (N.D. Tex. 1969), \n \nPLR-131228-07 \n \n \n5 \nrev\u2019d on other grounds, 293 F. 2d 72 (8th Cir. 1961); Inter-Am. Life Ins. Co. v. \nCommissioner, 56 T.C. 497, 506-08 (1971), aff\u2019d per curiam, 469 F 2d 697 (9th Cir. \n1971); Nat\u2019l Capital Ins. Co. of the Dist. of Columbia v. Commissioner, 28 B.T.A. 1079, \n1085-86 (1933).   \n \nNeither the Code nor the regulations thereunder define the term \u201cinsurance\u201d or \n\u201cinsurance contract.\u201d  The accepted definition of \u201cinsurance for federal income tax \npurposes relates back to Helvering v. Le Gierse, 312 U.S. 531, 539 (1941), in which the \nSupreme Court stated that \u201c[h]istorically and commonly insurance involves risk-shifting \nand risk-distributing.\u201d  Case law has defined \u201cinsurance\u201d as \u201cinvolv[ing] a contract, \nwhereby, for adequate consideration, one party undertakes to indemnify another against \nloss arising from certain specified contingencies or perils\u2026 [I]t is contractual security \nagainst possible anticipated loss.\u201d See, Epmeier v. United States, 199 F. 2d 508, 509-\n10 (7th Cir. 1952).  In addition, the risk transferred must be risk of economic loss.  Allied \nFidelity Corp. v. Commissioner, 572 F. 2d 1190, 1193 (7th Cir. 1978), cert. denied, 439 \nU.S. 835 (1978).  The risk must contemplate the fortuitous occurrence of a stated \ncontingency.  Commissioner v. Treganowan, 183 F. 2d 288, 290-291 (2d Cir. 1950), \nand must not be merely an investment or business risk.  Le Gierse, 312 U.S. at 542; \nRev. Rul. 89-96, 189-2 C.B. 114, as amplified by Rev. Rul. 2007-47, 2007-30 I.R.B. \n127. \n \nRisk shifting occurs if a person facing the possibility of an economic loss \ntransfers some or all of the financial consequences of the potential loss to the insurer.  \nSee Rev. Rul. 92-93, 1992-2 C.B. 45 (when parent corporation purchased a group-term \nlife insurance policy from its wholly owned insurance subsidiary, the arrangement was \nnot held to be \u201cself-insurance\u201d because the risk of economic loss was not that of the \nparent), modified on other grounds, Rev. Rul. 2001-31, 2001-1 C.B. 1348.  If the insured \nhas shifted its risk to the insurer, then a loss by the insured does not affect the insured \nbecause the loss is offset by the insurance payment.  See Clougherty Packing Co. v. \nCommissioner, 811 F. 2d 1297, 1300 (9th Cir. 1987). \n \nRisk distribution incorporates the statistical phenomenon known as the law of \nlarge numbers.  Distributing risk allows the insurer to reduce the possibility that a single \ncostly claim will exceed the amount taken as premiums and set aside for the payment of \nsuch claim.  Insuring many independent risks in return for numerous premiums serves \nto distribute risk.  By assuming numerous, relatively small, independent risks that occur \nrandomly over time, the insurer can smooth out losses to match more closely its receipt \nof premiums.  See Clougherty Packing Co. v. Commissioner, 811 F. 2d at 1300. \n \nThe \u201ccommonly accepted sense\u201d of insurance derives from all the facts \nsurrounding each case, with emphasis on comparing the implementation of the \narrangement with that known insurance.  Court opinions identify several nonexclusive \nfactors bearing on this, such as the treatment of an arrangement under the applicable \nstate law.  AMERCO v. Commissioner, 96 T.C. 18, 41 (1991); the adequacy of the \n \nPLR-131228-07 \n \n \n6 \ninsurer\u2019s capitalization and utilization of premiums priced at arm\u2019s length.  The Harper \nGroup v. Commissioner, 96 T.C. 45, 60 (1991), aff\u2019d, 979 F. 2d 1341 (9th Cir. 1992); \nseparately maintained funds to pay claims.  Ocean Drilling & Exploration Co. v. United \nStates, 24 Cl. Ct. 714, 728 (1991)., aff\u2019d per curiam, 988 F. 2d 1134 (Fed. Cir. 1993); \nand the language of the operative agreements and the method of resolving claims, \nKidde Indus. Inc. v. United States, 49 Fed. Cl. 42, 51-52 (1997). \n \nA contract providing benefits in kind, rather than cash, may constitute an \ninsurance contract for federal income tax purposes.  Commissioner v. W.H. Luquire \nBurial Ass\u2019n Co., 102 F. 2d 89, 90 (5th Cir. 1939); section 1.213-1(e)(4). \n \nBased on the information submitted, we conclude that Taxpayer\u2019s ESAs are \ninsurance contracts for federal income tax purposes.  The ESAs are aleatory contracts \nunder which Taxpayer, for a fixed price, is obligated to indemnify the contract holder for \ncertain economic losses, which are not covered by the manufacturer\u2019s or dealer\u2019s \nwarranty, that result from the vehicle\u2019s mechanical breakdown.  Thus, during the \ncontract period, the contract holder has limited its loss for covered risks to the payment \nof the contract purchase price.  In this way, each contract holder has shifted the risk of \neconomic loss to the Taxpayer.  By issuing ESAs to a large number of contract holders, \nTaxpayers will assume numerous, independent, and homogenous risks.  Taxpayer will \nhave distributed the risk of loss under the ESAs so as to make the average loss \npredictable. \n \nBased upon Taxpayer\u2019s representation concerning its business activities, we find \nthat more than half of Taxpayer\u2019s business will be issuing ESAs that are insurance \ncontracts for federal income tax purposes.  Therefore, Taxpayer will qualify as an \n\u201cinsurance company\u201d for purposes of section 831. \n \n \n \n \n \nCONCLUSIONS \n \n(1) Taxpayer\u2019s ESAs, as described above, are insurance contracts for federal \nincome tax purposes. \n \n(2) Taxpayer will be taxable as an insurance company under section 831(a) as \nlong as half of its business consists of issuing ESAs. \n \nExcept as expressly provided herein, no opinion is expressed or implied \nconcerning the tax consequences of any aspect or item referenced in this letter. \n \nThe rulings contained in this letter are base upon the information and \nrepresentations submitted by the Taxpayer and accompanied by a penalty of perjury \nstatement executed by an appropriate party.  While this office has not verified any of the \nmaterial submitted in support of the request for rulings, it is subject to verification on \nexamination. \n \nPLR-131228-07 \n \n \n7 \n \nThe ruling is directed only to the taxpayer requesting it.

For the reasons set forth below, we conclude that Entity is \nrequired to report the discharge of indebtedness because of the occurrence of an \nidentifiable event listed in Treasury Regulation section 1.6050P-1(b)(2).\nFacts\nEntity is a financial institution chartered in State X engaged in, among other things, \npurchasing conditional sales contracts entered into in State X by buyers and sellers of \nAssets that are subject to State Law X.  Some of these contracts went into default and \nEntity pursued Collection Remedy.  Plaintiff filed a class action lawsuit against Entity, \nalleging Entity\u2019s Notices violated State Law X, and seeking statutory damages and an \ninjunction prohibiting Entity from collecting the outstanding deficiency balances from the \nclass of debtors who received similar Notices.  \nEntity and plaintiffs signed an agreement in Month of Year 1.  Pursuant to a settlement \nagreement, Entity will waive and extinguish the balances owed by the class members.  \nEntity will also acknowledge that the Notices sent to class members did not meet \nstatutory standards and admit that State X law bars entity from collecting deficiency \nbalances. \nLaw & Analysis\nSection 6050P of the Internal Revenue Code requires that an applicable entity report \nany discharge (in whole or in part) of indebtedness of any person in excess of $600 on \na Form 1099-C.  The Form 1099-C is to include the name, address and taxpayer \nidentification number of the person whose indebtedness is discharged, the date of the \ndischarge and the amount of indebtedness discharged.  Section 1.6050P-1(a)(1) of the \nTreasury Regulations provides that, for information reporting purposes, a discharge of \nindebtedness is deemed to have occurred upon the occurrence of an \u201cidentifiable \nevent\u201d, whether or not an actual discharge of indebtedness has occurred on or before \nthe date on which the identifiable event has occurred.  Section 1.6050P-1(b)(2) provides \na list of identifiable events.  There is a reporting requirement upon the occurrence of \none of these identifiable events even if the identifiable event did not cause the \ndischarge.  Of the identifiable events, two are particularly relevant to the requested \nruling: agreement by the parties to discharge the debt for less than full consideration or \na decision by the creditor to discontinue collection activity and discharge the debt.  \nDischarge by agreement of the parties\nTreasury Regulation section 1.6050P-1(b)(2)(F) provides that an identifiable event \noccurs when the applicable entity and debtor agree to discharge the indebtedness for \nless than full consideration.   Here, pursuant to the settlement agreement between \nPLR-103304-15\n3\nEntity and the class members, Entity will discharge the class members\u2019 remaining \nindebtedness for less than full consideration.  Entity is required to report the discharges \nof the class members\u2019 indebtedness because there is an agreement between the \ncreditor and the debtor to discharge indebtedness for less than full consideration. \nDischarge by decision of the creditor\nTreasury Regulation section 1.6050P-1(b)(2)(G) provides that a discharge of \nindebtedness occurs upon a decision by the creditor, or the application of a defined \npolicy of the creditor, to discontinue collection activity and discharge debt.   Because the \nidentifiable event listed in Treasury Regulation section 1.6050P-1(b)(2)(F) occurred,  \nreporting is required without a need for further analysis.    \nConclusion\nBased solely on the information provided and representations made, we conclude that \nEntity is required to file Forms 1099-C with respect to waiving and extinguishing the \nclass members\u2019 deficiency balances pursuant to the settlement agreement and \npreliminary order because the identifiable event described in section 1.6050P-1(b)(2)(F) \noccurred. \nExcept as expressly provided herein, no opinion is expressed or implied concerning the \ntax consequences of any aspect of any transaction or item discussed or referenced in \nthis letter.\nThis ruling is directed only to the taxpayer requesting it.

A corporate trustee located in State 1 is Trustee of Trust.  Trust is \ninitially governed under the law of State 1 and Grantor resides in State 2.  Trust is a \nUnited States person under \u00a7 7701(a)(30)(E) of the Internal Revenue Code.  \n \nPart III, Article THIRD of the Trust provides for the creation of a Power of Appointment \nCommittee. The initial members of the Power of Appointment Committee are Grantor, \nNephew, Niece 1, Guardian, and Friend.  Guardian is acting on behalf of Niece 2, who \nis a minor.  If at any time the Power of Appointment Committee includes three or more \nmembers, other than the Grantor, then all the members of the Power of Appointment \nCommittee including the Grantor may by unanimous vote, at any time and from time to \ntime, add one or more members to Power of Appointment Committee provided that \nsuch members are Beneficiaries (i.e., descendants of Nephew, Niece 1, or Niece 2) \nand, provided further that, if any one or more of them is a minor, the members of the \nPower of Appointment Committee shall by unanimous vote designate an individual to \nserve as guardian for such minor.  Each member of the Power of Appointment \nCommittee may resign without prior approval of any court or the consent of any person.  \nIf such a member resigns or fails or ceases to serve, then the position will remain \nvacant.  The members of the Power of Appointment Committee shall not serve or act in \na fiduciary capacity.  Under Part III, Article FOURTH(d) and (g), under no circumstances \nshall Grantor or any of the Beneficiaries act as a guardian and upon the beneficiary \nattaining age eighteen years, his or her guardian shall cease to serve and the \nbeneficiary shall serve as a member of the Power of Appointment Committee. \n \nPart II, Article THIRD of the Trust provides that the Power of Appointment Committee \nshall cease to exist upon the first to occur of the date of the Grantor\u2019s death or the date \non which the Power of Appointment Committee has fewer than two (2) members other \nthan the Grantor.  \n \nPart I, Article FIRST(a)(1) and Part III, Article THIRD(f) of Trust provides that while the \nPower of Appointment Committee is in existence, then, until the Distribution Date \n(defined as the date of Grantor\u2019s death) at any time or times, Trustee shall distribute to \nthe Beneficiaries and/or Grantor such amounts of net income and principal (including \nthe whole thereof) as the Power of Appointment Committee appoints.  While the Power \nof Appointment Committee is in existence, Trust shall make no distributions except as \n \nPLR-103339-19 \n \n3 \nthe Power of Appointment Committee appoints.  Any appointment to one or more \nBeneficiaries and/or Grantor must be made in writing either: \n \n(1) as executed by Grantor and by a majority of the Committee members (Grantor\u2019s \nConsent Power); or  \n(2) as executed by all then serving members of Committee (Unanimous Member \nPower). \n \nIn addition, any appointment to Grantor may also be made in writing, executed by any \none member of the Committee who is also an Adverse Party (Adverse Party Power).  \nAdverse Party is defined in Part II, Article FIRST(c) as having the meaning set forth in \n\u00a7 672(a) of the Internal Revenue Code. \n \nThe Power of Appointment Committee may appoint income or principal equally or \nunequally to or for the benefit of Grantor or any one or more of the Beneficiaries to the \nexclusion of others.   \n \nPart I, Article FIRST(b)(1) provides that if and only if the Power of Appointment \nCommittee is in existence, Grantor shall have the power in a non-fiduciary capacity, at \nany time and from time to time, to appoint to any one or more of the Beneficiaries such \namounts of the principal (including the whole thereof) as Grantor deems advisable to \nprovide for the health, maintenance, support and education of the Beneficiaries \n(Grantor\u2019s First Sole Power). \n \nPart I, Article FIRST(a)(2), (a)(3), and (b)(2) provide that if and only if the Power of \nAppointment Committee ceases to exist, then, until the Distribution Date: \n \n(1) Trustee may, pursuant to a written instrument, at any time or times, distribute to \nthe Beneficiaries such amounts of the net income or principal of Trust (including \nthe whole thereof) as Trustee determines.  In determining whether to make any \ndistributions to the Beneficiaries, Trustee is required to take into consideration \nthe distributee\u2019s own income and property and any other income or property \nwhich any individual provides or is obligated to provide; \n(2) Trustee may, with and only with the consent of an Adverse Party, distribute to \nGrantor such amounts of the net income or principal of Trust (including the whole \nthereof) as Trustee determines; \n(3) Grantor shall have the power in a non-fiduciary capacity, at any time and from \ntime to time, to appoint such amounts of the net income or principal of Trust \n(including the whole thereof) to any one or more of the Grantor\u2019s Family, other \nthan Grantor, Grantor\u2019s estate, Grantor\u2019s creditors or the creditors of Grantor\u2019s \nestate (Grantor\u2019s Second Sole Power).  Grantor\u2019s Family is defined in Part II, \nArticle FIRST(q) as the Grantor, the issue of the Grantor\u2019s grandparents, all \nClose Persons and all charities.  A Close Person is defined in Part II, Article \nFIRST(j) as an individual determined by the Trustee to be a close personal, \nbusiness or professional associate of the Grantor and each of the issue of any \n \nPLR-103339-19 \n \n4 \nsuch individual other than any such issue who is expressly excluded by the \nTrustee.       \n \nAdditionally, under Part I, Article FIRST(a)(1) and (c)(1) the Power of Appointment \nCommittee and Trustee have the power, until the Distribution Date, to appoint all or any \nportion of Trust to any one or more Qualified Trusts.  Part II, Article FIRST(dd) defines a \nQualified Trust as a trust that benefits one or more members of the Grantor\u2019s Family \nand complies with certain other technical requirements.  The Power of Appointment \nCommittee may exercise this power under the Grantor\u2019s Consent Power, the \nUnanimous Member Power, and the Adverse Party Power. \n \nUnder Part II, Article THIRD(a), no distribution by Trustee to a beneficiary and no \ndistributions to a beneficiary pursuant to a power of appointment granted hereunder, \nshall discharge any individual\u2019s legal obligation to support the beneficiary. \n \nPart II, Article EIGHTH(j)(2) provides that any power retained by Grantor shall be \nexercisable in a non-fiduciary capacity. \n \nPart I, Article FIRST(e) provides that upon the death of the Grantor, Trustee shall \ndistribute the remainder of the trust to or for the benefit of any person or entity or \nentities, other than the Grantor\u2019s estate, the Grantor\u2019s creditors, or the creditors of the \nGrantor\u2019s estate, as Grantor appoints by will.  Part I, Article FIRST(f) provides that, in \ndefault of this appointment, ten percent of any undistributed property will be distributed \nin trust for Friend, if Friend is then serving on the Power of Appointment Committee, and \nthe balance in equal shares in trust for Nephew and his issue, Niece 1 and her issue, \nand Niece 2 and her issue (Grantor\u2019s Testamentary Power).    \n \nYou have requested the following rulings: \n \n1.  As long as the Power of Appointment Committee is serving, no portion of the items \nof income, deductions, and credits against tax of the Trust shall be included in \ncomputing under \u00a7 671 the taxable income, deductions, and credits of Grantor or any \nmember of the Power of Appointment Committee. \n \n2.  The contribution of property to Trust by Grantor will not be a completed gift subject to \nfederal gift tax. \n \n3.  Any distribution of property by the Power of Appointment Committee from Trust to \nGrantor will not be a completed gift, subject to federal gift tax, by any member of the \nPower of Appointment Committee. \n \n4.  Any distribution of property by the Power of Appointment Committee from Trust to \nany beneficiary of Trust, other than to Grantor, will not be a completed gift subject to \nfederal gift tax, by any member of the Power of Appointment Committee. \n \n \nPLR-103339-19 \n \n5 \n5.  No member of the Power of Appointment Committee upon his or her death will \ninclude in his or her estate any property held in Trust because such member is deemed \nto have a general power of appointment within the meaning of \u00a7 2041 over property \nheld in Trust. \n \nRULING 1 \n \nSection 671 provides that where it is specified in subpart E of part I of subchapter J that \nthe grantor or another person shall be treated as the owner of any portion of a trust, \nthere shall then be included in computing the taxable income and credits of the grantor \nor the other person those items of income, deductions, and credits against tax of the \ntrust which are attributable to that portion of the trust to the extent that such items would \nbe taken into account under chapter 1 in computing taxable income or credits against \nthe tax of an individual. \n \nSection 672(a) provides, for purposes of subpart E, the term \u201cadverse party\u201d means any \nperson having a substantial beneficial interest in the trust which would be adversely \naffected by the exercise or nonexercise of the power which he possesses respecting the \ntrust. \n \nSections 673 through 677 specify the circumstances under which the grantor is treated \nas the owner of a portion of a trust. \n \nSection 673(a) provides that the grantor shall be treated as the owner of any portion of \na trust in which the grantor has a reversionary interest in either the corpus or the income \ntherefrom, if, as of the inception of that portion of the trust, the value of such interest \nexceeds five (5) percent of the value of such portion. \n \nSection 674(a) provides, in general, that the grantor shall be treated as the owner of any \nportion of a trust in respect of which the beneficial enjoyment of the corpus or the \nincome therefrom is subject to a power of disposition, exercisable by the grantor or a \nnonadverse party, or both, without the approval or consent of any adverse party. \n \nSection 674(b) provides that \u00a7 674(a) shall not apply to the powers described in \n\u00a7 674(b) regardless of whom held. \n \nSection 674(b)(3) provides that \u00a7 674(a) shall not apply to a power exercisable only by \nwill, other than a power in the grantor to appoint by will the income of the trust where the \nincome is accumulated for such disposition by the grantor or may be so accumulated in \nthe discretion of the grantor or a nonadverse party, or both, without the approval or \nconsent of any adverse party. \n \nSection 674(b)(5) provides that \u00a7 674(a) shall not apply to a power to distribute corpus \nto or for a beneficiary, provided that the power is limited by a reasonably definite \nstandard. \n \nPLR-103339-19 \n \n6 \n \nUnder \u00a7 675 and applicable regulations, the grantor is treated as the owner of any \nportion of a trust if, under the terms of the trust agreement or circumstances attendant \non its operation, administrative control is exercisable primarily for the benefit of the \ngrantor rather than the beneficiary of the trust. \n \nSection 676(a) provides that the grantor shall be treated as the owner of any portion of \na trust, whether or not he is treated as such owner under any other provision of part I, \nsubchapter J, chapter 1, where at any time the power to revest in the grantor title to \nsuch portion is exercisable by the grantor or a nonadverse party, or both. \n \nSection 677(a) provides, in general, that the grantor shall be treated as the owner of any \nportion of a trust, whether or not he is treated as such owner under \u00a7 674, whose \nincome without the approval or consent of any adverse party is, or, in the discretion of \nthe grantor or a nonadverse party, or both, may be (1) distributed to the grantor or the \ngrantor's spouse; (2) held or accumulated for future distribution to the grantor or the \ngrantor's spouse; or (3) applied to the payment of premiums on policies of insurance on \nthe life of the grantor or the grantor's spouse. \n \nSection 678(a) provides that a person other than the grantor shall be treated as the \nowner of any portion of a trust with respect to which: (1) such person has a power \nexercisable solely by himself to vest the corpus or the income therefrom in himself, or \n(2) such person has previously partially released or otherwise modified such a power \nand after the release or modification retains such control as would, within the principles \nof \u00a7\u00a7 671-677, inclusive, subject a grantor of a trust to treatment as the owner thereof.  \n \nSection 679(a) provides that a United States person who directly or indirectly transfers \nproperty to a foreign trust shall be treated as the owner for his taxable year of the \nportion of such trust attributable to such property if for such year there is a United States \nbeneficiary of any portion of the trust. \n \nBased solely on the facts and representations submitted and except as caveated below, \nwe conclude an examination of Trust reveals none of the circumstances that would \ncause Grantor to be treated as the owner of any portion of Trust under \u00a7\u00a7 673, 674, \n676, 677, or 679 as long as Trust is a domestic trust and the Power of Appointment \nCommittee remains in existence and serving.  Because none of the members of Power \nof Appointment Committee have a power exercisable by himself to vest trust income or \ncorpus in himself, none shall be treated as the owner of Trust under \u00a7 678(a). \n \n \nWe further conclude that an examination of Trust reveals none of the circumstances \nthat would cause administrative controls to be considered exercisable primarily for the \nbenefit of Grantor under \u00a7 675. Thus, the circumstances attendant on the operation of \nTrust will determine whether Grantor will be treated as the owner of any portion of Trust \nunder \u00a7 675.  This is a question of fact, the determination of which must be deferred \n \nPLR-103339-19 \n \n7 \nuntil the federal income tax returns of the parties involved have been examined by the \noffice with responsibility for such examination. \n \nLastly, no opinion is expressed or implied regarding the income tax consequences of \nany provision permitting the Trustee to distribute income or principal pursuant to the \nPower of Appointment Committee\u2019s exercise of the Adverse Party Power.  Further, no \nopinion is expressed or implied regarding the income tax consequences of any other \nprovision of Trust not referenced in this private letter ruling. \n \nRULINGS 2 AND 3 \n \nSection 2501(a)(1) provides for the imposition of a gift tax on the transfer of property by \ngift.  Section 2511(a) provides that the gift tax applies whether the transfer is in trust or \notherwise, whether the gift is direct or indirect, and whether the property is real or \npersonal, tangible or intangible. \n \nSection 25.2511-2(b) of the Gift Tax Regulations provides that a gift is complete as to \nany property with respect to which the donor has so parted with dominion and control as \nto leave the donor with no power to change the disposition of the property, whether for \nthe donor's own benefit, or for the benefit of another.  But if upon a transfer of property \n(whether in trust or otherwise) the donor reserves any power over its disposition, the gift \nmay be wholly incomplete, or may be partially complete and partially incomplete, \ndepending upon all the facts in the particular case.  Accordingly, in every case of a \ntransfer of property subject to a reserved power, the terms of the power must be \nexamined and its scope determined. \n \nSection 25.2511-2(b) provides an example, where the donor transfers property in trust \nto pay the income to the donor, or accumulate it in the discretion of the trustee, and the \ndonor retains a testamentary power to appoint the remainder among the donor's \ndescendants.  The regulation concludes that no portion of the transfer is a completed \ngift.  However, if the donor had not retained a testamentary power of appointment, but \nhad instead provided that the remainder should go to X or his heirs, the entire transfer \nwould be a completed gift. \n \nSection 25.2511-2(c) provides that a gift is incomplete in every instance in which a \ndonor reserves the power to revest the beneficial title in himself or herself.  A gift is also \nincomplete if and to the extent that a reserved power gives the donor the power to name \nnew beneficiaries or to change the interests of the beneficiaries as between themselves \nunless the power is a fiduciary power limited by a fixed or ascertainable standard. \nSection 25.2511-2(f) provides that the relinquishment or termination of a power to \nchange the beneficiaries of transferred property, occurring otherwise than by death of \nthe donor, is regarded as an event which completes the gift and causes the gift tax to \napply. \n \n \nPLR-103339-19 \n \n8 \nSection 25.2511-2(g) provides that if a donor transfers property to himself as trustee (or \nto himself and some other person, not possessing a substantial adverse interest, as \ntrustees), and retains no beneficial interest in the trust property and no power over it \nexcept fiduciary powers, the exercise or nonexercise of which is limited by a fixed or \nascertainable standard, to change the beneficiaries of the transferred property, the \ndonor has made a completed gift. \n \nUnder \u00a7 25.2511-2(e), a donor is considered as possessing a power if it is exercisable \nby the donor in conjunction with any person not having a substantial adverse interest in \nthe disposition of the transferred property.  Section 25.2511-2(f) provides that the \nrelinquishment or termination of a power to change the beneficiaries of transferred \nproperty, occurring otherwise than by death of the donor, is regarded as the event which \ncompletes the gift and causes the gift tax to apply. \n \nSection 25.2511-2(e) does not define \u201csubstantial adverse interest.\u201d   \n \nSection 25.2514-3(b)(2) provides, in part, that a taker in default of appointment under a \npower has an interest that is adverse to an exercise of the power.  Section 25.2514-\n3(b)(2) also provides that a co-holder of a power is considered as having an adverse \ninterest where he may possess the power after the possessor's death and may exercise \nit at that time in favor of himself, his estate, his creditors, or the creditors of his estate. \n \nIn Estate of Sanford v. Commissioner, 308 U.S. 39 (1939), the taxpayer created a trust \nfor the benefit of named beneficiaries and reserved the power to revoke the trust in \nwhole or in part, and to designate new beneficiaries other than himself.  Six years later, \nin 1919, the taxpayer relinquished the power to revoke the trust, but retained the right to \nchange the beneficiaries.  In 1924, the taxpayer relinquished the right to change the \nbeneficiaries.  The Court stated that the taxpayer's gift is not complete, for purposes of \nthe gift tax, when the donor has reserved the power to determine those others who \nwould ultimately receive the property.  Accordingly, the Court held that the taxpayer's \ngift was complete in 1924, when he relinquished his right to change the beneficiaries of \nthe trust.  A's retention of a power to change the beneficial interests in a trust causes \nthe transfer to the trust to be incomplete for gift tax purposes, even though the power \nmay be defeated by the actions of third parties.  Goldstein v. Commissioner, 37 T.C. \n897 (1962).  See also Estate of Goelet v. Commissioner, 51 T.C. 352 (1968). \n \nIn this case, Grantor retained the Grantor's Consent Power over the income and \nprincipal of Trust.  Under \u00a7 25.2511-2(e), a donor is considered as himself having a \npower if it is exercisable by him in conjunction with any person not having a substantial \nadverse interest in the disposition of the transferred property or the income therefrom. \nPower of Appointment Committee members are not takers in default for purposes of \n\u00a7 25.2514-3(b)(2).  They are merely co-holders of the power.  Under \u00a7 25.2514-3(b)(2), \na co-holder of a power is only considered as having an adverse interest where he may \npossess the power after the possessor's death and may exercise it at that time in favor \nof himself, his estate, his creditors, or the creditors of his estate.  In this case, the Power \n \nPLR-103339-19 \n \n9 \nof Appointment Committee ceases to exist upon Grantor's death.  Accordingly, the \nPower of Appointment Committee members do not have interests adverse to Grantor \nunder \u00a7 25.2514-3(b)(2) and for purposes of \u00a7 25.2511-2(e).  Therefore, Grantor is \nconsidered as possessing the power to distribute income and principal to any \nbeneficiary himself because he retained the Grantor's Consent Power.  \n \nGrantor also retained Grantor's First Sole Power over the principal of Trust (held while \nthe Power of Appointment Committee is in existence) and Grantor\u2019s Second Sole Power \nover the income and principal of Trust (held after the Power of Appointment Committee \ndissolves).  Under \u00a7 25.2511-2(c), a gift is incomplete if and to the extent that a \nreserved power gives the donor the power to name new beneficiaries or to change the \ninterests of the beneficiaries as between themselves unless the power is a fiduciary \npower limited by a fixed or ascertainable standard.  In this case, the Grantor's First and \nSecond Sole Powers give Grantor the power to change the interests of the \nbeneficiaries.  Grantor's First and Second Sole Powers are non-fiduciary powers.  Even \nthough Grantor will relinquish Grantor\u2019s First Sole Power, Grantor reserves Grantor\u2019s \nSecond Sole Power over a different class of appointees.  Accordingly, the retention of \nGrantor's First and Second Sole Powers causes the transfer of property to Trust to be \nwholly incomplete for federal gift tax purposes when Grantor contributes property to \nTrust.  The transfer will continue to be incomplete in the event that the Power of \nAppointment Committee dissolves prior to Grantor\u2019s death. \n \nFurther, Grantor retained Grantor's Testamentary Power to appoint the property in Trust \nto any persons, other than Grantor's estate, Grantor's creditors, or the creditors of \nGrantor's estate.  Under \u00a7 25.2514-3(b)(2), the retention of a testamentary power to \nappoint the remainder of a trust is considered a retention of dominion and control over \nthe remainder.  Accordingly, the retention of this power causes the transfer of property \nto Trust to be incomplete with respect to the remainder in Trust for federal tax purposes.   \n \nFinally, the Power of Appointment Committee members possess the Unanimous \nMember Power and the Adverse Party Power over income and principal.  These powers \nare not conditions precedent to Grantor's powers.  Grantor's powers over the income \nand principal are presently exercisable and not subject to a condition precedent.  \nGrantor retains dominion and control over the income and principal of Trust until the \nPower of Appointment Committee members exercise their Unanimous Member Power \nor Adverse Party Power.  Accordingly, the Unanimous Member Power and the Adverse \nParty Power do not cause the transfer of property to be complete with respect to the \nincome and principal interests in Trust for federal gift tax purposes.   \n \nIf the Power of Appointment Committee ceases to exist, the Trustee, in its fiduciary \ncapacity, also has the power to distribute net income or principal to one or more \nBeneficiaries.  The powers of the Trustee are not conditions precedent to the Grantor\u2019s \npowers.  Grantor\u2019s Consent Power over income and principal and Grantor\u2019s First Sole \nPower over principal are presently exercisable and not subject to a condition precedent.  \nAdditionally, Grantor\u2019s Second Sole Power over income and principal is exercisable \n \nPLR-103339-19 \n \n10 \nimmediately after the Power of Appointment Committee ceases to exist and is not \nsubject to a condition precedent.  Accordingly, Grantor retains dominion and control \nover the principal of Trust until the Trustee exercises its power to appoint income or \nprincipal.  Thus, the Trustee\u2019s power to distribute net income or principal does not cause \nthe transfer of property to Trust to be complete for federal gift tax purposes.  \nAccordingly, the retention of the Grantor\u2019s Consent Power, the Grantor\u2019s First Sole \nPower, and the Grantor\u2019s Second Sole Power causes the transfer of property to Trust to \nbe wholly incomplete for federal gift tax purposes.   \n \nAccordingly, based on the facts submitted and the representations made, we conclude \nthat the contribution of property to Trust by Grantor is not a completed gift subject to \nfederal gift tax.  Any distribution from Trust to Grantor is merely a return of Grantor's \nproperty.  Therefore, we conclude that any distribution of property by the Power of \nAppointment Committee from Trust to Grantor will not be a completed gift subject to \nfederal gift tax, by any member of the Power of Appointment Committee.  Further, upon \nGrantor's death, the fair market value of the property in Trust is includible in Grantor's \ngross estate for federal estate tax purposes. \n \nRULINGS 4 AND 5 \n \nSection 2514(b) provides that the exercise or release of a general power of appointment \ncreated after October 21, 1942, shall be deemed a transfer of property by the individual \npossessing such power. \n \nSection 2514(c) provides that the term \u201cgeneral power of appointment\u201d means a power \nwhich is exercisable in favor of the individual possessing the power (possessor), the \npossessor's estate, the possessor's creditors, or the creditors of the possessor's estate. \n \nSection 25.2514-1(c)(1) provides that a power of appointment is not a general power if \nby its terms it is exercisable only in favor of one or more designated persons or classes \nother than the possessor or his creditors, or the possessor's estate or the creditors of \nthe estate. \n \nSection 2514(c)(3)(A) provides that, in the case of a power of appointment created after \nOctober 21, 1942, if the power is exercisable by the possessor only in conjunction with \nthe creator of the power, such power is not deemed a general power of appointment. \n \nSection 2514(c)(3)(B) provides, that in the case of a power of appointment created after \nOctober 21, 1942, if the power is not exercisable by the possessor except in conjunction \nwith a person having a substantial interest in the property subject to the power, which is \nadverse to the exercise of the power in favor of the possessor, such power shall not be \ndeemed a general power of appointment.  For purposes of \u00a7 2514(c)(3)(B), a person \nwho, after the death of the possessor, may be possessed of a power of appointment \n(with respect to the property subject to the possessor's power) which he may exercise in \n \nPLR-103339-19 \n \n11 \nhis own favor shall be deemed as having an interest in the property and such interest \nshall be deemed adverse to such exercise of the possessor's power. \n \nSection 25.2514-3(b)(2) provides, in part, that a co-holder of a power has no adverse \ninterest merely because of his joint possession of the power nor merely because he is a \npermissible appointee under a power.  However, a co-holder of a power is considered \nas having an adverse interest where he may possess the power after the possessor's \ndeath and may exercise it at that time in favor of himself, his estate, his creditors, or the \ncreditors of his estate.  Thus, for example, if X, Y, and Z held a power jointly to appoint \namong a group of persons which includes themselves and if on the death of X the \npower will pass to Y and Z jointly, then Y and Z are considered to have interests \nadverse to the exercise of the power in favor of X. Similarly, if on Y's death the power \nwill pass to Z, Z is considered to have an interest adverse to the exercise of the power \nin favor of Y. \n \nSection 2041(a)(2) provides that the value of the gross estate shall include the value of \nall property to the extent of any property with respect to which the decedent has at the \ntime of death a general power of appointment created after October 21, 1942, or with \nrespect to which the decedent has at any time exercised or released such a power by a \ndisposition which is of such nature that if it were a transfer of property owned by the \ndecedent, such property would be includible in the decedent's gross estate under \n\u00a7\u00a7 2035 to 2038, inclusive. \n \nUnder \u00a7 2041(b)(1), the term \u201cgeneral power of appointment\u201d is defined, in relevant part, \nto mean a power which is exercisable in favor of the decedent, his estate, his creditors, \nor the creditors of his estate. \n \nSection 2041(b)(1)(C)(ii) provides, however, that in the case of a power of appointment \ncreated after October 21, 1942, if the power is not exercisable by the decedent except \nin conjunction with a person having a substantial interest in the property, subject to the \npower, which is adverse to the exercise of the power in favor of the decedent\u2014such \npower shall not be deemed a general power of appointment.  For purposes of \n\u00a7 2041(b)(1)(C)(ii), a person who, after the death of the decedent, may be possessed of \na power of appointment (with respect to the property subject to the decedent's power) \nwhich he may exercise in his own favor shall be deemed as having an interest in the \nproperty and such interest shall be deemed adverse to such exercise of the decedent's \npower. \n \nSection 20.2041-3(c)(2) of the Estate Tax Regulations provides, in part, that a co-holder \nof a power of appointment has no adverse interest merely because of his joint \npossession of the power nor merely because he is a permissible appointee under a \npower.  However, a co-holder of a power is considered as having an adverse interest \nwhere he may possess the power after the decedent's death and may exercise it at that \ntime in favor of himself, his estate, his creditors, or the creditors of his estate.  Thus, for \nexample, if X, Y, and Z held a power jointly to appoint among a group of persons which \n \nPLR-103339-19 \n \n12 \nincludes themselves and if on the death of X the power will pass to Y and Z jointly, then \nY and Z are considered to have interests adverse to the exercise of the power in favor \nof X.  Similarly, if on Y's death the power will pass to Z, Z is considered to have an \ninterest adverse to the exercise of the power in favor of Y. \n \nThe powers held by the Power of Appointment Committee members under the Grantor's \nConsent Power are powers that are exercisable only in conjunction with the creator, \nGrantor.  Accordingly, under \u00a7\u00a7 2514(b) and 2041(a)(2), the Power of Appointment \nCommittee members do not possess general powers of appointment by virtue of \npossessing this power.  The powers held by the Power of Appointment Committee \nmembers under the Unanimous Member Power are not general powers of appointment \nfor purposes of \u00a7\u00a7 2514(b) and 2041(a)(2).  As in the examples in \u00a7\u00a7 25.2514-3(b)(2) \nand 20.2041-3(c)(2), the Power of Appointment Committee members have substantial \nadverse interests in the property subject to this power.   \n \nThe powers held by the Power of Appointment Committee members under the Adverse \nParty Power are not general powers of appointment for purposes of \u00a7\u00a7 2514(b) and \n2041(a)(2).  Sections 2514(c) and 2041(b)(1) provide that the term general power of \nappointment means a power which is exercisable in favor of the individual possessing \nthe power (possessor), the possessor's estate, the possessor's creditors, or the \ncreditors of the possessor's estate.  Under the terms of the Adverse Party Power, the \npower is only exercisable by someone who is an adverse party with respect to the \ndistribution.  The possessor of a power cannot be an adverse party with respect to a \ndistribution to himself, his estate, his creditors or the creditors of his estate.  Therefore, \nthe Adverse Party Power can never be exercised in favor of the possessor, his estate, \nhis creditors or the creditors of estate, and, as a result, is not a general power of \nappointment.      \n \nAccordingly, any distributions made from Trust to a beneficiary pursuant to the exercise \nof these powers (the Grantor's Consent Power, the Unanimous Member Powers and the \nAdverse Party Power) are not gifts by the Power of Appointment Committee members. \n \nBased on the facts submitted and representations made, we conclude that any \ndistribution of property by the Power of Appointment Committee from Trust to any \nbeneficiary of Trust, other than Grantor, will not be a completed gift subject to federal \ngift tax, by any member of the Power of Appointment Committee.  Further, we conclude \nthat any distribution of property from Trust to a beneficiary other than Grantor will be a \ncompleted gift by Grantor.  Finally, we conclude that the powers held by the Power of \nAppointment Committee are not general powers of appointment for purposes of \n\u00a7 2041(a)(2) and, accordingly, no member of the Power of Appointment Committee \nupon his or her death will include in his or her estate any property held in Trust because \nsuch member is deemed to have a general power of appointment within the meaning of \n\u00a7 2041 over property held in Trust.   \n \n \nPLR-103339-19 \n \n13 \nExcept as specifically ruled herein, we express no opinion on the federal tax \nconsequences of the transaction under the cited provisions or under any other \nprovisions of the Code. Specifically, we express no opinion on the trust provisions \npermitting Trustee to distribute income or principal to trustees of other qualified trusts \n(decanting). \n \n \nSincerely, \n \n \nFaith P.

Hospital is \ndescribed in section 501(c)(3) of the Code and is classified as an organization described in \nsections 509(a)(1) and 170(b)(1)(A)(iii).  Hospital is a part of a large healthcare system \n(\u201cSystem\u201d) governed by Parent.    \n \nParent is a nonprofit corporation that was formed under the laws of the State of L.  Parent is \ndescribed in section 501(c)(3) of the Code and classified as an organization described in section \n509(a)(3).  Parent controls a large healthcare system consisting of both tax-exempt and taxable \norganizations.  Hospital and Parent share a common governing board and common key \nemployees including Hospital\u2019s president, vice-presidents, secretary, and treasurer.    \n \nA number of professional medical corporations (\u201cPCs\u201d) that engage in the private practice of \nmedicine are affiliated with the Parent.  Each PC was formed as a professional corporation \nunder the laws of the State of L.  All of the PCs file tax returns either on Form 1120 or Form \n1120-S.   \n \nThe acquisition, formation and operation of the PCs were substantially funded through formal \n \n- 2 - \n \n \n \n \n \nand informal loans and advances from Parent and Hospital.  A small portion of the debt \noutstanding represented funds that Parent borrowed from an outside lender at a certain interest \nrate and re-loaned to the PCs at the same rate through written loan agreements.  Most of the \nloans and advances from Parent and Hospital were made without written loan agreements or \nnotes.  Repayments of principal and interest amounts by the PCs have been infrequent.  Parent \nand Hospital accrued the unpaid interest and added it to the balance of the outstanding debt.   \nAs of Date x and Date y, a substantial amount of this debt was outstanding.   \n \nThis ruling request involves six of these PCs.  The six PCs practice medicine in the following \nareas:  comprehensive health services, surgical and musculoskeletal services, cardiovascular \nand thoracic surgery, radiology, family medicine, and pediatrics.  No patients of the six PCs are \nalso patients of Hospital.   \n  \nThe law of the State of L requires that a licensed physician hold the stock of a professional \ncorporation engaged in the practice of medicine.  Pursuant to the agreements discussed below, \nan employee-physician of Hospital is the sole shareholder of each PC. (Hereafter, each such \nemployee-physician-shareholder is referred to as \u201cPhysician.\u201d)   \n \nHospital, the PCs and the Physicians have entered into employment agreements, shareholder \nagreements, and affiliation agreements.  (Hereafter, these agreements are referred to \ncollectively as \u201cAgreements.\u201d)  Hospital has represented that there are no material differences \nbetween each of these employment agreements, shareholder agreements and affiliation \nagreements.  In the case of PCs that filed tax returns on Form 1120-S, none of the Physicians \nreported their share of the applicable corporation\u2019s income and losses on their individual income \ntax returns.   \n \nIn the employment agreement, Physician is employed by Hospital as the chairman of one of \nHospital\u2019s departments.  In the related affiliation agreement, Hospital provides management, \nprofessional, and administrative services to the PC.  The shareholder agreement provides for \nPhysician to purchase PC stock for a nominal amount; requires Physician to be employed by \nHospital through the PC, and prohibits Physician from selling, assigning, transferring, \nhypothecating or otherwise disposing of or encumbering the stock.  The shareholder agreement \nprohibits any involuntary transfer of the stock and requires Physician to take necessary action to \nremain the sole shareholder and director of the PC.  In the event Physician\u2019s employment with \nthe PC terminates, the shareholder agreement requires that Physician sell all shares to an \nindividual selected by Hospital for the same nominal value that Physician paid.  The shareholder \nagreement states the stock certificates issued to Physician bear a legend referring to the \nrestrictions on the transfer of the stock pursuant to the shareholder agreement.  The \nemployment agreement provides that Physician is not entitled to the profits or losses from the \noperation of the PC and requires Physician to give to Hospital any income received from the \nPC.  \n \nThe PCs each entered into affiliation agreements with Hospital under which Hospital provides \nmanagement, professional, and administrative services to each PC.  The agreement provides \nthat each party has the ability to unilaterally terminate the agreement.  However, under some of \n \n- 3 - \n \n \n \n \n \nthe employment agreements and bylaws of the PCs, a Physician is prevented from exercising \nthis right.  \n \nRulings Requested \n \n1. \nFor taxable years ending Date x and Date y, was Hospital or Parent a \u201ccontrolling \norganization\u201d with respect to the PCs, within the meaning of section 512(b)(13)(A) of the \nCode?  \n \n2. \nIf the answer to Ruling Request No. 1 is Yes, did the PCs have \u201cnet unrelated income\u201d or \n\u201cnet unrelated loss\u201d under section 512(b)(13)(B) of the Code?  \n \n3. \nIf the answers to Ruling Requests No. 1 and 2 are Yes, is the interest received or \naccrued by Hospital and Parent from the PCs treated as gross income derived from an \nunrelated trade or business under section 512(b)(13)(A) of the Code? \n \nLaw \n \nSection 511(a)(1) of the Code imposes a tax on the unrelated business taxable income of \norganizations described in section 501(c).   \n \nUnder section 512(a)(1) of the Code, the term \u201cunrelated business taxable income\u201d means the \ngross income derived by any organization from any \u201cunrelated trade or business regularly \ncarried on,\u201d less the applicable deductions and modifications.   \n \n \nUnder section 513(a) of the Code, the term \u201cunrelated trade or business\u201d means \u201c. . . any trade \nor business the conduct of which is not substantially related . . . to the exercise or performance \nby such organization of its charitable, educational, or other purpose or function constituting the \nbasis for its exemption under section 501. . . \u201c  \n \nUnder section 1.513-1(a) of the Income Tax Regulations, an exempt organization\u2019s gross \nincome is treated as \u201cunrelated business taxable income\u201d if: \n \n(1) \nIt is income from a trade or business;  \n \n(2) \nSuch trade or business is regularly carried on by the organization; and \n \n(3) \nThe conduct of the trade or business is not substantially related to the \norganization\u2019s performance of its exempt functions.   \n \nUnder section 1.513-1(d)(2) of the regulations, a \u201ctrade or business\u201d is \u201crelated\u201d to exempt \npurposes \u201conly where the conduct of the business has causal relationship to the achievement of \nexempt purposes.\u201d  A \u201ctrade or business\u201d is \u201csubstantially related\u201d \u201conly if the causal relationship \nis a substantial one.\u201d  That is, \u201cthe production or distribution of the goods or the performance of \nthe services from which the gross income is derived must contribute importantly to the \n \n- 4 - \n \n \n \n \n \naccomplishment of those [tax-exempt] purposes.\u201d  Whether activities productive of gross income \ncontribute importantly to the accomplishment of a tax-exempt purpose \u201cdepends in each case \nupon the facts and circumstances involved.\u201d \n \nSection 1.513-1(d)(3) of the regulations provides that the size and extent of the activities must \nbe considered in relation to the nature and extent of the exempt function which they purport to \nserve.  If the organization realizes income from activities which are conducted on a larger scale \nthan is reasonably necessary for the performance of its exempt functions, the gross income \nattributable to that portion of the activities in excess of the needs of exempt functions constitutes \ngross income from the conduct of unrelated trade or business.  See Geisinger Health Plan v. \nCommissioner, 100 T.C. 394, 405 (1993) (determination of whether conduct is substantially \nrelated \u201cconsiders the degree to which income is earned from services rendered or sales made \nto persons who are not patients of the exempt affiliated entity.\u201d), aff\u2019d 30 F.3d 494 (3rd Cir. \n1994); Redlands Surgical Services v. Commissioner, 113 T.C. 47, 95-96 (1999) (conduct was \nnot substantially related to affiliated organization when the patient populations did not overlap \nsubstantially), aff\u2019d per curiam 242 F.3d 904 (9th Cir. 2001); IHC Health Plans v. Commissioner, \nT.C. Memo 2001-246 (by contracting for services from independent physicians, operations were \nconducted on scale larger than reasonably necessary to accomplish affiliate hospital\u2019s exempt \npurposes), aff\u2019d 325 F.3d 1188 (10th Cir. 2003). \n \nSections 512(b)(1), (2), and (3) of the Code exclude from the computation of unrelated business \ntaxable income interest, dividends, royalties, and rents from real property, and rents from \npersonal property leased with such real property, if the rents attributable to such personal \nproperty are only an incidental amount of the total rents received under the lease. \n \nSection 512(b)(13) of the Code provides special rules for certain amounts of income an exempt \norganization receives from a controlled entity.  \n \nSection 512(b)(13)(A) of the Code provides that notwithstanding sections 512(b)(1), (2) and (3), \na \u201cspecified payment\u201d that an exempt organization receives or accrues from a \u201ccontrolled \norganization\u201d is treated by the controlling organization as unrelated business taxable income to \nthe extent such payment reduces the \u201cnet unrelated income\u201d of the controlled entity (or \nincreases its net unrelated loss).  All deductions of the controlling organization directly \nconnected with amounts treated as derived from an unrelated trade or business are allowed.  \n \nSection 512(b)(13)(B)(i)(I) of the Code states that the term \u201cnet unrelated income\u201d means, in the \ncase of a controlled entity not exempt under section 501(c)(3), the portion of the entity\u2019s taxable \nincome which would be unrelated business taxable income if such entity were exempt and had \nthe same exempt purpose as the controlling organization. \n \nSection 512(b)(13)(C) of the Code states that the term \u201cspecified payment\u201d means any interest, \nannuity, royalty, or rent. \n \n \n- 5 - \n \n \n \n \n \nSection 512(b)(13)(D)(i) of the Code provides, in part, that the term \u201ccontrol\u201d means in the case \nof a corporation, ownership (by vote or value) of more than 50 percent of the stock of such \ncorporation.   \n \nSection 512(b)(13)(D)(ii) of the Code provides that section 318 (relating to constructive \nownership of stock) shall apply for purposes of determining ownership of stock in a corporation, \nand similar principles shall apply for purposes of determining ownership of interests in any other \nentity.  \n \nThe Pension Protection Act of 2006, Pub.L. 109-280, Title XII, section 1205(a) (Aug. 17, 2006), \nadded new section 512(b)(13)(E) to the Code.  Section 512(b)(13)(E) generally provides that \nsection 512(b)(13)(A) applies only to that portion of a specified payment that the controlling \norganization receives or accrues that exceeds the amount that would meet the requirements of \nsection 482.  Section 512(b)(13)(E) only applies to payments made pursuant to a written binding \ncontract in effect on August 17, 2006 that are received or accrued after December 31, 2005 and \non or before December 31, 2007. \n \nFrank Lyon Co. v. U.S., 435 U.S. 561, 572 (1978) held that ownership for federal income tax \npurposes is determined by beneficial interest.  See Rev. Rul. 2003-91, 2003-2 C.B. 82 (federal \ntaxation based on having \u201csufficient incidents of ownership,\u201d not mere legal title). \n  \nHimmel v. Commissioner, 338 F. 2d 815 (2d Cir. 1964), states that stock ownership involves \nthree important rights: (1) the right to vote and thereby exercise control; (2) the right to \nparticipate in current earnings and accumulated surplus; and (3) the right to share in net assets \non liquidation.  See Rev. Rul. 81-289, 1981-2 C.B. 82; Rev. Rul. 85-106, 1985-2 C.B. 116.   \n \nIn Nebraska Dep\u2019t of Revenue v. Lowenstein, 513 U.S. 123 (1994), the Court recharacterized \nthe taxpayer\u2019s form so as to accord with economic reality.   \n \nAnalysis \n \nRuling Request No. 1 \n.   \nWhile a Physician holds legal title to the shares of stock of each of the PCs, each of the \nPhysicians merely are acting as Hospital\u2019s nominees pursuant to the Agreements and are not \nbeneficial owners.  Frank Lyon Co. v. U.S., supra.  Instead, Hospital holds all the significant \nrights granted by stock ownership.  Himmel v. Commissioner, supra; Rev. Rul. 85-106, supra; \nRev. Rul. 81-289, supra.  Pursuant to the shareholder agreements, at any time, Hospital can \nreplace the present Physician and cause the Physician to sell the stock of the PC to another \nPhysician of its choosing at the same nominal price that the first Physician paid for the stock.  \nThe various Agreements provide that each Physician holds the stock of the PC at Hospital\u2019s \npleasure and Physician cannot act with regard to the stock contrary to Hospital\u2019s instructions. \n \nParent and Hospital apparently agree that the Agreements would normally be treated as giving \nHospital beneficial ownership of the equity interest in each of the PCs.  However, Parent and \n \n- 6 - \n \n \n \n \n \nHospital contend that under the law of the State of L, non-physician ownership of medical PCs \nis prohibited, and as a result, the Agreements are unenforceable.  They contend that L law \nspecifically prohibits a physician from holding the stock of a medical PC as a nominee or proxy \nfor a non-physician. \n \nEven if the Agreements between Hospital, the PCs and the Physicians are not legally \nenforceable under L law, it is still appropriate to treat the Agreements as valid because: (i) the \nparties have acted in accord with the Agreements; (ii) the parties intend to continue to honor the \nAgreements; (iii) Hospital and other Physicians have honored similar Agreements in the past; \nand (iv) there is no economic incentive for a Physician not to honor the Agreement.  Treating the \nAgreements as valid accords with business reality and is the result the parties intended.  \nNebraska Dep\u2019t of Revenue v. Lowenstein, supra.   \n \nTherefore, because Hospital beneficially owns by vote more than 50 percent of the stock of the \nPCs, Hospital is a controlling organization of the PCs within the meaning of section \n512(b)(13)(A) of the Code.   \n \nRuling Request No. 2 \n \nThe PCs\u2019 provision of medical services to their own patients does not have a substantial causal \nrelationship to the achievement of Hospital\u2019s exempt purposes.  Geisinger Health Plan, supra; \nRedlands Surgical Services, supra; IHC Health Plans, supra.   Thereby, the PCs are conducting \ntheir activities on a larger scale than is reasonably necessary for the performance of Hospital\u2019s \nexempt functions.   Section 1.513-1(d)(3) of the regulations; IHC Health Plans, supra.  \nConsequently, the PCs are engaged in an unrelated trade or business with respect to Hospital.  \nTherefore, the PCs\u2019 income (or loss) from providing medical services to its patients, less \napplicable deductions, is \u201cnet unrelated income\u201d (or \u201cnet unrelated loss\u201d) within the meaning of \nsection 512(b)(13)(B) of the Code.      \n \nRuling Request No. 3 \n \nHospital and Parent received and accrued interest from the PCs pursuant to the loans and \nadvances they made to the PCs to acquire, form and operate such PCs.  Because interest \nconstitutes a \u201cspecified payment\u201d within the meaning of section 512(b)(13)(C) of the Code, the \nreceipt or accrual of such interest by Hospital and Parent is gross income derived from an \nunrelated trade or business under section 512(b)(13)(A) , to the extent it reduces the PCs\u2019 net \nunrelated income (or increases its net unrelated loss).       \n \nYou did not request a ruling on the applicability of new section 512(b)(13)(E) of Code, nor did \nyou submit facts to support such a ruling.  Further, we are declining to rule on the applicability of \nthis section pursuant to Rev. Proc. 2006-4, section  8.01 because of the factual nature of the \nvalue of the loans and advances.      \n \nRulings \n \n \n- 7 - \n \n \n \n \n \n1. \nFor taxable years ending Date x and Date y, Hospital was a \u201ccontrolling organization\u201d \nwith respect to the PCs within the meaning of section 512(b)(13)(A) of the Code.  \n \n2. \nThe PCs\u2019 income (or loss) from providing medical services to its patients, less applicable \ndeductions, is \u201cnet unrelated income\u201d (or \u201cnet unrelated loss\u201d) under section \n512(b)(13)(B) of the Code. \n \n3. \nInterest received or accrued by Hospital and Parent from the PCs is gross income \nderived from an unrelated trade or business under section 512(b)(13)(A) of the Code. \n \nThe rulings contained in this letter are based upon information and representations you \nsubmitted accompanied by a penalty of perjury statement executed by an appropriate official.  \nWhile we have not verified any of the material you submitted in support of the request for \nrulings, it is subject to verification on examination.

Except for the identities of the\ngrantor and the trustee and the term of the annuity, the provisions of the Trusts will be\nidentical.  The grantor of each of the Trusts will also be the initial sole trustee of that\ntrust.  A is the grantor of Trust 1, which provides an annuity for the shorter of a term of\nnine years or A\u2019s life.  B is the grantor of Trust 2, which provides an annuity for the\nshorter of a term of seven years or B\u2019s life.  Each grantor will fund that grantor\u2019s trust\nwith nonvoting stock of X, which is represented as being an S corporation.\nArticle II of the Trusts provides that the trust is irrevocable in all circumstances,\nunless the trustee determines that the grantor\u2019s interest in the trust does not qualify as\na qualified annuity interest under \u00a7 2702.  In such circumstances, the trustee may\namend the terms of the trust solely for the purpose of qualifying the trust, under court\ndecree.\nArticle III, Paragraph A provides for an annual annuity in the amount of 10.29%\nof the initial fair market value of the assets transferred to the trust, payable to the\ngrantor in quarterly installments on the last day of each quarter following the Effective\nDate, until the earlier of grantor\u2019s death or the fixed term of years of the trust.  The\nannuity amount shall be increased each year so that the Annuity Amount payable to the\ngrantor in that year equals 109.5% of the Annuity Amount paid to the grantor in the\n2\nPLR-119229-01\n-2-\npreceding year.  The annuity amount shall be paid from income and, to the extent\nincome is insufficient, from principal.\nArticle III, Paragraph B, provides that (1) in addition to the payment of the\nAnnuity Amount to the grantor, with respect to any year for which the grantor is\nconsidered the owner of the trust for state or federal income tax purposes, if the total\nincome taxes owed by the grantor on the net ordinary income and capital gains taxed to\nthe grantor as a result of the trust being a grantor trust exceeds the Annuity Amount\npaid to the grantor with respect to such year, the trustee shall distribute to the grantor\nan amount equal to such excess, and (2) any payment made under Article III,\nParagraph B, shall be made first from undistributed trust income and, to the extent such\nincome is insufficient, trust principal. \nArticle III, Paragraph C, provides that no additional contributions may be made to\nthe Trusts.\nArticle III, Paragraph D, provides that the interests of the grantors in the Trusts\nshall not be subject to commutation.\nArticle III, Paragraph E, provides that during the grantors\u2019 interests in the Trusts,\nno payment shall be made to any person other than the grantors.\nArticle III, Paragraph F, provides that any trust income not distributed as part of\nthe Annuity Amount or under the provisions of Article III, Paragraph B, shall be\naccumulated and added annually to principal. \nArticle III, Paragraph G.1.a. provides that if the grantor survives the annuity term,\nthe remaining trust assets shall be distributed equally among grantor\u2019s living children, if\nall of such children are living or if grantor\u2019s deceased children have no living issue.\nArticle III, Paragraph G.1.b. provides that if the grantor survives the annuity term,\nbut one or more of grantor\u2019s children is deceased and has living issue, then the\nremaining trust assets shall be divided equally among grantor\u2019s living children and\ndeceased children with issue.  The shares created for the living children will be\ndistributed to them outright.\nThe shares created for the deceased children with living issue will be\nadministered as follows:  The remaining trust assets will be divided into two separate\ntrusts: the Exempt Trust and the Non-Exempt Trust.  To the extent that the remaining\nassets are within grantor\u2019s available generation-skipping transfer exemption, at the time\nthat the annuity term terminates, it will be held in the Exempt Trust.  The balance of the\ntrust assets, if any, will be held in the Non-Exempt Trust.  The Exempt Trust then will be\ndivided into equal separate shares for the living issue of deceased children by right of\nrepresentation.\n3\nPLR-119229-01\n-3-\nThe Non-Exempt trust will be divided into equal separate shares for the\ndeceased children with living issue.  Each deceased child will have a testamentary\ngeneral power of appointment to designate who is to receive the assets in such Non-\nExempt trust.  The general power of appointment is exercisable in favor of anyone,\nincluding the deceased child, deceased child\u2019s estate, deceased child\u2019s creditors, and\ncreditors of the deceased child\u2019s estate.  This power of appointment shall be exercised\neither by specific reference to the Non-Exempt Trust in deceased child\u2019s will or by a\nduly acknowledged instrument delivered to the trustee that was effective at deceased\nchild\u2019s death.  If the power of appointment lapses, then the Non-Exempt Trust will be\ndivided into equal separate shares for the living issue of the deceased children by right\nof representation.\nThe Exempt Trusts and the Non-Exempt Trusts shall be held in trust for the\nbenefit of the issue of deceased children for the life of each one of such issue.  Each\nbeneficiary shall receive distributions of net income payable at least quarterly.  There\nshall be at all times only one income beneficiary of each separate trust.  The trustee\nmay invade the principal to provide for the beneficiary\u2019s health, education,\nmaintenance, and support.  No principal distributions may be made from any separate\ntrust to anyone other than the current income beneficiary of such trust.  Upon reaching\nthe age of 21, each beneficiary has the right to all or any portion of the remaining\nassets of the trust.  Upon a beneficiary\u2019s death, the trust shall terminate and the\nremaining assets of the trust shall be distributed to the beneficiary\u2019s estate.  However, if\nthe beneficiary shall die before the age of 21, the trust shall be distributed to specified\nfamily members of the beneficiary.  Each of the separate trusts is intended to qualify as\na qualified subchapter S trust (QSST) if the beneficiary makes the required election for\nthat trust to be a QSST.   \nArticle III, Paragraph G.2. provides that if the grantor does not survive the\nannuity term, the remaining trust assets will be subject to the grantor\u2019s general power of\nappointment as provided in grantor\u2019s last will and testament.  If the trustee is not\nnotified of the exercise of the general power of appointment within six months of the\ngrantor\u2019s death, the trustee shall distribute the remaining assets to the grantor\u2019s\nrevocable grantor trust, or if the revocable grantor trust is not in existence, to grantor\u2019s\nestate.\nRULINGS 1, 2, AND 3\nSection 671 provides that where it is specified in subpart E of Part I of\nsubchapter J that the grantor or another person shall be treated as the owner of any\nportion of a trust, there shall then be included in computing the taxable income and\ncredits of the grantor or the other person those items of income, deductions, and credits\nagainst tax of the trust which are attributable to that portion of the trust to the extent that\nsuch items would be taken into account under chapter 1 in computing taxable income\nor credits against the tax of an individual.\n4\nPLR-119229-01\n-4-\nSection 674(a) provides that the grantor shall be treated as the owner of any\nportion of a trust in respect of which the beneficial enjoyment of the corpus or the\nincome therefrom is subject to a power of disposition, exercisable by the grantor or a\nnonadverse party, or both, without the approval or consent of any adverse party.\nSection 674(b)(3) provides that \u00a7 674(a) shall not apply to a power, regardless of\nby whom held, exercisable only by will, other than a power in the grantor to appoint by\nwill the income of the trust where the income is accumulated for such disposition by the\ngrantor or may be so accumulated in the discretion of the grantor or a nonadverse\nparty, or both, without the approval or consent of any adverse party.\nSection 1.674(b)-1(b)(3) of the Income Tax Regulations provides that if a trust\ninstrument provides that the income is to be accumulated during the grantor\u2019s life and\nthat the grantor may appoint the accumulated income by will, the grantor is treated as\nthe owner of the trust.  Moreover, if a trust instrument provides that the income is\npayable to another person for life, but the grantor has a testamentary power of\nappointment over the remainder, and under the trust instrument and local law capital\ngains are added to corpus, the grantor is treated as the owner of a portion of the trust\nand capital gains and losses are included in that portion.\nSection 677(a)(1) provides, in general, that the grantor shall be treated as the\nowner of any portion of a trust, whether or not he is treated as such owner under \u00a7 674,\nwhose income without the approval or consent of any adverse party is, or, in the\ndiscretion of the grantor or a nonadverse party, or both, may be distributed to the\ngrantor or the grantor\u2019s spouse.\nSection 1361(c)(2)(A)(i) provides that a trust all of which is treated (under\nsubpart E of part I of subchapter J of chapter 1) as owned by an individual who is a\ncitizen or resident of the United States may be a shareholder of an S corporation.\nRev. Rul. 85-13, 1985-1 C.B. 184, provides that an exchange of assets between\na wholly-owned grantor trust and the deemed owner of the trust is not recognized as a\nsale for federal income tax purposes.\nUnder the terms of the Trusts, the annuities paid to A and B are to be paid from\nincome of their respective trusts and, to the extent income is insufficient, from principal. \nIncome not distributed is to be accumulated and added to principal.  A and B have the\ntestamentary power to appoint the corpus of their respective Trusts.  Accordingly, A and\nB are the owners of the portions of their respective Trusts which consist of the income\ndistributed to A and B under \u00a7 677(a)(1).  In addition, because A and B have the\ntestamentary power to appoint the corpus of their respective Trusts, including any trust\nincome not distributed to A or B and capital gains which have been accumulated and\nadded to the corpus, they are treated as the owners of the entire corpus under \n\u00a7\u00a7 674(a) and (b)(3).  Accordingly, A and B must include in computing their tax liability\nall items of income, deduction, and credit against the tax of their respective trusts.  The\nTrusts will be qualified S corporation shareholders during the period in which they are\n5\nPLR-119229-01\n-5-\ntreated as wholly-owned grantor trusts.  We further rule that no gain or loss will be\nrecognized by a grantor or the Trusts on the transfer of X stock to the trusts or on the\ntransfer of property from the Trusts to the respective grantors in payment of the annuity\namount or the income tax obligations described in Article III, Paragraph B.\nRULING 4\nSection 2601 imposes a tax on every generation-skipping transfer (GST). \n \nUnder \u00a7 2631(a), with regard to the GST tax, every individual is allowed a GST\nexemption that may be allocated by such individual to any property with respect to\nwhich such individual is the transferor.  Section 2631(b) provides that any allocation\nunder \u00a7 2631(a), once made, shall be irrevocable.  In general, under \u00a7 2632(a) any\nallocation by an individual of his GST exemption may be made at any time on or before\nthe date prescribed for filing the estate tax return for such individual's estate. \nSection 2642(f)(1) provides special rules for certain inter vivos transfers.  For\npurposes of determining the inclusion ratio, if (A) an individual makes an inter vivos\ntransfer of property, and (B) the value of the property would be includible in the gross\nestate of the individual under chapter 11 if the individual died immediately after making\nthe transfer (other than by reason of \u00a7 2035), any allocation of GST exemption to the\nproperty shall not be made before the close of the \"estate tax inclusion period.\u201d\n \nUnder \u00a7 2642(f)(3), the term \"estate tax inclusion period\" means any period after\nthe transfer described in \u00a7 2642(f)(1) during which the value of the property involved in\nthe transfer would be includible in the gross estate of the transferor under chapter 11 if\nhe died.  Such period shall in no event extend beyond the earlier of the date on which\nthere is a GST with respect to such property, or the date of the death of the transferor.\nIf grantor died immediately after funding the initial trust, the trust would be\nincluded in the grantor\u2019s gross estate under \u00a7 2036.  Therefore, \u00a7 2642(f)(1) applies to\nprevent any allocation of GST exemption to the property before the close of the estate\ntax inclusion period which, in this case, is the earlier of the end of the trust term or the\ndeath of the grantor.  Based upon the information submitted and the representations\nmade, we conclude that if A or B is living at the time the fixed term interest in their\nrespective trusts expire, then, commencing at that time A or B may allocate part or all of\ntheir respective remaining GST exemptions exclusively to the Exempt Trusts based on\nthe fair market value of the assets allocated to the Exempt Trusts as of the date the\nExempt Trusts are funded, so that the Exempt Trusts (and any separate trust created\nthereunder for the benefit of a grandchild of the A or B) has a zero inclusion ratio for\nGST purposes.\nRULING 5\nSection 2041(a)(2) provides, in part, that the value of the gross estate shall\ninclude the value of all property to the extent of any property with respect to which the\n6\nPLR-119229-01\n-6-\ndecedent has at the time of death a general power of appointment created after\nOctober 21, 1942. \nSection 2041(b)(1) defines the term \"general power of appointment\" as a power\nthat is exercisable in favor of the decedent, the decedent\u2019s estate, the decedent\u2019s\ncreditors, or the creditors of the decedent\u2019s estate.\nSection 20.2041-3(a)(2) of the Estate Tax Regulations provides that if the power\nis a general power of appointment, the value of an interest in property subject to the\npower is includible in the decedent's gross estate under \u00a7 2041(a)(2) if either (i) the\ndecedent has the power at the time of his death (and the interest exists at the time of\nhis death), or (ii) the decedent exercised or released the power, or the power lapsed.\nSection 2652(a)(1)(A) provides, in part, that the transferor for GST purposes is\nthe individual with respect to whom property was most recently subject to federal estate\ntax.\nSection 26.2652-1(a)(1) of the Generation-Skipping Transfer Tax Regulations\nprovides, in part, that an individual is treated as transferring any property with respect to\nwhich the individual is the transferor.\nSection 26.2652-1(a)(2) provides, in part, that a transfer is subject to federal\nestate tax if the value of the property is includible in the decedent\u2019s gross estate.\nThe deceased child of A and B will have a testamentary general power of\nappointment over the assets in the Non-Exempt Trust at the time of that child\u2019s death,\nbecause the child may appoint the assets to anyone including the child, child\u2019s estate,\nchild\u2019s creditors, or the creditors of the child\u2019s estate.  Accordingly, the value of the\nNon-Exempt Trust will be included in the gross estate of that deceased child regardless\nof whether the deceased child actually exercises or releases the general power of\nappointment or lets the power lapse.  The deceased child will be treated as the\ntransferor for purposes of \u00a7 2652(a)(1)(A).  Therefore, based on the facts submitted\nand the representations made, we conclude that distributions from the Non-Exempt\nTrust to a grandchild of A and B whose parent is a deceased child of A and B will not be\nsubject to the GST tax.\nRULING 6\nSection 1361(d)(3) provides that the term \u201cqualified subchapter S trust\u201d (QSST)\nmeans a trust (A) the terms of which require that (i) during the life of the current income\nbeneficiary, there shall only be 1 income beneficiary of the trust, (ii) any corpus\ndistributed during the life of the current income beneficiary may be distributed only to\nsuch beneficiary, (iii) the income interest of the current beneficiary in the trust shall\nterminate on the earlier of such beneficiary\u2019s death or the termination of the trust, and\n(iv) upon the termination of the trust during the life of the current income beneficiary, the\ntrust shall distribute all of its assets to such beneficiary, and (B) all of the income (within\n7\nPLR-119229-01\n-7-\nthe meaning of \u00a7 643(b)) of which is distributed (or required to be distributed) currently\nto 1 individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States.\nBased on the facts and representations submitted, we conclude that the\nseparate trusts created for the issue of a deceased child of the grantors of the Trusts\nunder Article III, Paragraph G.1.b. meet the requirements to qualify as QSSTs within the\nmeaning of \u00a7 1361(d)(3), and will be treated as QSSTs provided that the current\nincome beneficiary of each trust is a United States citizen and the beneficiary or the\nbeneficiary\u2019s legal representative timely makes the required election under \n\u00a7 1361(d)(2). \n \nExcept as specifically set forth above, no opinion is expressed or implied as to\nthe federal income tax consequences of the transactions described above under any\nother provision of the Code.\nThis ruling is directed only to the taxpayer on whose behalf it was requested. \nSection 6110(k)(3) provides that it may not be used or cited as precedent.  Pursuant to\na power of attorney on file with this office, a copy of this letter is being sent to the\nauthorized representative of the Trusts.\nSincerely yours,\nJ.

Fund 1 will also qualify and elect to be treated as a RIC,\nwhich computes its tax as provided by \u00a7 852.\nInterests in Fund 2 and Fund 3 are available only to segregated asset accounts\nthat fund Variable Contracts and to trustees of qualified pension and retirement plans. \nNo shares of Fund 2 or Fund 3  have ever been publicly available. \nThe Funds represent that all beneficial interests in Fund 1 will be held only by\nsegregated asset accounts that fund Variable Contracts (except as otherwise permitted\nunder \u00a7 1.817-5(f)(3) of the regulations).  Additionally, the Funds represent that public\naccess to Fund 1 will be available (directly or indirectly) exclusively (except as otherwise\npermitted under \u00a7 1.817-5(f)(3)) through the purchase of a Variable Contract.\nFund 1 proposes to invest a portion, or all, of its assets in Fund 2 and Fund 3. \nThe Funds represent that, after the proposed transaction, all beneficial interests in Fund\n2 and Fund 3 (except as otherwise permitted under \u00a7 1.817-5(f)(3) of the regulations)\nwill be held only by segregated asset accounts that fund Variable Contracts and that\n(except as otherwise permitted under \u00a7 1.817-5(f)(3)) public access to each of the\nFunds will remain available (directly or indirectly) exclusively through the purchase of a\nVariable Contract.  \nFund 1 is also considering investing in RICs other than Fund 2 and Fund 3.  All\nbeneficial interests in such other RICs (except as otherwise permitted under \u00a7 1.817-\n5(f)(3) of the regulations) will be held by segregated asset accounts that fund Variable\nContracts and public access to such other RICs will be available (directly or indirectly)\nexclusively (except as otherwise permitted under \u00a7 1.817-5(f)(3)) through the purchase\nof a Variable Contract.\nSTATUTORY AND  REGULATORY PROVISIONS \nSection 817(h)(1) of the Code provides that, for purposes of subchapter L, \u00a7 72\n(relating to annuities), and \u00a7 7702(a) (relating to the definition of life insurance contract),\na variable contract (other than a pension plan contract), which is otherwise described in\n\u00a7 817 and which is based on a segregated asset account, shall not be treated as an\nannuity, endowment, or life insurance contract for any period (and any subsequent\nperiod) for which the investments made by such account are not, in accordance with\nregulations prescribed by the Secretary, adequately diversified.\n3\nPLR-117887-00\nSection 1.817-5 of the regulations contains the diversification requirements for\nvariable contracts based on segregated asset accounts.  Generally, the investments of\na segregated asset account will be considered to be \"adequately diversified\" for\npurposes of \u00a7 817(h) of the Code and \u00a7 1.817-5 of the regulations if no more than 55\npercent of the value of the total assets of the account is represented by any one\ninvestment, no more than 70 percent by any two investments, no more than 80 percent\nby any three investments, and no more than 90 percent by any four investments.  See\n\u00a7 1.817-5(b)(1).\nSection 1.817-5(f) of the regulations provides a look-through rule for the\napplication of the diversification requirements of  \u00a7 1.817-5.  Section 1.817-5(f)(1)\nprovides that, if the look-through rule applies, a beneficial interest in a regulated\ninvestment company will not be treated as a single investment of a segregated asset\naccount; instead, a pro rata portion of each asset of the investment company will be\ntreated, for purposes of \u00a7 1.817-5, as an asset of the segregated asset account.\nSection 1.817-5(f)(2)(i) of the regulations provides that the look-through rule of\n\u00a7 1.817-5(f) shall apply to an investment company if:\n   \n   (A) all the beneficial interests in the investment company (other than those\ndescribed in \u00a7 1.817-5(f)(3)) are held by one or more segregated asset accounts\nof one or more insurance companies; and   \n   (B) public access to such investment company is available exclusively (except\nas otherwise permitted under \u00a7 1.817-5(f)(3)) through the purchase of a variable\ncontract.  Solely for this purpose, the status of the contract as a variable contract\nwill be determined without regard to \u00a7 817(h) of the Code and \u00a7 1.817-5 of the\nregulations.\nThe beneficial interests described in \u00a7 1.817-5(f)(3) are (i) under specified\ncircumstances, the general account of a life insurance company or a corporation related\nin a manner specified in \u00a7 267(b) of the Code to a life insurance company; (ii) under\nspecified circumstances, the manager, or a corporation related in a manner specified in\n\u00a7 267(b) to the manager of the investment company; (iii) the trustee of a qualified\npension or retirement plan; (iv) the public or policyholders that are treated as owners of\nbeneficial interests in the investment company under Rev. Rul. 81-225, 1981-2 C.B. 12,\nbut only if (A) the investment company was closed to the public in accordance with Rev.\nRul. 82-55, 1982-1 C.B. 12, or (B) all the assets of the segregated asset account are\nattributable to premium payments made by policyholders prior to September 26, 1981,\nto premium payments made in connection with a qualified pension or retirement plan, or\nto any combination of such premium payments.  \nSection 1.817-5(e) of the regulations provides that \u201c[f]or purposes of\nsection 817)(h) of the Code and [\u00a7 1.817-5 of the regulations], a segregated asset\n4\nPLR-117887-00\naccount shall consist of all assets the investment return and market value of each of\nwhich must be allocated in an identical manner to any variable contract invested in any\nof such assets.\u201d \nREQUESTED RULING 1\nCurrently, all interests in Fund 2 and Fund 3 are held by segregated asset\naccounts that fund Variable Contracts (except as otherwise permitted under \u00a7 1.817-\n5(f)(3) of the regulations).  Thus, the requirement set forth in \u00a7 1.817-5(f)(2)(i)(A) for\napplication of the look-through rule to Fund 2 and Fund 3 is satisfied.  It is proposed\nthat Fund 1 acquire shares of Fund 2 and Fund 3.  All interests in Fund 1 are to be held\nby segregated asset accounts that fund Variable Contracts (except as otherwise\npermitted under  \u00a7 1.817-5(f)(3)).  Therefore, after Fund 1 invests in Fund 2 and Fund\n3, all beneficial interests in Fund 2 and Fund 3 (except as otherwise permitted under \n\u00a7 1.817-5(f)(3)) will continue to be held by one or more segregated asset accounts of\none or more insurance companies, satisfying the requirement of \u00a7 1.817-5(f)(2)(i)(A).\nREQUESTED RULINGS 2 and 3\nThe Funds represent that all beneficial interests in Fund 1 will be held only by\nsegregated asset accounts that fund Variable Contracts (except as otherwise permitted\nunder \u00a7 1.817-5(f)(3) of the regulations) and that public access to Fund 1 will be\navailable (directly or indirectly) exclusively (except as otherwise permitted under \n\u00a7 1.817-5(f)(3)) through the purchase of a Variable Contract.  Therefore, the\nrequirements of \u00a7 1.817-5(f)(2)(i) for applying the look-through rule to Fund 1 will be\nsatisfied and a pro rata portion of each asset of Fund 1 will be treated as an asset of a\nsegregated asset account investing in Fund 1.\nWe have concluded above in our consideration of Requested Ruling (1) that,\nafter Fund 1 invests in Fund 2 and Fund 3, the requirement in \u00a7 1.817-5(f)(2)(i)(A) of\nthe regulations for applying the look-through rule to Fund 2 and Fund 3 will continue to\nbe met.  Further, the Funds represent that after Fund 1 invests in Fund 2 and Fund 3\npublic access to Fund 2 and Fund 3 will be available (directly or indirectly) exclusively\n(except as otherwise permitted under \u00a7 1.817-5(f)(3)) through the purchase of a\nVariable Contract.  Thus, both conditions for applying the look-through rule of \u00a7 1.817-\n5(f) to Fund 2 and Fund 3 will be satisfied.  Accordingly, for purposes of determining\nwhether a segregated asset account investing in Fund 1 complies with the\ndiversification requirements of \u00a7 1.817-5, a pro rata portion of each asset of Fund 2 and\nFund 3 will be taken into account.\nFund 1 is considering investing in RICs other than Fund 2 and Fund 3.  Taxpayer\nrepresents that all beneficial interests (except as otherwise permitted under \u00a7 1.817-\n5(f)(3) of the regulations) in such other RICs will be held only by segregated asset\naccounts that fund Variable Contracts and that public access to such other RICs will be\n5\nPLR-117887-00\navailable (directly or indirectly) exclusively (except as otherwise permitted under\n\u00a7 1.817-5(f)(3)) through the purchase of a Variable Contract.  Thus, both requirements\nof \u00a7 1.817-5(f)(2)(i) for the application of the look-through rule will be satisfied with\nrespect to such other RICs.  Therefore, Fund 1's investment in such other RICs, will not\nprevent a segregated asset account holding shares of Fund 1 from looking through to\nthe assets of such other RICs for purposes of determining compliance with the\ndiversification requirements of \u00a7 1.817-5 of the regulations.\nCONCLUSIONS\n1.   Fund 2 and Fund 3 will not fail to satisfy the requirement of \u00a7 1.817-\n5(f)(2)(i)(A) of the regulations by reason of Fund 1 investing in Fund 2 and Fund 3.\n2.  After Fund 1 invests in Fund 2 and Fund 3, segregated asset accounts\ninvesting in Fund 1 will take into account their pro rata share of the assets of Fund 2\nand Fund 3 for purposes of determining whether they comply with the diversification\nrequirements of \u00a7 1.817-5 of the regulations.\n3.  Investment by Fund 1 in RICs other than Fund 2 and Fund 3 will not prevent\nsegregated asset accounts holding shares of Fund 1 from looking through to the assets\nof such other RICs, for purposes of determining whether such other RICs comply with\nthe diversification requirements of \u00a7 1.817-5 of the regulations, as long as all beneficial\ninterests (except as otherwise permitted under \u00a7 1.817-5(f)(3)) in such other RICs are\nheld by segregated asset accounts that fund Variable Contracts and public access to\nsuch other RICs is available (directly or indirectly) exclusively (except as otherwise\npermitted under \u00a7 1.817-5(f)(3)) through the purchase of a Variable Contract.\nThe rulings contained in this letter are based upon information and\nrepresentations submitted by the taxpayers and accompanied by a penalty of perjury\nstatement executed by an appropriate party.

A corporate trustee located in State 1 is Trustee of Trust.  Trust is \ninitially governed under the law of State 1 and Grantor resides in State 2.  Trust is a \nUnited States person under \u00a7 7701(a)(30)(E) of the Internal Revenue Code.  \n \nPart III, Article THIRD of the Trust provides for the creation of a Power of Appointment \nCommittee. The initial members of the Power of Appointment Committee are Grantor, \nNephew, Niece 1, Guardian, and Friend.  Guardian is acting on behalf of Niece 2, who \nis a minor.  If at any time the Power of Appointment Committee includes three or more \nmembers, other than the Grantor, then all the members of the Power of Appointment \nCommittee including the Grantor may by unanimous vote, at any time and from time to \ntime, add one or more members to Power of Appointment Committee provided that \nsuch members are Beneficiaries (i.e., descendants of Nephew, Niece 1, or Niece 2) \nand, provided further that, if any one or more of them is a minor, the members of the \nPower of Appointment Committee shall by unanimous vote designate an individual to \nserve as guardian for such minor.  Each member of the Power of Appointment \nCommittee may resign without prior approval of any court or the consent of any person.  \nIf such a member resigns or fails or ceases to serve, then the position will remain \nvacant.  The members of the Power of Appointment Committee shall not serve or act in \na fiduciary capacity.  Under Part III, Article FOURTH(d) and (g), under no circumstances \nshall Grantor or any of the Beneficiaries act as a guardian and upon the beneficiary \nattaining age eighteen years, his or her guardian shall cease to serve and the \nbeneficiary shall serve as a member of the Power of Appointment Committee. \n \nPart II, Article THIRD of the Trust provides that the Power of Appointment Committee \nshall cease to exist upon the first to occur of the date of the Grantor\u2019s death or the date \non which the Power of Appointment Committee has fewer than two (2) members other \nthan the Grantor.  \n \nPart I, Article FIRST(a)(1) and Part III, Article THIRD(f) of Trust provides that while the \nPower of Appointment Committee is in existence, then, until the Distribution Date \n(defined as the date of Grantor\u2019s death) at any time or times, Trustee shall distribute to \nthe Beneficiaries and/or Grantor such amounts of net income and principal (including \nthe whole thereof) as the Power of Appointment Committee appoints.  While the Power \nof Appointment Committee is in existence, Trust shall make no distributions except as \n \nPLR-103340-19 \n \n3 \nthe Power of Appointment Committee appoints.  Any appointment to one or more \nBeneficiaries and/or Grantor must be made in writing either: \n \n(1) as executed by Grantor and by a majority of the Committee members (Grantor\u2019s \nConsent Power); or  \n(2) as executed by all then serving members of Committee (Unanimous Member \nPower). \n \nIn addition, any appointment to Grantor may also be made in writing, executed by any \none member of the Committee who is also an Adverse Party (Adverse Party Power).  \nAdverse Party is defined in Part II, Article FIRST(c) as having the meaning set forth in \n\u00a7 672(a) of the Internal Revenue Code. \n \nThe Power of Appointment Committee may appoint income or principal equally or \nunequally to or for the benefit of Grantor or any one or more of the Beneficiaries to the \nexclusion of others.   \n \nPart I, Article FIRST(b)(1) provides that if and only if the Power of Appointment \nCommittee is in existence, Grantor shall have the power in a non-fiduciary capacity, at \nany time and from time to time, to appoint to any one or more of the Beneficiaries such \namounts of the principal (including the whole thereof) as Grantor deems advisable to \nprovide for the health, maintenance, support and education of the Beneficiaries \n(Grantor\u2019s First Sole Power). \n \nPart I, Article FIRST(a)(2), (a)(3), and (b)(2) provide that if and only if the Power of \nAppointment Committee ceases to exist, then, until the Distribution Date: \n \n(1) Trustee may, pursuant to a written instrument, at any time or times, distribute to \nthe Beneficiaries such amounts of the net income or principal of Trust (including \nthe whole thereof) as Trustee determines.  In determining whether to make any \ndistributions to the Beneficiaries, Trustee is required to take into consideration \nthe distributee\u2019s own income and property and any other income or property \nwhich any individual provides or is obligated to provide; \n(2) Trustee may, with and only with the consent of an Adverse Party, distribute to \nGrantor such amounts of the net income or principal of Trust (including the whole \nthereof) as Trustee determines; \n(3) Grantor shall have the power in a non-fiduciary capacity, at any time and from \ntime to time, to appoint such amounts of the net income or principal of Trust \n(including the whole thereof) to any one or more of the Grantor\u2019s Family, other \nthan Grantor, Grantor\u2019s estate, Grantor\u2019s creditors or the creditors of Grantor\u2019s \nestate (Grantor\u2019s Second Sole Power).  Grantor\u2019s Family is defined in Part II, \nArticle FIRST(q) as the Grantor, the issue of the Grantor\u2019s grandparents, all \nClose Persons and all charities.  A Close Person is defined in Part II, Article \nFIRST(j) as an individual determined by the Trustee to be a close personal, \nbusiness or professional associate of the Grantor and each of the issue of any \n \nPLR-103340-19 \n \n4 \nsuch individual other than any such issue who is expressly excluded by the \nTrustee.       \n \nAdditionally, under Part I, Article FIRST(a)(1) and (c)(1) the Power of Appointment \nCommittee and Trustee have the power, until the Distribution Date, to appoint all or any \nportion of Trust to any one or more Qualified Trusts.  Part II, Article FIRST(dd) defines a \nQualified Trust as a trust that benefits one or more members of the Grantor\u2019s Family \nand complies with certain other technical requirements.  The Power of Appointment \nCommittee may exercise this power under the Grantor\u2019s Consent Power, the \nUnanimous Member Power, and the Adverse Party Power. \n \nUnder Part II, Article THIRD(a), no distribution by Trustee to a beneficiary and no \ndistributions to a beneficiary pursuant to a power of appointment granted hereunder, \nshall discharge any individual\u2019s legal obligation to support the beneficiary. \n \nPart II, Article EIGHTH(j)(2) provides that any power retained by Grantor shall be \nexercisable in a non-fiduciary capacity. \n \nPart I, Article FIRST(e) provides that upon the death of the Grantor, Trustee shall \ndistribute the remainder of the trust to or for the benefit of any person or entity or \nentities, other than the Grantor\u2019s estate, the Grantor\u2019s creditors, or the creditors of the \nGrantor\u2019s estate, as Grantor appoints by will.  Part I, Article FIRST(f) provides that, in \ndefault of this appointment, ten percent of any undistributed property will be distributed \nin trust for Friend, if Friend is then serving on the Power of Appointment Committee, and \nthe balance in equal shares in trust for Nephew and his issue, Niece 1 and her issue, \nand Niece 2 and her issue (Grantor\u2019s Testamentary Power).    \n \nYou have requested the following rulings: \n \n1.  As long as the Power of Appointment Committee is serving, no portion of the items \nof income, deductions, and credits against tax of the Trust shall be included in \ncomputing under \u00a7 671 the taxable income, deductions, and credits of Grantor or any \nmember of the Power of Appointment Committee. \n \n2.  The contribution of property to Trust by Grantor will not be a completed gift subject to \nfederal gift tax. \n \n3.  Any distribution of property by the Power of Appointment Committee from Trust to \nGrantor will not be a completed gift, subject to federal gift tax, by any member of the \nPower of Appointment Committee. \n \n4.  Any distribution of property by the Power of Appointment Committee from Trust to \nany beneficiary of Trust, other than to Grantor, will not be a completed gift subject to \nfederal gift tax, by any member of the Power of Appointment Committee. \n \n \nPLR-103340-19 \n \n5 \n5.  No member of the Power of Appointment Committee upon his or her death will \ninclude in his or her estate any property held in Trust because such member is deemed \nto have a general power of appointment within the meaning of \u00a7 2041 over property \nheld in Trust. \n \nRULING 1 \n \nSection 671 provides that where it is specified in subpart E of part I of subchapter J that \nthe grantor or another person shall be treated as the owner of any portion of a trust, \nthere shall then be included in computing the taxable income and credits of the grantor \nor the other person those items of income, deductions, and credits against tax of the \ntrust which are attributable to that portion of the trust to the extent that such items would \nbe taken into account under chapter 1 in computing taxable income or credits against \nthe tax of an individual. \n \nSection 672(a) provides, for purposes of subpart E, the term \u201cadverse party\u201d means any \nperson having a substantial beneficial interest in the trust which would be adversely \naffected by the exercise or nonexercise of the power which he possesses respecting the \ntrust. \n \nSections 673 through 677 specify the circumstances under which the grantor is treated \nas the owner of a portion of a trust. \n \nSection 673(a) provides that the grantor shall be treated as the owner of any portion of \na trust in which the grantor has a reversionary interest in either the corpus or the income \ntherefrom, if, as of the inception of that portion of the trust, the value of such interest \nexceeds five (5) percent of the value of such portion. \n \nSection 674(a) provides, in general, that the grantor shall be treated as the owner of any \nportion of a trust in respect of which the beneficial enjoyment of the corpus or the \nincome therefrom is subject to a power of disposition, exercisable by the grantor or a \nnonadverse party, or both, without the approval or consent of any adverse party. \n \nSection 674(b) provides that \u00a7 674(a) shall not apply to the powers described in \n\u00a7 674(b) regardless of whom held. \n \nSection 674(b)(3) provides that \u00a7 674(a) shall not apply to a power exercisable only by \nwill, other than a power in the grantor to appoint by will the income of the trust where the \nincome is accumulated for such disposition by the grantor or may be so accumulated in \nthe discretion of the grantor or a nonadverse party, or both, without the approval or \nconsent of any adverse party. \n \nSection 674(b)(5) provides that \u00a7 674(a) shall not apply to a power to distribute corpus \nto or for a beneficiary, provided that the power is limited by a reasonably definite \nstandard. \n \nPLR-103340-19 \n \n6 \n \nUnder \u00a7 675 and applicable regulations, the grantor is treated as the owner of any \nportion of a trust if, under the terms of the trust agreement or circumstances attendant \non its operation, administrative control is exercisable primarily for the benefit of the \ngrantor rather than the beneficiary of the trust. \n \nSection 676(a) provides that the grantor shall be treated as the owner of any portion of \na trust, whether or not he is treated as such owner under any other provision of part I, \nsubchapter J, chapter 1, where at any time the power to revest in the grantor title to \nsuch portion is exercisable by the grantor or a nonadverse party, or both. \n \nSection 677(a) provides, in general, that the grantor shall be treated as the owner of any \nportion of a trust, whether or not he is treated as such owner under \u00a7 674, whose \nincome without the approval or consent of any adverse party is, or, in the discretion of \nthe grantor or a nonadverse party, or both, may be (1) distributed to the grantor or the \ngrantor's spouse; (2) held or accumulated for future distribution to the grantor or the \ngrantor's spouse; or (3) applied to the payment of premiums on policies of insurance on \nthe life of the grantor or the grantor's spouse. \n \nSection 678(a) provides that a person other than the grantor shall be treated as the \nowner of any portion of a trust with respect to which: (1) such person has a power \nexercisable solely by himself to vest the corpus or the income therefrom in himself, or \n(2) such person has previously partially released or otherwise modified such a power \nand after the release or modification retains such control as would, within the principles \nof \u00a7\u00a7 671-677, inclusive, subject a grantor of a trust to treatment as the owner thereof.  \n \nSection 679(a) provides that a United States person who directly or indirectly transfers \nproperty to a foreign trust shall be treated as the owner for his taxable year of the \nportion of such trust attributable to such property if for such year there is a United States \nbeneficiary of any portion of the trust. \n \nBased solely on the facts and representations submitted and except as caveated below, \nwe conclude an examination of Trust reveals none of the circumstances that would \ncause Grantor to be treated as the owner of any portion of Trust under \u00a7\u00a7 673, 674, \n676, 677, or 679 as long as Trust is a domestic trust and the Power of Appointment \nCommittee remains in existence and serving.  Because none of the members of Power \nof Appointment Committee have a power exercisable by himself to vest trust income or \ncorpus in himself, none shall be treated as the owner of Trust under \u00a7 678(a). \n \n \nWe further conclude that an examination of Trust reveals none of the circumstances \nthat would cause administrative controls to be considered exercisable primarily for the \nbenefit of Grantor under \u00a7 675. Thus, the circumstances attendant on the operation of \nTrust will determine whether Grantor will be treated as the owner of any portion of Trust \nunder \u00a7 675.  This is a question of fact, the determination of which must be deferred \n \nPLR-103340-19 \n \n7 \nuntil the federal income tax returns of the parties involved have been examined by the \noffice with responsibility for such examination. \n \nLastly, no opinion is expressed or implied regarding the income tax consequences of \nany provision permitting the Trustee to distribute income or principal pursuant to the \nPower of Appointment Committee\u2019s exercise of the Adverse Party Power.  Further, no \nopinion is expressed or implied regarding the income tax consequences of any other \nprovision of Trust not referenced in this private letter ruling. \n \nRULINGS 2 AND 3 \n \nSection 2501(a)(1) provides for the imposition of a gift tax on the transfer of property by \ngift.  Section 2511(a) provides that the gift tax applies whether the transfer is in trust or \notherwise, whether the gift is direct or indirect, and whether the property is real or \npersonal, tangible or intangible. \n \nSection 25.2511-2(b) of the Gift Tax Regulations provides that a gift is complete as to \nany property with respect to which the donor has so parted with dominion and control as \nto leave the donor with no power to change the disposition of the property, whether for \nthe donor's own benefit, or for the benefit of another.  But if upon a transfer of property \n(whether in trust or otherwise) the donor reserves any power over its disposition, the gift \nmay be wholly incomplete, or may be partially complete and partially incomplete, \ndepending upon all the facts in the particular case.  Accordingly, in every case of a \ntransfer of property subject to a reserved power, the terms of the power must be \nexamined and its scope determined. \n \nSection 25.2511-2(b) provides an example, where the donor transfers property in trust \nto pay the income to the donor, or accumulate it in the discretion of the trustee, and the \ndonor retains a testamentary power to appoint the remainder among the donor's \ndescendants.  The regulation concludes that no portion of the transfer is a completed \ngift.  However, if the donor had not retained a testamentary power of appointment, but \nhad instead provided that the remainder should go to X or his heirs, the entire transfer \nwould be a completed gift. \n \nSection 25.2511-2(c) provides that a gift is incomplete in every instance in which a \ndonor reserves the power to revest the beneficial title in himself or herself.  A gift is also \nincomplete if and to the extent that a reserved power gives the donor the power to name \nnew beneficiaries or to change the interests of the beneficiaries as between themselves \nunless the power is a fiduciary power limited by a fixed or ascertainable standard. \nSection 25.2511-2(f) provides that the relinquishment or termination of a power to \nchange the beneficiaries of transferred property, occurring otherwise than by death of \nthe donor, is regarded as an event which completes the gift and causes the gift tax to \napply. \n \n \nPLR-103340-19 \n \n8 \nSection 25.2511-2(g) provides that if a donor transfers property to himself as trustee (or \nto himself and some other person, not possessing a substantial adverse interest, as \ntrustees), and retains no beneficial interest in the trust property and no power over it \nexcept fiduciary powers, the exercise or nonexercise of which is limited by a fixed or \nascertainable standard, to change the beneficiaries of the transferred property, the \ndonor has made a completed gift. \n \nUnder \u00a7 25.2511-2(e), a donor is considered as possessing a power if it is exercisable \nby the donor in conjunction with any person not having a substantial adverse interest in \nthe disposition of the transferred property.  Section 25.2511-2(f) provides that the \nrelinquishment or termination of a power to change the beneficiaries of transferred \nproperty, occurring otherwise than by death of the donor, is regarded as the event which \ncompletes the gift and causes the gift tax to apply. \n \nSection 25.2511-2(e) does not define \u201csubstantial adverse interest.\u201d   \n \nSection 25.2514-3(b)(2) provides, in part, that a taker in default of appointment under a \npower has an interest that is adverse to an exercise of the power.  Section 25.2514-\n3(b)(2) also provides that a co-holder of a power is considered as having an adverse \ninterest where he may possess the power after the possessor's death and may exercise \nit at that time in favor of himself, his estate, his creditors, or the creditors of his estate. \n \nIn Estate of Sanford v. Commissioner, 308 U.S. 39 (1939), the taxpayer created a trust \nfor the benefit of named beneficiaries and reserved the power to revoke the trust in \nwhole or in part, and to designate new beneficiaries other than himself.  Six years later, \nin 1919, the taxpayer relinquished the power to revoke the trust, but retained the right to \nchange the beneficiaries.  In 1924, the taxpayer relinquished the right to change the \nbeneficiaries.  The Court stated that the taxpayer's gift is not complete, for purposes of \nthe gift tax, when the donor has reserved the power to determine those others who \nwould ultimately receive the property.  Accordingly, the Court held that the taxpayer's \ngift was complete in 1924, when he relinquished his right to change the beneficiaries of \nthe trust.  A's retention of a power to change the beneficial interests in a trust causes \nthe transfer to the trust to be incomplete for gift tax purposes, even though the power \nmay be defeated by the actions of third parties.  Goldstein v. Commissioner, 37 T.C. \n897 (1962).  See also Estate of Goelet v. Commissioner, 51 T.C. 352 (1968). \n \nIn this case, Grantor retained the Grantor's Consent Power over the income and \nprincipal of Trust.  Under \u00a7 25.2511-2(e), a donor is considered as himself having a \npower if it is exercisable by him in conjunction with any person not having a substantial \nadverse interest in the disposition of the transferred property or the income therefrom. \nPower of Appointment Committee members are not takers in default for purposes of \n\u00a7 25.2514-3(b)(2).  They are merely co-holders of the power.  Under \u00a7 25.2514-3(b)(2), \na co-holder of a power is only considered as having an adverse interest where he may \npossess the power after the possessor's death and may exercise it at that time in favor \nof himself, his estate, his creditors, or the creditors of his estate.  In this case, the Power \n \nPLR-103340-19 \n \n9 \nof Appointment Committee ceases to exist upon Grantor's death.  Accordingly, the \nPower of Appointment Committee members do not have interests adverse to Grantor \nunder \u00a7 25.2514-3(b)(2) and for purposes of \u00a7 25.2511-2(e).  Therefore, Grantor is \nconsidered as possessing the power to distribute income and principal to any \nbeneficiary himself because he retained the Grantor's Consent Power.  \n \nGrantor also retained Grantor's First Sole Power over the principal of Trust (held while \nthe Power of Appointment Committee is in existence) and Grantor\u2019s Second Sole Power \nover the income and principal of Trust (held after the Power of Appointment Committee \ndissolves).  Under \u00a7 25.2511-2(c), a gift is incomplete if and to the extent that a \nreserved power gives the donor the power to name new beneficiaries or to change the \ninterests of the beneficiaries as between themselves unless the power is a fiduciary \npower limited by a fixed or ascertainable standard.  In this case, the Grantor's First and \nSecond Sole Powers give Grantor the power to change the interests of the \nbeneficiaries.  Grantor's First and Second Sole Powers are non-fiduciary powers.  Even \nthough Grantor will relinquish Grantor\u2019s First Sole Power, Grantor reserves Grantor\u2019s \nSecond Sole Power over a different class of appointees.  Accordingly, the retention of \nGrantor's First and Second Sole Powers causes the transfer of property to Trust to be \nwholly incomplete for federal gift tax purposes when Grantor contributes property to \nTrust.  The transfer will continue to be incomplete in the event that the Power of \nAppointment Committee dissolves prior to Grantor\u2019s death. \n \nFurther, Grantor retained Grantor's Testamentary Power to appoint the property in Trust \nto any persons, other than Grantor's estate, Grantor's creditors, or the creditors of \nGrantor's estate.  Under \u00a7 25.2514-3(b)(2), the retention of a testamentary power to \nappoint the remainder of a trust is considered a retention of dominion and control over \nthe remainder.  Accordingly, the retention of this power causes the transfer of property \nto Trust to be incomplete with respect to the remainder in Trust for federal tax purposes.   \n \nFinally, the Power of Appointment Committee members possess the Unanimous \nMember Power and the Adverse Party Power over income and principal.  These powers \nare not conditions precedent to Grantor's powers.  Grantor's powers over the income \nand principal are presently exercisable and not subject to a condition precedent.  \nGrantor retains dominion and control over the income and principal of Trust until the \nPower of Appointment Committee members exercise their Unanimous Member Power \nor Adverse Party Power.  Accordingly, the Unanimous Member Power and the Adverse \nParty Power do not cause the transfer of property to be complete with respect to the \nincome and principal interests in Trust for federal gift tax purposes.   \n \nIf the Power of Appointment Committee ceases to exist, the Trustee, in its fiduciary \ncapacity, also has the power to distribute net income or principal to one or more \nBeneficiaries.  The powers of the Trustee are not conditions precedent to the Grantor\u2019s \npowers.  Grantor\u2019s Consent Power over income and principal and Grantor\u2019s First Sole \nPower over principal are presently exercisable and not subject to a condition precedent.  \nAdditionally, Grantor\u2019s Second Sole Power over income and principal is exercisable \n \nPLR-103340-19 \n \n10 \nimmediately after the Power of Appointment Committee ceases to exist and is not \nsubject to a condition precedent.  Accordingly, Grantor retains dominion and control \nover the principal of Trust until the Trustee exercises its power to appoint income or \nprincipal.  Thus, the Trustee\u2019s power to distribute net income or principal does not cause \nthe transfer of property to Trust to be complete for federal gift tax purposes.  \nAccordingly, the retention of the Grantor\u2019s Consent Power, the Grantor\u2019s First Sole \nPower, and the Grantor\u2019s Second Sole Power causes the transfer of property to Trust to \nbe wholly incomplete for federal gift tax purposes.   \n \nAccordingly, based on the facts submitted and the representations made, we conclude \nthat the contribution of property to Trust by Grantor is not a completed gift subject to \nfederal gift tax.  Any distribution from Trust to Grantor is merely a return of Grantor's \nproperty.  Therefore, we conclude that any distribution of property by the Power of \nAppointment Committee from Trust to Grantor will not be a completed gift subject to \nfederal gift tax, by any member of the Power of Appointment Committee.  Further, upon \nGrantor's death, the fair market value of the property in Trust is includible in Grantor's \ngross estate for federal estate tax purposes. \n \nRULINGS 4 AND 5 \n \nSection 2514(b) provides that the exercise or release of a general power of appointment \ncreated after October 21, 1942, shall be deemed a transfer of property by the individual \npossessing such power. \n \nSection 2514(c) provides that the term \u201cgeneral power of appointment\u201d means a power \nwhich is exercisable in favor of the individual possessing the power (possessor), the \npossessor's estate, the possessor's creditors, or the creditors of the possessor's estate. \n \nSection 25.2514-1(c)(1) provides that a power of appointment is not a general power if \nby its terms it is exercisable only in favor of one or more designated persons or classes \nother than the possessor or his creditors, or the possessor's estate or the creditors of \nthe estate. \n \nSection 2514(c)(3)(A) provides that, in the case of a power of appointment created after \nOctober 21, 1942, if the power is exercisable by the possessor only in conjunction with \nthe creator of the power, such power is not deemed a general power of appointment. \n \nSection 2514(c)(3)(B) provides, that in the case of a power of appointment created after \nOctober 21, 1942, if the power is not exercisable by the possessor except in conjunction \nwith a person having a substantial interest in the property subject to the power, which is \nadverse to the exercise of the power in favor of the possessor, such power shall not be \ndeemed a general power of appointment.  For purposes of \u00a7 2514(c)(3)(B), a person \nwho, after the death of the possessor, may be possessed of a power of appointment \n(with respect to the property subject to the possessor's power) which he may exercise in \n \nPLR-103340-19 \n \n11 \nhis own favor shall be deemed as having an interest in the property and such interest \nshall be deemed adverse to such exercise of the possessor's power. \n \nSection 25.2514-3(b)(2) provides, in part, that a co-holder of a power has no adverse \ninterest merely because of his joint possession of the power nor merely because he is a \npermissible appointee under a power.  However, a co-holder of a power is considered \nas having an adverse interest where he may possess the power after the possessor's \ndeath and may exercise it at that time in favor of himself, his estate, his creditors, or the \ncreditors of his estate.  Thus, for example, if X, Y, and Z held a power jointly to appoint \namong a group of persons which includes themselves and if on the death of X the \npower will pass to Y and Z jointly, then Y and Z are considered to have interests \nadverse to the exercise of the power in favor of X. Similarly, if on Y's death the power \nwill pass to Z, Z is considered to have an interest adverse to the exercise of the power \nin favor of Y. \n \nSection 2041(a)(2) provides that the value of the gross estate shall include the value of \nall property to the extent of any property with respect to which the decedent has at the \ntime of death a general power of appointment created after October 21, 1942, or with \nrespect to which the decedent has at any time exercised or released such a power by a \ndisposition which is of such nature that if it were a transfer of property owned by the \ndecedent, such property would be includible in the decedent's gross estate under \n\u00a7\u00a7 2035 to 2038, inclusive. \n \nUnder \u00a7 2041(b)(1), the term \u201cgeneral power of appointment\u201d is defined, in relevant part, \nto mean a power which is exercisable in favor of the decedent, his estate, his creditors, \nor the creditors of his estate. \n \nSection 2041(b)(1)(C)(ii) provides, however, that in the case of a power of appointment \ncreated after October 21, 1942, if the power is not exercisable by the decedent except \nin conjunction with a person having a substantial interest in the property, subject to the \npower, which is adverse to the exercise of the power in favor of the decedent\u2014such \npower shall not be deemed a general power of appointment.  For purposes of \n\u00a7 2041(b)(1)(C)(ii), a person who, after the death of the decedent, may be possessed of \na power of appointment (with respect to the property subject to the decedent's power) \nwhich he may exercise in his own favor shall be deemed as having an interest in the \nproperty and such interest shall be deemed adverse to such exercise of the decedent's \npower. \n \nSection 20.2041-3(c)(2) of the Estate Tax Regulations provides, in part, that a co-holder \nof a power of appointment has no adverse interest merely because of his joint \npossession of the power nor merely because he is a permissible appointee under a \npower.  However, a co-holder of a power is considered as having an adverse interest \nwhere he may possess the power after the decedent's death and may exercise it at that \ntime in favor of himself, his estate, his creditors, or the creditors of his estate.  Thus, for \nexample, if X, Y, and Z held a power jointly to appoint among a group of persons which \n \nPLR-103340-19 \n \n12 \nincludes themselves and if on the death of X the power will pass to Y and Z jointly, then \nY and Z are considered to have interests adverse to the exercise of the power in favor \nof X.  Similarly, if on Y's death the power will pass to Z, Z is considered to have an \ninterest adverse to the exercise of the power in favor of Y. \n \nThe powers held by the Power of Appointment Committee members under the Grantor's \nConsent Power are powers that are exercisable only in conjunction with the creator, \nGrantor.  Accordingly, under \u00a7\u00a7 2514(b) and 2041(a)(2), the Power of Appointment \nCommittee members do not possess general powers of appointment by virtue of \npossessing this power.  The powers held by the Power of Appointment Committee \nmembers under the Unanimous Member Power are not general powers of appointment \nfor purposes of \u00a7\u00a7 2514(b) and 2041(a)(2).  As in the examples in \u00a7\u00a7 25.2514-3(b)(2) \nand 20.2041-3(c)(2), the Power of Appointment Committee members have substantial \nadverse interests in the property subject to this power.   \n \nThe powers held by the Power of Appointment Committee members under the Adverse \nParty Power are not general powers of appointment for purposes of \u00a7\u00a7 2514(b) and \n2041(a)(2).  Sections 2514(c) and 2041(b)(1) provide that the term general power of \nappointment means a power which is exercisable in favor of the individual possessing \nthe power (possessor), the possessor's estate, the possessor's creditors, or the \ncreditors of the possessor's estate.  Under the terms of the Adverse Party Power, the \npower is only exercisable by someone who is an adverse party with respect to the \ndistribution.  The possessor of a power cannot be an adverse party with respect to a \ndistribution to himself, his estate, his creditors or the creditors of his estate.  Therefore, \nthe Adverse Party Power can never be exercised in favor of the possessor, his estate, \nhis creditors or the creditors of estate, and, as a result, is not a general power of \nappointment.      \n \nAccordingly, any distributions made from Trust to a beneficiary pursuant to the exercise \nof these powers (the Grantor's Consent Power, the Unanimous Member Powers and the \nAdverse Party Power) are not gifts by the Power of Appointment Committee members. \n \nBased on the facts submitted and representations made, we conclude that any \ndistribution of property by the Power of Appointment Committee from Trust to any \nbeneficiary of Trust, other than Grantor, will not be a completed gift subject to federal \ngift tax, by any member of the Power of Appointment Committee.  Further, we conclude \nthat any distribution of property from Trust to a beneficiary other than Grantor will be a \ncompleted gift by Grantor.  Finally, we conclude that the powers held by the Power of \nAppointment Committee are not general powers of appointment for purposes of \n\u00a7 2041(a)(2) and, accordingly, no member of the Power of Appointment Committee \nupon his or her death will include in his or her estate any property held in Trust because \nsuch member is deemed to have a general power of appointment within the meaning of \n\u00a7 2041 over property held in Trust.   \n \n \nPLR-103340-19 \n \n13 \nExcept as specifically ruled herein, we express no opinion on the federal tax \nconsequences of the transaction under the cited provisions or under any other \nprovisions of the Code. Specifically, we express no opinion on the trust provisions \npermitting Trustee to distribute income or principal to trustees of other qualified trusts \n(decanting). \n \n \nSincerely, \n \n \nFaith P.

The Taxpayers request a ruling on\nwhether the proposed contributions of shares of Company 1 ADSs (defined below) to\none or more private foundations or charitable remainder trusts of which private\nfoundations are or may be remaindermen constitute contributions of \u201cqualified\nappreciated stock\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 170(e)(5) of the Internal Revenue Code.\nRULING REQUESTED\nThe Taxpayers request the following ruling:\nDo the Company 1 ADSs that the Taxpayers plan to contribute to the Donees constitute\n\"qualified appreciated stock\" within the meaning of \u00a7 170(e)(5)(B) of the Internal\nRevenue Code?\nCONCLUSION\nYes.  The Company 1 ADSs that the Taxpayers plan to contribute to the Donees\nconstitute \"qualified appreciated stock\" within the meaning of \u00a7 170(e)(5)(B).\nFACTS\nImmediately prior to the merger transactions described below, Partnership, a general\npartnership, the sole partners of which are the Taxpayers and Trustees of trusts for the\nbenefit of the Taxpayers under the Trust, owned common shares of Company 2 for a\nperiod exceeding one year.\nIn Year, Company 2, Company 3, and Company 4 completed a series of merger\ntransactions, which resulted in the formation of Company 1 (the Merger).\nPursuant to the Merger, Partnership received Company 1 American Depository Shares\n(ADSs) in exchange for its Company 2 common shares.  An ADS is issued by as U.S.\ndepository bank and represents an interest in the underlying ordinary shares of a non-\nU.S. company.  An ADS is evidenced by an American Depository Receipt (an ADR). \nAn ADR is a negotiable receipt issued in certificate form representing an ADS.  The\n3\nPLR-112101-02\nholder of an ADR is entitled to demand delivery of the underlying shares.  Each\nCompany 1 ADS represents one ordinary share of Company 1.  The number of\nCompany 1 ADSs received was determined pursuant to a specific exchange ratio for\neach Company 2 common share owned.  The Company 1 ADSs are traded on the New\nYork Stock Exchange.  The Company 1 ADSs are the equivalent of an ADR pursuant to\nthe Merger agreement, which states that direct holders of Company 1 ADSs whose\nownership is registered on the books of the depository are Company 1 ADR holders.\nPartnership is prepared to distribute a portion of its Company 1 ADSs to the Trustees of\nTrust, and the Trustees of Trust, in turn, are prepared to distribute those Company 1\nADSs to the Taxpayers.  The Taxpayers presently intend to contribute some\nCompany 1 ADSs to one or more private foundations or charitable remainder trusts of\nwhich private foundations may be the remaindermen (the Donees).  At the time of the\ncontributions, the foundations will be private foundations within the meaning of\n\u00a7 509(a), and not foundations described in \u00a7 170(b)(1)(E).  Each charitable remainder\ntrust will be for the benefit of a Taxpayer (or a Taxpayer and one or more family\nmembers of the Taxpayer, or just for one or more family members of a Taxpayer) for a\nspecified period and, at the end of such period, will terminate and the assets will pass\nto one or more charitable organizations, which may be private foundations.\nIt is anticipated that the basis of the Company 1 ADS to be contributed by each\nTaxpayer will be less than the fair market value on the dates of the contributions.\nThe total value of the Company 1 ADS to be contributed to the Donees by all of the\nTaxpayers will be less than 10% (in value) of the outstanding Company 1 stock\n(including ADSs).\nThe Company 1 ADSs that the Taxpayers propose to contribute are subject to certain\ncontractual and statutory limitations on their transferability.\nIn connection with the Merger, Partnership, certain Taxpayers and other members of\nthe Family and other entities related to the Family (the Family Shareholders) entered\ninto the Governance Agreement with Company 1.  Under the Governance Agreement,\nthe Family Shareholders may contribute Company 1 ADSs to the Donees without\nrestriction.  Such contributed Company 1 ADSs may be sold by the Donees without\nrestriction.\nThe Company 1 ADSs acquired by Donees pursuant to the proposed transaction will be\nsubject to Rule 145 of the General Rules and Regulations promulgated under the\nSecurities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act), because such securities were\noriginally acquired in the Merger.  The Merger constituted a Rule 145(a) transaction\nunder that rule.  Rule 145 of the Securities Act imposes certain limitations on the \"offer\"\nor \"sale\" of securities acquired in a Rule 145(a) transaction.  In general, Rule 145 of the\nSecurities Act, 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 230.145 (2001), provides that securities acquired in a \u201cRule\n4\nPLR-112101-02\n145(a) transaction\u201d such as the Merger may be resold without the selling party being\ndeemed an underwriter of registered securities under the Securities Act if certain\nprovisions of Rule 144 are followed.  In particular, the following conditions must be met:\n1. adequate current information is available about the issuer of the securities prior to\nresale;\n2. the amount of restricted securities sold in any three-month period is limited to the\ngreater of (i) one percent of the shares outstanding as shown by the then most\nrecent report or statement published by the issuer, and (ii) the average weekly\nreported trading volume of the shares during the four calendar weeks preceding the\nsale; and\n3. the securities may only be sold in \"brokers transactions\" within the meaning of\nSection 4(4) of the Act.\nThe Taxpayers have taken steps to ensure that the Donees will be able to sell the\ncontributed ADSs in compliance with Rule 145.  The Taxpayers represent that the\naggregate contributions to the Donees will be limited such that the total number of\nCompany 1 ADSs contributed by the Taxpayers to the Donees (including any ADSs\nalready held by Donees) will be substantially less than 1% of the shares outstanding of\nCompany 1 as shown by the most recent report or statement published by Company 1. \nThe Taxpayers also represent that contributions will be made by the Donees only at\nsuch times when, to the best of their knowledge, there will not be any proposed\nrecapitalization, tender or exchange offer, stock repurchase program or similar plan that\nwould have the effect of substantially reducing the number of outstanding shares of\nCompany 1 within the 3-month period following the contribution.\nThe Taxpayers will, prior to the proposed contribution, provide a statement to the\nDonees that the requirements of Rule 145 are met for all transfers of the Company 1\nADSs by the Taxpayers and that the Taxpayers will not take any steps that will prevent\nthe Donees from making transfers of Company 1 ADSs free of any Rule 145 resale\nrestrictions.\nThe Taxpayers represent that, at the time of the contributions, the contributed\nCompany 1 ADSs (i) in the hands of each of Partnership and the Taxpayers will be\ndeemed, under \u00a7 1223(1) to have been held by each of Partnership and the Taxpayers\nfor more than one year from the date such ADSs were acquired by each of them and (ii)\nwill not come within any of the exceptions set forth in subsections (1) through (5) of\n\u00a7 1221.  In addition, the Taxpayers anticipate that the fair market value of the Company\n1 ADSs on the contribution date will be more than the adjusted basis of the ADSs.\n5\nPLR-112101-02\nLAW\nSection 170(a) of the Code allows a deduction for any charitable contribution (as\ndefined in \u00a7 170(c)) payment of which is made within the taxable year.\nSection 1.170A-1(c)(1) of the Income Tax Regulations states that if a charitable\ncontribution is made in property other than money, the amount of the contribution is the\nfair market value of the property at the time of the contribution reduced as provided in\n\u00a7 170(e)(1) and paragraph (a) of \u00a7 1.170A-4.\nSection 170(e)(1)(B)(ii) of the Code provides that in the case of charitable contributions\nto or for the use of a private foundation (as defined in \u00a7 509(a)), other than a private\nfoundation described in \u00a7 170(b)(1)(E), the amount of the charitable contribution of\nproperty otherwise taken into account under \u00a7 170 is reduced by the amount of gain\nthat would have been long-term capital gain if the property contributed had been sold by\nthe taxpayer at its fair market value (determined at the time of the contribution).\nSection 170(e)(5)(A) of the Code states that \u00a7 170(e)(1)(B)(ii) does not apply to any\ncontributions of \"qualified appreciated stock.\"\nSection 170(e)(5)(B) of the Code defines \"qualified appreciated stock,\" except as\nprovided in \u00a7 170(e)(5)(C), to mean any stock of a corporation (i) for which (as of the\ndate of the contribution) market quotations are readily available on an established\nsecurities market, and (ii) which is capital gain property (as defined in\n\u00a7 170(b)(1)(C)(iv)).\nSection 170(e)(5)(C)(i) of the Code provides that, in the case of any donor, the term\n\"qualified appreciated stock\" shall not include any stock of a corporation contributed by\nthe donor in a contribution to which \u00a7 170(e)(1)(B)(ii) applies (determined without regard\nto \u00a7 170(e)(5)) to the extent that the amount of the stock so contributed (when\nincreased by the aggregate amount of all prior such contributions by the donor of stock\nin such corporation) exceeds 10 percent (in value) of all of the outstanding stock of\nsuch corporation.  For purposes of \u00a7 170(e)(5)(C)(i), an individual shall be treated as\nmaking all contributions made by any member of his family (as defined in \u00a7 267(c)(4)). \nSection 170(e)(5)(C)(ii).\nSection 170(b)(1)(C)(iv) of the Code defines the term \"capital gain property\" to mean,\nwith respect to any contribution, any capital asset the sale of which at its fair market\nvalue at the time of the contribution would have resulted in gain which would have been\nlong-term capital gain.\nSection 1222(3) of the Code defines \"long-term capital gain\" to mean gain from the sale\nor exchange of a capital asset held for more than one year, if and to the extent the gain\nis taken into account in computing gross income.\n6\nPLR-112101-02\nSection 1221 of the Code defines the term \"capital asset\" to mean property held by the\ntaxpayer (whether or not connected with his trade or business) but does not include (1)\nstock in trade; (2) certain property used in a trade or business; (3) certain property that\nis the product of the taxpayer's personal efforts; (4) accounts or notes receivable; (5)\ncertain publications of the United States government; (6) certain commodities derivative\nfinancial instruments; (7) certain hedging transactions; and (8) certain supplies.\nANALYSIS\nFor stock to be \"qualified appreciated stock,\" it must meet the requirements of\n\u00a7 170(e)(5)(B) of the Code.\nSection 170(e)(5)(B)(i) requires that market quotations for the stock be readily available\non an established securities market as of the date of the contribution.  The market\nquotations requirement has the same meaning for the purpose of defining qualified\nappreciated stock and in determining when securities are publicly traded (so as to\nexempt a donor from the substantiation requirements of \u00a7 1.170A-13(c)).  Todd v.\nCommissioner, 118 T.C. 354 (April 19, 2002).  The definition of an established\nsecurities market for purposes of determining when securities are publicly traded (so as\nto exempt a donor from the substantiation requirements) is in \u00a7 1.170A-13(c)(7)(xi) of\nthe regulations.  Section 1.170A-13(c)(7)(xi)(A)(1) provides that, for purposes of\n\u00a7 1.170A-13, market quotations are readily available on an established securities\nmarket with respect to a security if the \u201csecurity is listed on the New York Stock\nExchange, the American Stock Exchange, or any city or regional exchange in which\nquotations are published on a daily basis, including foreign securities listed on a\nrecognized foreign, national, or regional exchange in which quotations are published on\na daily basis.\u201d  Company 1 ADSs are traded on the New York Stock Exchange. \nAccordingly, market quotations for Company 1 ADSs are readily available on an\nestablished securities market.\nWe further conclude that Company 1 ADSs are stock for purposes of \u00a7 170(e)(5).  An\nADS is issued by a U.S. depository bank and represents an interest in the underlying\nordinary shares of a non-U.S. company.  An ADS is evidenced by an American\nDepository Receipt (an ADR).  An ADR is a negotiable receipt issued in certificate form\nrepresenting an ADS.  The holder of an ADR is entitled to demand delivery of the\nunderlying shares.  Each Company 1 ADS represents one ordinary share of\nCompany 1.  The Company 1 ADSs are the equivalent of an ADR pursuant to the\nMerger agreement, which states that direct holders of Company 1 ADSs whose\nownership is registered on the books of the depository are Company 1 ADR holders. \nThe Service has interpreted ADRs to be treated as shares of stock for various tax\npurposes, such as the foreign tax credit, Rev. Rul. 65-218, 1965-2 C.B. 566, and the\ninterest equalization tax, Rev. Rul. 72-271, 1972-1 C.B. 369.  Therefore, for purposes of\n7\nPLR-112101-02\n\u00a7 170(e)(5), Company 1 ADSs are stock for which market quotations are readily\navailable on an established securities market.\nThe Taxpayers represent that the Taxpayers have taken steps to ensure that the\nDonees will be able to sell the contributed ADSs in compliance with Rule 145.  The\nTaxpayers also represent that the aggregate contributions of the Donees will be limited\nsuch that the total number of Company 1 ADSs contributed by the Taxpayers to the\nDonees (including any ADSs already held by the Donees) will be substantially less than\n1% of the shares outstanding of Company 1 as shown by the most recent report or\nstatement published by Company 1.  The taxpayers also represent that contributions\nwill be made to the Donees only at such times when, to the best of their knowledge,\nthere will not be any proposed recapitalization, tender or exchange offer, stock\nrepurchase program or similar plan that would have the effect of substantially reducing\nthe number of outstanding shares of Company 1 within the 3-month period following the\ncontribution.  The Taxpayers represent that the Taxpayers will, prior to the proposed\ncontribution, provide a statement to the Donees that the requirements of Rule 145 are\nmet for all transfers of the Company 1 ADSs by the Taxpayers and that the Taxpayers\nwill not take any steps that will prevent the Donees from making transfers of Company 1\nADSs free of any Rule 145 resale restrictions.\nThe Taxpayers also represent that, under the Governance Agreement, the Family\nShareholders may contribute Company 1 ADSs to the Donees without restriction and\nthat such contributed Company 1 ADSs may be sold by the Donees without restriction.\nBased on the Taxpayers\u2019 representations, we conclude that the ADSs that the\nTaxpayers plan to contribute to the Donees constitute stock for which, for purposes of\n\u00a7 170(e)(5), market quotations are readily available on an established securities market.\nTo meet the requirements of \u00a7 170(e)(5)(B)(ii) of the Code, the shares must be capital\ngain property within the meaning of \u00a7 170(b)(1)(C)(iv), which means that the shares\nwould have to result in long-term capital gain if sold at their fair market value.  Under\n\u00a7 1222(3), long-term capital gain results from the sale of a capital asset held for more\nthan one year. The Taxpayers represent that, at the time of the contribution, the\ncontributed Company 1 ADSs (i) in the hands of each of Partnership and the Taxpayers\nwill be deemed, under \u00a7 1223(1) to have been held by each of Partnership and the\nTaxpayers for more than one year from the date such ADSs were acquired by each of\nthem and (ii) will not come within any of the exceptions set forth in subsections (1)\nthrough (5) of \u00a7 1221.  In addition, the Taxpayers anticipate that the fair market value of\nthe Company 1 ADSs on the contribution date will be more than the adjusted basis of\nthe ADSs.  Based upon the Taxpayers\u2019 representations, we conclude that the Company\n1 ADSs that will be contributed to the Donees represent long-term capital gain property\nwithin the meaning of \u00a7 170(b)(1)(C)(iv), and Taxpayers\u2019 contribution of the shares will\nmeet the requirements of \u00a7 170(e)(5)(B)(ii).\n8\nPLR-112101-02\nSince clauses (i) and (ii) of \u00a7 170(e)(5)(B) are met, and Taxpayers will not contribute\nmore than 10 percent (within the meaning of \u00a7 170(e)(5)(C)) of all outstanding stock of\nCompany 1 to the Donees, we conclude that the Company 1 ADSs that the Taxpayers\nplan to contribute to the Donees are qualified appreciated stock as defined in\n\u00a7 170(e)(5).\nCAVEATS:\nA copy of this letter must be attached to any income tax return to which it is relevant. \nWe enclose an extra copy of the letter for this purpose.

Additional information was received in letters dated April 1, \n2009, May 5, 2009, May 7, 2009, May 11, 2009, June 23, 2009, and June 26, 2009.  \nThe information provided in these letters is summarized below.\nThe rulings contained in this letter are based on facts and representations submitted by \nthe taxpayer and accompanied by a penalties of perjury statement executed by an \nappropriate party.  This office has not verified any of the material submitted in support of \nthe request for rulings.  Verification of the information, representations, and other data \nmay be required as part of the audit process. \nIn particular, this office has not reviewed any information pertaining to, and has made \nno determination regarding, whether the Distribution (described below):  (i) satisfies the \nbusiness purpose requirement of \u00a7 1.355-2(b) of the Income Tax Regulations, (ii) is \nused principally as a device for the distribution of the earnings and profits of the \ndistributing corporation, the controlled corporations, or both (see \u00a7 355(a)(1)(B) of the \nInternal Revenue Code and \u00a7 1.355-2(d)), or (iii) is part of a plan (or series of related \ntransactions) pursuant to which one or more persons will acquire directly or indirectly \nstock representing a 50-percent or greater interest in the distributing corporation or \neither of the controlled corporations (see \u00a7 355(e) and \u00a7 1.355-7).\nSummary of Facts \nDistributing is a closely held State X corporation incorporated on Date e.  Since Date f, \nDistributing has been taxed as a Subchapter S corporation.  Distributing is a cash \nmethod taxpayer that files its returns on a calendar year.   Distributing has one class of \nvoting common stock outstanding.  Shareholder c owns x% and Shareholder d owns y% \nof Distributing\u2019s outstanding stock.    \nDistributing is engaged in the rental real estate business consisting of operating and \nmanaging Apartment Building 1 and Apartment Building 2.  The financial information, \nsubmitted by Distributing, indicates that Apartment Building 1 and Apartment Building 2\neach has had gross receipts and operating expenses representing the active conduct of \nPLR-109509-09\n3\na trade or business for each of the past five years.\nDistributing\u2019s employees are actively engaged in the following regular business \nactivities:  advertising for tenants, speaking with potential tenants, showing properties to \npotential tenants, preparing leases for tenants, collecting rent, cleaning and maintaining \ncommon areas, receiving calls from tenants for repairs, paying bills, maintaining books, \npainting and cleaning apartment units for new tenants, and when necessary evicting \ntenants.  In addition to the above activities, Distributing\u2019s employees are periodically \nengaged in making major repairs, including renovations.  The work required for these \nmajor repairs is personally performed by Distributing\u2019s employees and also contracted \nfor by independent contractors.  Shareholder c and Shareholder d each perform both \noperational and managerial duties with respect to Apartment Building 1 and Apartment \nBuilding 2.\nSignificant disagreements had developed between Shareholder c and Shareholder d \nconcerning the operation of Distributing.  These disagreements have impaired \nDistributing\u2019s ability to function as a business and have resulted in Litigation in State X.  \nThis Litigation was resolved through the parties reaching a court approved settlement \nwhereby Distributing\u2019s assets would be divided between Shareholder c and Shareholder \nd.  To accomplish this settlement, the parties have structured the Proposed Transaction, \ndescribed below.  \nProposed Transaction\nFor what are represented to be valid business purposes, Distributing has proposed the \nfollowing transaction (the \u201cProposed Transaction\u201d):\n(i) Distributing will form Controlled A and Controlled B as State X corporations \n(collectively, the \u201cControlled corporations\u201d).  Each of the Controlled corporations will be \na cash-method taxpayer which will file its tax returns on a calendar year, and each will \nhave one class of voting common stock.  Each Controlled corporation upon formation \nwill elect to be taxed as a Subchapter S corporation. \n(ii) Distributing will transfer Apartment Building 1 and a de minimis amount of cash to \nControlled A in exchange for all of the Controlled A stock and the assumption by \nControlled A of liabilities related to that apartment building (\u201cContribution 1\u201d).  \n(iii) Distributing will transfer Apartment Building 2 and a de minimis amount of cash to \nControlled B in exchange for all of the Controlled B stock and the assumption by \nControlled B of liabilities related to that apartment building (\u201cContribution 2\u201d).  \nContribution 1 and Contribution 2 are sometimes collectively referred to as the \n\u201cContributions.\u201d\n(iv) Distributing will distribute all of the Controlled A stock to Shareholder c in exchange \nfor all of Shareholder c\u2019s Distributing stock, and it will distribute all of the Controlled B \nPLR-109509-09\n4\nstock to Shareholder d in exchange for all of Shareholder d\u2019s Distributing stock \n(together, the \u201cDistribution\u201d).  Thereafter, Shareholder c will own all of the Controlled A \nstock, and Shareholder d will own all of the Controlled B stock.\n(v) Distributing will liquidate.\nRepresentations\n(a) Distributing, Controlled A, Controlled B, and each of their respective shareholders \nwill pay their own expenses incurred in connection with the Proposed Transaction.\n(b) The indebtedness owed by Controlled A or Controlled B to Distributing after the \nDistribution, if any, will not constitute stock or securities.\n(c) The fair market value of the Controlled A stock received by Shareholder c will be \napproximately equal to the fair market value of the Distributing stock surrendered by \nShareholder c in the exchange, and the fair market value of the Controlled B stock \nreceived by Shareholder d will be approximately equal to the fair market value of the \nDistributing stock surrendered by Shareholder d in the exchange.\n(d) No part of the consideration to be distributed by Distributing will be received by a \nshareholder as a creditor, employee, or in any capacity other than that of a shareholder \nof the corporation.\n(e) No part of the consideration to be distributed by Distributing will be received by a \nsecurity holder as an employee or in any capacity other than that of a security holder of \nthe corporation. \n(f) The five years of financial information submitted on behalf of Distributing is \nrepresentative of its present operation, and with regard to such corporation, there have \nbeen no substantial operational changes since the date of the last financial statements \nsubmitted.\n(g) The five years of financial information submitted on behalf of Apartment Building 1 to \nbe transferred to Controlled A is representative of its present operation, and with regard \nto Apartment Building 1, there have been no substantial operational changes since the \ndate of the last financial statements submitted.\n(h) The five years of financial information submitted on behalf of Apartment Building 2 to \nbe transferred to Controlled B is representative of its present operation, and with regard \nto Apartment Building 2, there have been no substantial operational changes since the \ndate of the last financial statements submitted.  \n(i) Following the transaction, Controlled A and Controlled B will each continue, \nindependently and with its separate employees, the active conduct of its share of all the \nPLR-109509-09\n5\nintegrated activities of the business conducted by Distributing prior to consummation of \nthe transaction.  Distributing will be liquidated. \n(j) The distribution of the stock of Controlled A and Controlled B is carried out for the \nfollowing corporate business purposes:  (i) the facilitation of the settlement of the \nLitigation instituted by Shareholder c against Shareholder d and Distributing regarding \nthe operations of the business, and (ii) to avoid further disharmony in the operations of \nthe business.  The distribution of the stock of Controlled A and Controlled B is \nmotivated, in whole or substantial part, by one or more of these corporate business \npurposes.\n(k) The Distribution is not used principally as a device for the distribution of the earnings \nand profits of Distributing, Controlled A, Controlled B, or collectively.\n(l) The total fair market value of the assets Distributing will transfer to Controlled A in \nContribution 1 will exceed the sum of (i) the amount of any liabilities assumed (within \nthe meaning of \u00a7 357(d)) by Controlled A in connection with the exchange, (ii) the \namount of any liabilities owed to Controlled A by Distributing that are discharged or \nextinguished in connection with the exchange, and (iii) the amount of any cash and the \nfair market value of any other property (other than stock and securities permitted to be \nreceived under \u00a7 361(a) without the recognition of gain) received by Distributing from \nControlled A in connection with the exchange.  \n(m) The total fair market value of the assets Distributing will transfer to Controlled B in \nContribution 2 will exceed the sum of (i) the amount of any liabilities assumed (within \nthe meaning of \u00a7 357(d)) by Controlled B in connection with the exchange, (ii) the \namount of any liabilities owed to Controlled B by Distributing that are discharged or \nextinguished in connection with the exchange, and (iii) the amount of any cash and the \nfair market value of any other property (other than stock and securities permitted to be \nreceived under \u00a7 361(a) without the recognition of gain) received by Distributing from \nControlled B in connection with the exchange. \n(n) The liabilities to be assumed (within the meaning of \u00a7 357(d)) by Controlled A and \nControlled B in the Contribution, if any, and the liabilities to which the transferred assets \nare subject, if any, were incurred in the ordinary course of business and are associated \nwith the assets being transferred.\n(o) The aggregate fair market value of the assets Distributing transfers to each \nControlled corporation in the Contributions will equal or exceed the aggregate adjusted \nbasis of these assets.\n(p) The fair market value of the assets of each Controlled corporation will exceed the \namount of its liabilities immediately after the exchange.\nPLR-109509-09\n6\n(q) Distributing neither accumulated its receivables nor made extraordinary payment of \nits payables in anticipation of the transaction.\n(r) No intercorporate debt will exist between Distributing and either Controlled \ncorporation or between Controlled A and Controlled B at the time of, or subsequent to, \nthe distribution of the stock of Controlled A and Controlled B. \n(s) Payments made in connection with all continuing transactions, if any, between \nControlled A and Controlled B, will be for fair market value based on terms and \nconditions arrived at by the parties bargaining at arm's length.\n(t) No parties to the transaction are investment companies as defined in \n\u00a7 368(a)(2)(F)(iii) and (iv).  \n(u) For purposes of \u00a7 355(d), immediately after the Distribution, no person (determined \nafter applying \u00a7 355(d)(7)) will hold stock possessing 50-percent or more of the total \ncombined voting power of all classes of Distributing stock entitled to vote, or 50-percent \nor more of the total value of shares of all classes of Distributing stock, that was acquired \nby purchase (as defined in \u00a7 355(d)(5) and (8)) during the five-year period (determined \nafter applying \u00a7 355(d)(6)) ending on the date of the Distribution.\n(v) For purposes of \u00a7 355(d), immediately after the Distribution, no person (determined \nafter applying \u00a7 355(d)(7)) will hold stock possessing 50-percent or more of the total \ncombined voting power of all classes of either Controlled A or Controlled B stock \nentitled to vote, or 50-percent or more of the total value of shares of all classes of either \nControlled A or Controlled B stock, that was either (i) acquired by purchase (as defined \nin \u00a7 355(d)(5) and (8)) during the five-year period (determined after applying \n\u00a7 355(d)(6)) ending on the date of the Distribution or (ii) attributable to distributions on \nDistributing stock or securities that were acquired by purchase (as defined in \n\u00a7 355(d)(5) and (8)) during the five-year period (determined after applying \u00a7 355(d)(6)) \nending on the date of the Distribution.  \n(w) The Distribution is not part of a plan or series of related transactions (within the \nmeaning of \u00a7 1.355-7) pursuant to which one or more persons will acquire directly or \nindirectly stock representing a 50-percent or greater interest (within the meaning of \n\u00a7 355(d)(4)) in Distributing, Controlled A, or Controlled B (including any predecessor or \nsuccessor of any such corporation).\n(x) Immediately after the Distribution, neither Distributing, Controlled A, nor Controlled B \nwill be a disqualified investment corporation (within the meaning of \u00a7 355(g)(2)).\nRulings\nPLR-109509-09\n7\n(1) Contribution 1 and Contribution 2, together, followed by the Distribution, will qualify \nas a reorganization within the meaning of \u00a7 368(a)(1)(D).  Distributing, Controlled A, and \nControlled B will each be \u201ca party to a reorganization\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 368(b).  \n(2) No gain or loss will be recognized by Distributing on the Contributions (\u00a7\u00a7 361(a) \nand 357(b)) with the exception that gain will be recognized by Distributing on the \nContributions to the extent that the liabilities to be assumed by Controlled A and \nControlled B, respectively, (plus the liabilities to which the transferred assets are \nsubject) exceed Distributing's adjusted basis in the assets transferred to Controlled A \nand Controlled B, respectively (\u00a7 357(c)).  \n(3) No gain or loss will be recognized by Controlled A or Controlled B on the \nContributions (\u00a7 1032(a)).\n(4) The basis of each asset received by Controlled A and Controlled B in the \nContributions will equal the basis of that asset in the hands of Distributing immediately \nbefore the Contributions, increased by the amount of gain recognized by Distributing on \nthe Contributions under ruling (2) above (\u00a7 362(b)).\n(5) The holding period of each asset received by Controlled A and Controlled B in the \nContributions will include the period during which Distributing held that asset \n(\u00a7 1223(2)).\n(6) No gain or loss will be recognized by Distributing on the Distribution (\u00a7 361(c)(1)).\n(7) No gain or loss will be recognized by (and no amount will be included in the income \nof) Shareholder c or Shareholder d on the Distribution (\u00a7 355(a)(1)).\n(8) The aggregate basis of the Controlled A stock in the hands of Shareholder c \nimmediately after the Distribution will equal Shareholder c's aggregate basis in the \nDistributing stock surrendered in the Distribution (\u00a7 358(a)(1)). \n(9) The aggregate basis of the Controlled B stock in the hands of Shareholder d \nimmediately after the Distribution will equal Shareholder d's aggregate basis in the \nDistributing stock surrendered in the Distribution (\u00a7 358(a)(1)).  \n(10) The holding period of the Controlled A stock received by Shareholder c will include \nthe holding period of the Distributing stock surrendered by the shareholder in exchange \ntherefore, provided such stock is held as a capital asset on the date of the Distribution \n(\u00a7 1223(1)).\n(11) The holding period of the Controlled B stock received by Shareholder d will include \nthe holding period of the Distributing stock surrendered by the shareholder in exchange \ntherefore, provided such stock is held as a capital asset on the date of the Distribution \n(\u00a7 1223(1)).\nPLR-109509-09\n8\n(12) Proper allocation of earnings and profits between Distributing, Controlled A, and \nControlled B will be made in accordance with \u00a7 312(h) and \u00a7 1.312-10(a).  No allocation \nshall be made of any deficit of Distributing\u2019s earnings and profits to Controlled A or to \nControlled B.  \n(13) Distributing\u2019s momentary ownership of the stock of Controlled A and Controlled B, \nas part of the reorganization under \u00a7 368(a)(1)(D), will not cause Controlled A or \nControlled B to have an ineligible shareholder for any portion of its first taxable year \nunder \u00a7 1361(b)(2)(B) (Rev. Rul. 72-320, 1972-1 C.B. 270).\nCaveats\nNo opinion is expressed about the tax treatment of the Proposed Transaction under \nother provisions of the Code or regulations or the tax treatment of any condition existing \nat the time of, or effects resulting from, the Proposed Transaction that is not specifically \ncovered by the above rulings.  In particular, no opinion is expressed regarding:  (i) \nwhether the Distribution satisfies the business purpose requirement of \u00a7 1.355-2(b), (ii) \nwhether the Distribution is used principally as a device for the distribution of the \nearnings and profits of Distributing or the Controlled corporations or both \n(see \u00a7 355(a)(1)(B) and \u00a7 1.355-2(d)), or (iii) whether the Distribution is part of a plan (or \nseries of related transactions) pursuant to which one or more persons will acquire \ndirectly or indirectly stock representing a 50-percent or greater interest in Distributing or \neither of the Controlled corporations (see \u00a7 355(e) and \u00a7 1.355-7).  \nProcedural Matters\nThis ruling is directed only to the taxpayer who requested it.

The information submitted in that\nrequest and in later correspondence is summarized below. \nSummary of Facts\nParent is the publicly held parent of a consolidated group.  Distributing is a\nwholly owned subsidiary of Parent  that conducts Business A, Business B, and\nBusiness C, all of which are located within Industry AB.   Parent also owns all of the\noutstanding Sub 1 stock.\n            \nWe have received financial information indicating that each of Business A and\nBusiness C, as operated by Distributing, has had gross receipts and operating\nexpenses representing the active conduct of a trade or business for each of the past\nfive years. \n                     \nDistributing is subject to regulation by Government Agency.  Government Agency\nhas promulgated new rules relating to Industry AB by enacting the Rules.  Under the\nRules, Business A will remain regulated, but Business B and Business C will be open to\ncompetition.  The Rules require that all competitive businesses operated by Distributing\nbe separated from its noncompetitive businesses.   The Rules do not permit such a\nseparation to be made by a transfer to a Distributing subsidiary.  \nDistributing and Government Agency have executed Agreement E, which\nprovides that Distributing will separate its regulated businesses from its unregulated\nbusinesses.  Agreement E specifically requires Distributing to transfer its Business B\nand Business C assets to respective direct subsidiaries of Parent by Date 1. \nDistributing proposes to divest itself of both Business B and Business C.  The\ndistribution of Business B was the subject of a private letter ruling issued by this office\non Date 2, as modified by a supplemental ruling issued on Date 3.        \nProposed Transaction\nTo effect the separation of Business C, Distributing has proposed the following\nseries of steps (collectively, the \u201cProposed Transaction\u201d):\n(i) Distributing will transfer its Business C assets to newly formed Controlled in\nexchange for al of Controlled\u2019s stock and the assumption by Controlled of the liabilities\nPLR-130646-02\n3\nassociated with the Business C assets (the \u201cContribution\u201d).\n(ii)   Distributing will distribute all of the stock of Controlled to Parent (the\n\u201cDistribution\u201d).\n(iii) Controlled will merge with and into Sub 1 (the \u201cMerger\u201d).\nDistributing intends, as part of the proposed transaction, to enter into a purchase\nagreement with Parent whereby Distributing will purchase x from Parent (\u201cAgreement\n1\").  In addition, Parent and Sub 1 will enter into a purchase agreement whereby Parent\nwill purchase x from Sub 1 for the purpose of fulfilling a part of the Agreement 1\nobligation (\u201cAgreement 2\"). \n \nRepresentations\nThe taxpayer has submitted the following representations in connection with the\nproposed transaction:\n(a)  No part of the consideration to be distributed by Distributing will be received\nby Parent as a creditor, employee, or in any other capacity other than that of a\nDistributing shareholder.\n(b)  The five years of financial information submitted on behalf of Distributing  \nrepresents the corporation\u2019s present operations, and with regard to such corporation,\nthere have been no substantial operational changes since the date of the last financial\nstatements submitted.\n(c)  The five years of financial information submitted on behalf of Controlled  \nrepresents the corporation\u2019s present operations, and with regard to such corporation,\nthere have been no substantial operational changes since the date of the last financial\nstatements submitted.\n(d)  Following the transaction, Distributing and Controlled (or its successor), will\neach continue the active conduct of its business, independently and with its separate\nemployees, except that during a period of transition Distributing and Controlled may\nshare the services of certain employees to the extent some Business C assets are\nrelocated to Sub 1 before all assets are so relocated.  Once all Business C assets have\nbeen transferred to Sub 1, it is contemplated there will be no shared employees. \n(e)  The Distribution is motivated, in whole or substantial part, by the corporate\nbusiness purpose of separating its regulated and unregulated businesses as required\nby the Rules.\n(f) Except for the Merger, there is no plan or intention by Parent to sell,\nPLR-130646-02\n4\nexchange, transfer by gift, or otherwise dispose of any stock in either Distributing or\nControlled (or its successor) after the transaction. \n(g)  There is no plan or intention by either Distributing or Controlled (or its\nsuccessor), directly or through any subsidiary corporation, to purchase any of its\noutstanding stock after the transaction, other than through stock purchases meeting the\nrequirements of \u00a7 4.05(1)(b) of Rev. Proc. 96-30, 1996-1 C.B. 696, 705.\n(h) Except for the Merger, there is no plan or intention to liquidate either\nDistributing or Controlled, to merge either corporation with any other corporation, or to\nsell or otherwise dispose of the assets of either corporation after the transaction, except\nin the ordinary course of business.\n(i)  The total fair market value of the assets transferred to Controlled by\nDistributing will equal or exceed the amount of the liabilities assumed (as determined\nunder \u00a7 357(d) of the Internal Revenue Code) by Controlled.\n(j)  The liabilities assumed (as determined under \u00a7 357(d)) in the transaction\nwere incurred in the ordinary course of business and are associated with the assets\nbeing transferred. \n(k)   No intercorporate debt will exist between Distributing and Controlled at the\ntime of, or after, the Distribution.\n(l)  Immediately before the Distribution, items of income, gain, loss, deduction,\nand credit will be taken into account as required by the applicable intercompany\ntransaction regulations (see Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.1502-13 and \u00a7 1.1502-14 as in effect\nbefore the publication of T.D. 8597, 1995-2 C.B. 147, and as currently in effect; Treas.\nReg. \u00a7 1.1502-13 as published by T.D. 8597).\n(m) Payments made in connection with all continuing transactions between\nDistributing and Controlled (or its successor), will be for fair market value based on\nterms and conditions arrived at by the parties bargaining at arm\u2019s length.\n(n)  No two parties to the transaction are investment companies as defined in \n\u00a7 368(a)(2)(F)(iii) and (iv).\n(o)  The Distribution is not part of a plan or series of related transactions (within\nthe meaning of \u00a7 355(e)) pursuant to which one or more persons will acquire, directly or\nindirectly, stock possessing 50 percent or more of the total combined voting power of all\nclasses of either Distributing stock or Controlled stock entitled to vote, or 50 percent or\nmore of the total value of shares of all classes of either Distributing or Controlled stock.\n(p)   The Merger will qualify for nonrecognition treatment pursuant to                  \nPLR-130646-02\n5\n\u00a7 368(a)(1)(A).\nRulings\nBased solely on the information submitted and the representations set forth\nabove, we rule as follows:\n(1)  The Contribution, followed by the Distribution, will be a reorganization within\nthe meaning of \u00a7 368(a)(1)(D).

You have requested a ruling that X\u2019s payment of a lump sum of \nmoney to Y in exchange for Y\u2019s community property interest in a nonqualified deferred \ncompensation plan payable to X by Company will constitute nontaxable transfers \nbetween former spouses that are related to the cessation of their marriage under \nsection 1041 of the Internal Revenue Code, and that the \u201cassignment of income \ndoctrine\u201d will not cause Y to be taxed when X receives payment of that deferred \ncompensation from Company.  You have also requested a ruling that the exchange is a \ntransfer \u201cfor full and adequate consideration in money or money\u2019s worth\u201d under \u00a7 2516 \nof the Code that will not result in a taxable gift by either X or Y to the other. \n \nAccording to the facts submitted, X and Y were married on Date 1.  On Date 2, several \nyears after their marriage, X secured employment with Company.  X remains employed \nby Company.  On Date 3, X and Y were separated.  On Date 4, X and Y entered into a \nMarital Settlement Agreement (MSA).  X and Y were divorced pursuant to a Judgment \nof Dissolution entered by the Superior Court for County, State A, on Date 5.  The MSA \nwas incorporated into the Date 5 Judgment. \n \nIt is represented that X\u2019s earnings from personal services for Company during the last w \nyears of X and Y\u2019s x -year marriage constitute community property under the laws of \nState A, and that X\u2019s earnings from personal services for Company during the w years \nsince Date 3, the date of separation, constitute X\u2019s separate property (or community \nproperty with Husband\u2019s current wife).  X intends to retire on Date 10 at y years of age.   \n \nDuring their marriage, X\u2019s compensation for services to Company in which Y has a \ncommunity property interest includes deferred compensation under Company\u2019s \nSupplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP), a non-qualified employee benefit \nplan.  Under the terms of the SERP, if X retires after age 55 but before age 65 with \nmore than 10 years of service, X will receive a benefit that is reduced by a certain \npercentage for each month that X\u2019s retirement date precedes X\u2019s 65th birthday.   \n \nThe SERP Trust Agreement (Trust) describes the terms of the benefits under the \nSERP.   Section 3.3 provides that a participant may not voluntarily or involuntarily, \nassign, anticipate, alienate, commute, pledge or encumber any benefits to which he is \nor may become entitled to under the SERP nor may the same be subject to attachment \nor garnishment by any creditor of a Participant.  Section 9.2 provides that the interests \nof a Participant (or beneficiary) in the trust estate shall be no greater than the interest of \nany general unsecured creditor of Company.  No right or interest of any Participant (or \nbeneficiary) in the trust estate shall be transferable or assignable or subject to \nalienation, anticipation, encumbrance, garnishment, attachment or execution.  Section \n9.3 provides that nothing in the trust instrument is to be construed to relieve Company \nof its obligation to pay the Retirement Benefit of any Participant except to the extent that \nthe obligation is satisfied by actual payment from the trust estate.  \n \n \nPLR-104891-04 \n \n3 \nUnder the terms of the above MSA, Article II, Section 1, X will transfer, assign and \nconvey to Y, as Y\u2019s sole and separate property, all right, title and interest in and to those \nitems of community property more fully described in Schedule A, attached to the MSA. \nSchedule A, Item 9 conveys to Y one-half of the community interest in the Pension Plan \nand the Company SERP held for the benefit of X through X\u2019s employment with \nCompany as set forth in a Domestic Relations Order that is to be prepared and \nsubmitted to the plan for approval as a Qualified Domestic Relations Order. \n \nOn Date 6 the Superior Court issued a \u201cStipulation and Order for Division of the \nCompany SERP\u201d (Stipulation).  The Stipulation awarded Y one-half of the community \nproperty interest in X\u2019s Company SERP.  The Stipulation provides that the community \nproperty interest in the SERP is to be a pro rata portion of each payment, if any, (after \nreduction for payments to be made under any qualified plan as provided in the Plan) as \neach payment is received.  Community property is to be determined by a fraction, the \nnumerator of which is the number of months of credited service from the date of \nemployment (Date 2) until the date of separation (Date 3).  The denominator is the total \nnumber of months of credited service from date of employment to date of retirement or \nother termination of X\u2019s employment. \n \nThe Stipulation also provides that X will receive all SERP payments from Company or \nTrust and that within 10 days of receipt of such payment, X will pay Y\u2019s share to Y, \nwithout reduction for taxes.  Y is to include Y\u2019s share of the SERP payments in Y\u2019s \nincome for Federal income tax purposes and indemnify and hold X harmless from all \ntaxes attributable to Y\u2019s share of the SERP. \n \nSeveral years after the Superior Court issued Stipulation, X reached the age of eligibility \nfor retirement but had not yet retired from Company.  Therefore, no amounts were yet \npayable under the SERP.  Y wanted to commence receiving Y\u2019s share of the benefits \nunder the SERP, but because X had not yet retired, no amounts were yet payable under \nthe SERP.  On Date 7 Y filed a motion seeking an order from the Superior Court to \nrequire X to buy out Y\u2019s interest in the SERP.   On Date 8, X delivered to Y\u2019s counsel a \nResponsive Declaration in opposition to the motion.  Y argued, inter alia, citing certain \ncourt cases, that because the commencement of benefits under the SERP was delayed \nby X\u2019s unilateral decision (for the benefit of his separate estate) not to retire, X should \nbe compelled either to commence paying Y\u2019s share of the SERP benefits from X\u2019s own \nfunds or X should be required to buy out Y\u2019s interest in the SERP in a lump sum or in \ninterest-bearing installments.  \n \nAfter a lengthy period of negotiations, X and Y entered into, and the Superior Court \napproved, a Stipulation and Order Re Division of the SERP Benefits (Final Stipulation) \non Date 9.   Under the terms of the Final Stipulation, X will pay Y $z together with the \ntax-exempt earnings on the investment of $z in full satisfaction of all of Y\u2019s claims with \nrespect to the SERP.  Paragraph 3 of the Final Stipulation provides that the parties \nintend that neither party will have a gift or income tax consequence from the transfer of \n \nPLR-104891-04 \n \n4 \nthe $z amount.  The payment is intended to be nontaxable to Y and nondeductible by X \nunder section 71(b)(1)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code. \n \nPursuant to the Final Stipulation, X has paid the $z amount into a trust fund held by X\u2019s \nattorney.  Those funds have been invested in a tax-exempt investment as agreed upon \nby the parties.  It has been represented that this amount acts as security for the \nperformance of X\u2019s obligations under the Final Stipulation.  If, but only if, a satisfactory \nprivate letter ruling is received from the Internal Revenue Service, must the attorney \ntransfer the funds to Y.  Accordingly, it has further been represented that X has not, and \nwill not, surrender dominion and control over the funds until a ruling satisfactory to X \nand Y is received from the Service.  Y has therefore received no economic benefit from \nthe $z amount in trust, nor is Y in constructive receipt of such money.  X expressly \nrepresents that X will continue to be treated as the owner of $z amount while it is held in \ntrust by the attorney, and X will include in X\u2019s income for Federal income tax purposes \nany nontax-exempt income earned on such amounts while held in trust by X\u2019s attorney. \n \nX also represents that X will be taxable for Federal income tax purposes on the full \namount of SERP deferred compensation payments made by Company.   \n \nRuling Request No. 1 \n \nYou have requested a ruling that both the transfer by X to Y (through X\u2019s attorney\u2019s trust \naccount) of the $z amount (including the earnings held in trust by X\u2019s attorney) and Y\u2019s \ntransfer to X of Y\u2019s interest in the SERP constitute transfers between former spouses \nthat are \u201cincident to divorce\u201d within the meaning of section 1041(a) of the Code because \nthey are related to the cessation of their marriage within the meaning of section \n1041(c)(2).  You have requested a further ruling that the assignment of income doctrine \nwill not apply to these transfers with the result that neither X nor Y will be required to \ninclude any amount in gross income with respect to these transfers. \n \nSection 1041(a) provides that no gain or loss shall be recognized on a transfer of \nproperty from an individual to (or in trust for the benefit of) (1) a spouse, or (2) a former \nspouse, but only if the transfer is incident to the divorce.  Section 1041(c) provides that \nfor purposes of \u00a71041(a)(2), a transfer of property is incident to the divorce if the \ntransfer occurs (1) within one year after the date on which the marriage ceases, or (2) is \nrelated to the cessation of the marriage. \n \nSection 1.1041-1T(b), Q&A-7 of the Temporary Income Tax Regulations addresses \nwhen a transfer of property is \"related to the cessation of the marriage.\"  Q&A-7 \nprovides that a transfer of property is treated as related to the cessation of the marriage \nif the transfer is pursuant to a divorce or separation instrument, as defined in \u00a7 71(b)(2), \nand the transfer occurs not more than 6 years after the date on which the marriage \nceases.  A divorce or separation instrument includes a modification or amendment to \nsuch decree or instrument.  Any transfer not pursuant to a divorce or separation \ninstrument and any transfer occurring more than 6 years after the cessation of the \n \nPLR-104891-04 \n \n5 \nmarriage is presumed to be not related to the cessation of the marriage.  This \npresumption may be rebutted only by showing that the transfer was made to effect the \ndivision of property owned by the former spouses at the time of the cessation of the \nmarriage.  For example, the presumption may be rebutted by showing that (a) the \ntransfer was not made within the one-and six-year periods described above because of \nfactors which hampered an earlier transfer of the property, such as legal or business \nimpediments to transfer or disputes concerning the value of the property owned at the \ntime of the cessation of the marriage, and (b) the transfer is effected promptly after the \nimpediment to transfer is removed. \n \nIn this case, on Date 4, X and Y entered into an MSA that provided for the division of \nthe community estate\u2019s interest in X\u2019s SERP.  X and Y were divorced pursuant to a \nJudgment of Dissolution entered by the Superior Court for County, State A, on Date 5.  \nThe MSA was incorporated into that Judgment of Dissolution.  On Date 9,  X and Y \nentered into and the Superior Court approved the Stipulation and Order Re Division of \nthe SERP (Final Stipulation).  The Final Stipulation provides that X will pay Y $z \ntogether with the tax-exempt earnings on the investment of $z in full satisfaction of all of \nY\u2019s claims with respect to the SERP.   \n \nThe transfers contemplated under the Final Stipulation are governed by \u00a7 1041 of the \nCode and the regulations thereunder.  Q&A-7 of \u00a7 1.1041-1T(b) specifically discusses \nwhen a transfer of property is related to the cessation of the marriage for purposes of \ntransfers under instruments executed after enactment of \u00a7 1041.  In this case, any \ntransfer of property under the Final Stipulation will clearly occur outside the six-year rule \nset forth in that regulation.   Nevertheless,  Q&A-7 specifically recognizes that a divorce \nor separation instrument includes a modification or amendment to such decree or \ninstrument.  Consequently, any order from the divorce court that specifically modifies an \noriginal divorce or separation instrument must be considered related to the cessation of \nthe marriage, even if such order occurs years after the divorce.  See, e.g., Young v. \nCommissioner, 113 T.C. 152 (1999), aff\u2019d, 240 F.3d 369 (4th Cir. 2001) (Tax Court held \nthat the purpose of a 1992 Agreement was to resolve a dispute between former \nspouses concerning the terms of their 1989 Property Settlement, and therefore the 1992 \nAgreement was incident to their divorce decree, notwithstanding that it modified a prior \nagreement and was executed years after the divorce decree.) \n \nIn this case, the parties have received an order issued by the Superior Court essentially \namending their original divorce instrument to incorporate the terms and provisions of the \nFinal Stipulation with respect to the division of the SERP.  Pursuant to Q&A-7, we \nconclude that, based on the representations set forth in the submission and the Final \nStipulation issued by the Superior Court, the following transfers are related to the \n\u201ccessation of the marriage\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 1041(c)(2) of the Code and are \ntherefore considered \u201cincident to divorce\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 1041(a): the transfer by X to \nY (through X\u2019s attorney\u2019s trust account) of the $z amount (including the earnings held in \ntrust by X\u2019s attorney), and Y\u2019s transfer to X of Y\u2019s interest in the SERP.  Accordingly, \npursuant to \u00a7 1041(a), no gain or loss will be recognized on these transfers by X or Y. \n \nPLR-104891-04 \n \n6 \n \nWith respect to the assignment of income component of this ruling request, we note that \nthe payment of the $z amount to Y from X is controlled by Balding v. Commissioner, 98 \nT.C. 368 (1992).  That case addressed the question of whether payments received by a \nspouse in settlement of her claim to a community property share of her ex-husband's \nmilitary retirement pay are includible in her income.  In Balding, petitioner and her \nhusband resided in California, a community property state, during their 19-year \nmarriage.  They were divorced in 1981, after ex-husband retired from the military. The \ndivorce court ordered a division of their community property and affirmed that the ex-\nhusband\u2019s military retirement pay was his sole and separate property.  In 1984, because \nof changes in California's community property law, petitioner asked the divorce court to \nreopen its judgment of divorce and award her a community property share of the military \nretirement pay.  Before the divorce court could act, petitioner and her ex-husband \nreached a settlement with regard to the military retirement pay. Petitioner relinquished \nany claim to ex-husband's military retirement pay in consideration of his promise to pay \nto her $ 15,000, $ 14,000, and $ 13,000 in 1986, 1987, and 1988, respectively.  The Tax \nCourt held that, under \u00a7 1041 of the Code, no income was recognized to petitioner on \naccount of receipt of the settlement payments. \n \nWith respect to the present case, Balding is consistent with the above determination \nthat under \u00a71041(a), Y is not taxable on the $z to be received from X.  Balding, \nhowever, focused on the amounts paid for the transfer of petitioner's interest in certain \nretirement benefits, not on which party is taxable when the retirement benefit payments \nare made.  The court stated: \"Accordingly, we have no occasion to consider whether the \nassignment of income doctrine would require petitioner's share of those retirement \npayments to be taken into petitioner's income as paid by the Government to Balding, \nnotwithstanding petitioner's lack of entitlement to such payments.\"  Balding at 373, n. 8. \n \nIn Rev. Rul. 2002-22, 2002-1 C.B. 849, the Service rejected applying the assignment of \nincome doctrine to certain transfers of property incident to divorce.  In that revenue \nruling, a taxpayer transferred nonstatutory stock options and nonqualified deferred \ncompensation rights to the taxpayer\u2019s former spouse incident to their divorce.  The \nruling first notes that Congress indicated that \u00a7 1041 of the Code should apply broadly \nto transfers of many types of property, including those that involve a right to receive \nordinary income that has accrued in an economic sense (such as interests in trusts and \nannuities).  Accordingly, and consistent with Balding, the ruling provides that stock \noptions and unfunded deferred compensation rights may constitute property within the \nmeaning of \u00a7 1041.  Rev. Rul. 2002-22 then notes that the courts and the Service have \nlong recognized that the assignment of income doctrine does not apply to transfers of \nincome rights between divorcing spouses because such transfers are not voluntary \nassignments within the scope of the assignment of income doctrine.  See Meisner v. \nUnited States, 133 F.3d 654 (8th Cir. 1998); Kenfield v. United States, 783 F.2d 966 \n(10th Cir. 1986); Schulze v. Commissioner, T.C.M. 1983-263; Cofield v. Koehler, 207 F. \nSupp. 73 (D. Kan. 1962). \n \n \nPLR-104891-04 \n \n7 \nRev. Rul. 2002-22 concludes that a taxpayer who transfers interests in nonstatutory \nstock options and nonqualified deferred compensation to the taxpayer's former spouse \nincident to divorce is not required to include an amount in gross income upon the \ntransfer.  Rev. Rul. 2002-22 further concludes that the former spouse, and not the \ntaxpayer, is required to include an amount in gross income when the former spouse \nexercises the stock options or when the deferred compensation is paid or made \navailable to the former spouse.  (We note that this revenue ruling expressly does not \napply to transfers of nonstatutory stock options, unfunded deferred compensation rights, \nor other future income rights to the extent such options or rights are unvested at the \ntime of transfer or to the extent that the transferor's rights to such income are subject to \nsubstantial contingencies at the time of the transfer.) \n \nPursuant to Rev. Rul. 2002-22 and Balding, we conclude that the assignment of income \ndoctrine does not apply to the transfer by X to Y (through X\u2019s attorney\u2019s trust account) of \nthe $z amount (including the earnings held in trust by X\u2019s attorney), and Y\u2019s transfer to X \nof Y\u2019s interest in the SERP with the result that neither X nor Y will be required to include \nany amount in gross income with respect to these transfers.  Therefore, the assignment \nof income doctrine will not cause Y to be taxable on any part of the SERP deferred \ncompensation payments received by X from Company. \n \nAs stated above, X has represented that X will be taxable for Federal income tax \npurposes on the full amount of SERP deferred compensation payments made by \nCompany.   \n  \nRuling Request No. 2 \n \nYou have also requested a ruling that the above exchange is a transfer \u201cfor full and \nadequate consideration in money or money\u2019s worth\u201d under \u00a7 2516 of the Code that will \nnot result in a taxable gift by either X or Y to the other. \n  \nSection 2501(a) of the Internal Revenue Code imposes a gift tax for each calendar year \non the transfer of property by gift during the calendar year. \n \nSection 2511 of the Internal Revenue Code provides that the gift tax shall apply whether \nthe transfer is in trust or otherwise, whether the gift is direct or indirect, and whether the \nproperty is real or personal, tangible or intangible. \n \nSection 2512(b) provides that where property is transferred for less than an adequate \nand full consideration in money or money\u2019s worth, the amount by which the value of the \nproperty exceeded the value of the consideration shall be deemed a gift. \n \nSection 2516 provides that where a husband and wife enter into a written agreement \nrelative to their marital and property rights and divorce occurs within the 3-year period \nbeginning on the date 1-year before such agreement is entered into (whether or not \nsuch agreement is approved by the divorce decree), any transfers of property interests \n \nPLR-104891-04 \n \n8 \nin property made pursuant to such agreement (1) to either spouse in settlement of his or \nher marital or property rights, or (2) to provide a reasonable allowance for the support of \nissue of the marriage during minority, shall be deemed to be transfers made for a full \nand adequate consideration in money or money\u2019s worth. \n \nSection 25.2516-1 of the Gift Tax Regulations provides that transfers of property or \ninterests in property made under the terms of a written agreement between spouses in \nsettlement of their marital or property rights are deemed to be for an adequate and full \nconsideration in money or money\u2019s worth and, therefore, exempt from the gift tax \n(whether or not the agreement is approved by a divorce decree), if the spouses obtain a \nfinal decree of divorce from each other within two years after entering the agreement. \n                                                                                                                                                   \nOn Date 3, X and Y were separated.  On Date 4, X and Y entered into an MSA that \nprovided for the division of the community estate\u2019s interest in X\u2019s SERP.  X and Y were \ndivorced pursuant to a Judgment of Dissolution entered by the Superior Court for \nCounty, State A, on Date 5.  The MSA was incorporated into the Judgment.  On Date 9 \nX and Y entered into and the Superior Court approved the Final Stipulation and Order \nRe Division of the SERP.  The Final Stipulation provides that X will pay Y $z together \nwith the tax-exempt earnings on the investment of $z in full satisfaction of all of Y\u2019s \nclaims with respect to the SERP.   \n \nThe transfer of $z by X to Y is made pursuant to the Judgment of Dissolution.  The \ntransfer is in full satisfaction of Y\u2019s interest in the SERP.  Accordingly, based on the \nfacts submitted and representations made, we conclude that, to the extent of Y\u2019s \ninterest in the SERP, the transfer of $z will be made for full and adequate consideration \nunder \u00a7 2516 and therefore the exchange will not result in a taxable gift by X or Y to the \nother. \n \nThe rulings contained in this letter are based upon information and representations \nsubmitted by the taxpayers and accompanied by penalty of perjury statements executed \nby the appropriate parties.

Your letter contends that there should be no reporting obligation \nbecause the discharge was not the result of an \u201cidentifiable event\u201d listed in Treasury \nRegulation 1.6050P-1(b)(2), but rather was required by the operation of state law. For \nthe reasons set forth below, we conclude that Entity is required to file Forms 1099-C \n \nPLR-116307-22 \n \n2 \nwith respect to the write-off of balances and charges pursuant to its settlement \nagreement because the discharge was the result of an identifiable event. \n \nFacts \n \nEntity is a credit union organized in State X. When certain debtors defaulted on loans, \nEntity sent presale notices to the debtors stating that the collateral for the loans was \nbeing repossessed.  Two of these debtors filed a class-action lawsuit in State X circuit \ncourt. In the lawsuit, the debtors alleged that defects in the presale notices Entity sent \nviolated State X Law for failing to clearly state whether a borrower would owe the \ndeficiency balance. After the filing of an amended petition, the parties engaged in \ndiscovery. The debtors filed a motion for class certification on Date 1. After the motion \nwas briefed and argued by the parties, the court certified the class on Date 2. \nSubsequently, the parties agreed to a settlement. The settlement agreement was \nexecuted Date 3. The joint motion for preliminary approval was entered that same day. \nAfter a fairness hearing, the court granted final approval of the settlement on Date 4.  \n \nLaw and Analysis \n \nSection 6050P of the Internal Revenue Code requires that any discharge of debt greater \nthan $600 must be reported to the IRS by the applicable entity. It is not disputed that \nEntity is an applicable entity. The report under section 6050P must include the name, \naddress, and Taxpayer Identification Number of the person whose debt is discharged, \namong other details. Under the regulations pertaining to section 6050P, however, the \nreport of the discharge is only required when one of the \u201cidentifiable events\u201d outlined in \nTreasury Regulation section 1.6050P-1(b)(2) takes place. \n \nThe identifiable event of primary relevance here is found in section 1.6050P-1(b)(2)(F). \nWhen an applicable financial entity and a debtor agree to discharge indebtedness for \nless than full consideration, this constitutes an identifiable event, and the discharge \nmust be reported.  To establish consideration, there must be a performance or a return \npromised which has been bargained for by the parties. Restatement (Second) Contracts \n\u00a7 71(1) (1981). In this case, Entity and the debtor class members agreed to the entry of \na judgment, approved and supervised by the court, which incorporates the parties' \nsettlement agreement by which Entity agreed to write off debt balances as part of the \noverall settlement of the pending litigation. This is an identifiable event described in \nsection 1.6050P-1(b)(2)(F). \n \nEntity\u2019s request for a ruling contends that the settlement agreement does not reflect a \nmere agreement of the parties, or any other identifiable event, but rather is a recognition \nthat the write-off of the deficiency balances was required under state law. \n \nWhile the application of State X Law regarding the sufficiency of the presale notices \nmay have been a factor in the parties' decision to settle the litigation, such \nconsiderations are typical of parties' assessment of litigation hazards in arriving at a \n \nPLR-116307-22 \n \n3 \nnegotiated settlement. The Agreement states that \u201c[Entity] disputes the claims but \ndesires to settle the claims being asserted against it on the terms and conditions in this \nAgreement to avoid the burden, expense, and uncertainty of continuing litigation.\u201d The \nfact that the terms of the settlement agreement were approved and incorporated into the \ncourt's Preliminary Order and Final Order does not serve to convert the discharge of the \ndebt from being entered into voluntarily to one forced by operation of state law.  \n \nEntity also argues that there was no identifiable event because the court in its Final \nOrder stated that the court had made an independent judicial investigation into the legal \nsufficiency of the presale notices and held that the presale notices are unenforceable. \nBut Entity vigorously pursued the litigation, including contesting class certification, \nthroughout the pendency of the case. It was only by entering into a settlement \nagreement with the class members that Entity gave up its disputed claims to deficiency \namounts. It was as part of this settlement agreement that the parties agreed to seek a \njudicial determination into a matter that they had already resolved, a determination \nmade not as a result of the adversarial litigation process, but by mutual request of the \nparties as part of the settlement agreement. The debt write-off is due to the settlement \nagreement, not the court\u2019s subsequent order.  \n \nConclusion \n \nBased solely on the information provided and the representations made, Entity is \nrequired to file Forms 1099-C with respect to the write-off of balances and charges \npursuant to its settlement agreement because the discharge was the result of an \nidentifiable event listed in section 1.6050P-1(b)(2). \n \nExcept as expressly provided herein, no opinion is expressed or implied concerning the \ntax consequences of any aspect of any transaction or item discussed or referenced in \nthis letter. \n \nThis ruling is directed only to the taxpayer requesting it.

On Date \n1, Decedent A named Trust T as the beneficiary of IRA X.  Trust T is valid under the laws \nof State S and became irrevocable upon Decedent A\u2019s spouse\u2019s death.  On Date 2, \nDecedent A exercised a power of appointment over Trust T naming each of Decedent A\u2019s \nchildren as trustees and beneficiaries of Trust T.  Decedent A died on Date 3.  Upon \nDecedent A\u2019s death, IRA X became an inherited IRA for the benefit of Trust T. \n \n \nPLR-125312-20 \n \n2 \nYou represent that in Year 1, within months after Decedent A\u2019s death, the custodian of \nIRA X advised Trust T\u2019s trustees that they could not trade stocks in IRA X and that the \nassets of IRA X would have to be transferred to another account in order to trade stocks. \nFollowing the custodian\u2019s advice, Trust T\u2019s trustees transferred substantially all of IRA X\u2019s \nassets to a non-IRA account held by the custodian for the benefit of Trust T.  \n \nSeveral months have passed since the transfer of IRA X\u2019s assets to the non-IRA account.  \nYou request that the transfer be permitted to be reversed, so that the assets in the non-\nIRA account may be transferred to an inherited IRA account for the benefit of Trust T.   \n \nTaxpayer is requesting the following rulings: \n \n1. Trust T may transfer IRA X\u2019s assets currently held in the non-IRA account into an \ninherited IRA for the benefit of Trust T, either with the present custodian or a \ndifferent custodian. \n \n2. Trust T will not be required to include in gross income for federal income tax \npurposes, for Year 1 in which the distribution from IRA X occurred and for the year \nin which the subsequent transfer is made pursuant to ruling number 1, any portion \nof the amounts transferred from IRA X to an inherited IRA.   \n \n3. The transfer into an inherited IRA pursuant to ruling numbers 1 and 2 can be made \nto any inherited IRA and does not need to be made back into IRA X. \n \nApplicable Law \n \nSection 408(a) states that the term \u201cindividual retirement account\u201d means a trust created \nor organized in the United States for the exclusive benefit of an individual or his \nbeneficiaries, but only if the written governing instrument creating the trust meets certain \nrequirements. \n \nSection 408(d)(1) provides that, except as otherwise provided in section 408(d), any \namount paid or distributed out of an IRA is included in gross income by the payee or \ndistributee, as the case may be, in the manner provided under section 72. \n \nSection 408(d)(3)(A) provides, in part, that section 408(d)(1) does not apply to an amount \npaid or distributed out of an IRA to the individual for whose benefit the account is \nmaintained if the entire amount received is paid into an IRA for the benefit of that individual \nnot later than the 60th day after the day on which the individual receives the payment or \ndistribution. \n \nSection 408(d)(3)(C)(i) provides, in part, that, in the case of an inherited IRA, section \n408(d)(3) does not apply to any amount received by an individual from that inherited IRA.  \n \nSection 408(d)(3)(C)(ii) provides that an IRA is treated as an inherited IRA if the individual \n \nPLR-125312-20 \n \n3 \nfor whose benefit the IRA is maintained acquired the IRA by reason of the death of \nanother individual, and the individual is not the surviving spouse of the other individual. \n \nSection 1.408-2(a) provides, in part, that an IRA may be established and maintained by \nan individual, by an employer for the benefit of his employees, or by an employee \nassociation for the benefit of its members.  \n \nSection 1.408-2(b)(8) provides that the term \u201cbeneficiaries\u201d on whose behalf an individual \nretirement account is established includes (except where the context indicates otherwise) \nthe estate of the individual, dependents of the individual, and any person designated by \nthe individual to share in the benefits of the account after the death of the individual. \n \nSection 1.408-4(a)(1) provides, in general, that any amount actually paid or distributed \nfrom an individual retirement account shall be included in the gross income of the payee \nor distributee for the taxable year in which the payment or distribution is received. \n \nSection 7701(a)(1) provides that the term \u201cperson\u201d shall be construed to mean and \ninclude an individual, a trust, estate, partnership, association, company or corporation. \n \nRevenue Ruling 78-406, 1978-2 C.B. 157, provides that the trustee-to-trustee transfer of \nfunds from one IRA maintained for the benefit of an individual to another IRA maintained \nfor the benefit of the same individual does not constitute a payment or distribution \nincludible in gross income. \n \nAnalysis  \n \nWith regard to your first ruling request, upon Decedent A\u2019s death IRA X became an \ninherited IRA for the benefit of Trust T.  Assets in an inherited IRA for the benefit of a trust \nare not permitted to be rolled over under section 408(d)(3).  The only permitted method \nof transferring assets from an inherited IRA to another inherited IRA is via a trustee-to-\ntrustee transfer, which requires a direct transfer from one IRA to another IRA. Therefore, \nonce the assets have been distributed from an inherited IRA, there is no permitted method \nof transferring them back into an IRA.  In this case, the assets of IRA X were transferred \nto a non-IRA account.  Accordingly, the assets may not now be transferred to an IRA \naccount. \n \n \nWith regard to your second ruling request, section 408(d) provides that, except with \nrespect to investment in the contract, assets distributed out of an inherited IRA are \nincluded in gross income.  Accordingly, Trust T will be required to include in gross income \nfor Year 1, the year in which the distribution from IRA X occurred, any portion of the \namounts transferred from IRA X that is not investment in the contract.   \n \nWith regard to your third ruling request, as also set forth in the first ruling, Trust T may not \ntransfer IRA X\u2019s assets currently held in the non-IRA account into any IRA account.  \n \nPLR-125312-20 \n \n4 \n \nThis letter ruling assumes that IRA X satisfied the requirements of section 408 at all times \nrelevant before the transfer of IRA X\u2019s assets to the non-IRA account. \n  \nThe rulings contained in this letter ruling are based upon information and representations \nsubmitted by Trust T and accompanied by a penalty of perjury statement executed by an \nappropriate party, as specified in Rev. Proc. 2021-1, 2021-1 I.R.B. 1, \u00a7 7.01(16)(b). This \noffice has not verified any of the material submitted in support of the request for ruling, \nand such material is subject to verification on examination. The Associate office will \nrevoke or modify a letter ruling and apply the revocation retroactively if there has been a \nmisstatement or omission of controlling facts; the facts at the time of the transaction are \nmaterially different from the controlling facts on which the ruling was based; or, in the \ncase of a transaction involving a continuing action or series of actions, the controlling \nfacts change during the course of the transaction. See Rev. Proc. 2021-1, \u00a7 11.05. \n \nExcept as expressly provided above, no opinion is expressed or implied concerning the \nfederal income tax consequences of any other aspects of any transaction or item of \nincome described in this letter ruling. \n  \nThis letter ruling is directed only to the taxpayer requesting it. Section 6110(k)(3) provides \nthat it may not be used or cited as precedent. \n \nIn accordance with the Power of Attorney on file with this office, a copy of this letter is \nbeing sent to your authorized representative. \n \nSincerely, \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n/s/ Neil Sandhu \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n______________________________ \n \n \n \n \n \n \nNeil Sandhu \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSenior Technician Reviewer \nQualified Plans Branch 1 \n \n \n \n \n \n \nOffice of the Associate Chief Counsel \n(Employee Benefits, Exempt Organizations, \nand Employment Taxes) \n \n \ncc: \n \n \n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Adverse"}]}

In the letter, your representatives requested a ruling that the tax consequences \nof the warrants Taxpayer issued on Date 1 be recognized as an expense when they \nbecome exercisable by their owners, the subsidiaries of Company A and Company B. \nPLR-122710-15\n2\nThe request is based on sections 1.461-1(a)(2) and 1.83-7(a) of the Income Tax \nRegulations.\nFACTS\nTaxpayer is a United States corporation which is the parent company of a consolidated \ngroup for U.S. federal income tax purposes, which includes a wholly owned subsidiary, \nTaxpayer\u2019s Subsidiary, as well as other U.S. subsidiaries.  Taxpayer and its subsidiaries \nuse the accrual method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes and their \ntaxable year ends on Date 2 of each year. \nOne of the businesses in which Taxpayer is engaged is the business of purchasing and \ndistributing Products to a variety of providers.  Taxpayer\u2019s ability to obtain these \nproducts from manufacturers in necessary volume and with favorable pricing is critical \nto satisfying its customers. \nOn Date 1, Taxpayer and Taxpayer\u2019s Subsidiary entered into several contracts with \nCompany A, a domestic corporation, Company B, a foreign corporation, and Company \nC, a foreign corporation owned by Company A and B.  The goal of these contracts was \nto increase the purchasing power of the parties involved with an objective to realize \nimproved pricing for Products.  Central to the new relationship was the execution of a D \nyear purchasing services agreement ----------------------------------------------whereby \nTaxpayer, through Taxpayer\u2019s Subsidiary, ------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n----------------------------------.  Taxpayer remained responsible -------------------------------------\n----------------------------------------------------------- in the various contracts mentioned above. \nIn addition, Company C was required to ---------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------.  Company C also agreed to -------------------------------------------\n---------------------------------------------------------------.  In addition to requiring performance of \nthe above services, ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------.\nAs part of the agreements, Taxpayer granted contingent equity rights, or warrants, \nsubject to the performance requirements stated above, to each of Company A and \nCompany B (via their respective subsidiaries) to acquire E shares in Taxpayer between \nDate 3 and Date 4 of Year 1 at $X per share and to each company to acquire another E \nshares in Taxpayer between Date 5 and Date 6 of Year 2 at $Y per share.  At the time \nthe warrants were issued, the warrants did not have an ascertainable fair market value \nas defined in Section 1.83-7(b) of the Income Tax Regulations because, among other \nthings, they were not actively traded on an established market and were not exercisable \nimmediately in full by the recipient.  The shares acquired pursuant to the exercise of the \nwarrants will not be subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture, and therefore, will be \nsubstantially vested within the meaning of section 1.83-3(b) of the Income Tax \nRegulations at the time of exercise of the warrants. \nPLR-122710-15\n3\nTaxpayer granted the stock warrants when Company A, Company B, and \nCompany C signed a contract for Company C to perform services. At the time of the \ngrant, the then price of Taxpayer\u2019s stock was $Z, less than the exercise prices of the \nwarrant tranches under the agreements.  Taxpayer\u2019s goal was to provide appropriate \nlong-term incentives for Company C to perform its duties under the agreement \neffectively.  The agreements provided that if Company C failed to perform its duties \nunder the agreements in a satisfactory and successful manner, Taxpayer had the right \nunder the agreements to terminate them and cancel the warrants granted to Company \nA and Company B.  Thus, the warrants would only become exercisable in Year 1 and \nYear 2 if Company C had fully complied with the terms of the agreements, including the \nperformance of the required services, up to the applicable points in time.  \nLAW AND ANALYSIS\nSection 162(a) of the Code allows a deduction for the ordinary and necessary expenses \npaid or incurred during the taxable year in carrying on any trade or business.  Section \n162(a)(1) includes a reasonable allowance for salaries or other compensation for\npersonal services actually rendered as an ordinary and necessary business expense.\nSection 1.461-1(a)(2)(i) of the Income Tax Regulations provides in part that under an \naccrual method of accounting, a liability is incurred, and is generally taken into account \nfor federal income tax purposes, in the taxable year in which: (1) all the events have \noccurred that establish the fact of the liability, (2) the amount of the liability can be \ndetermined with reasonable accuracy, and (3) economic performance has occurred with \nrespect to the liability.  \nSection 1.461-4 of the Regulations provides rules for determining when economic \nperformance occurs with respect to liabilities arising out of the performance of services, \nthe transfer of property, or the use of property, interest on debt, assumption of liabilities \nin connection with the sale of a trade or business, and certain other liabilities. \nSection 1.461-4(d)(2)(i) of the Regulations generally provides that if the liability of a \ntaxpayer arises out of the providing of services or property to the taxpayer by another \nperson, economic performance occurs as the services or property is provided.\nSection 83(a) provides that if, in connection with the performance of services, property \nis transferred to any person other than the person for whom such services are \nperformed, the excess of the fair market value of such property over the amount (if any) \npaid for such property, shall be included in the gross income of the person who \nperformed such services in the first taxable year in which the rights of the person having \nthe beneficial interest in such property are transferable or are not subject to a \nsubstantial risk of forfeiture, whichever is applicable. \nPLR-122710-15\n4\nSection 1.83-3(b) of the Regulations provides that property is substantially vested when \nit is either transferable or not subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture.\nSection 1.83-3(f) of the Regulations provides that property transferred in recognition of \nthe performance of, or the refraining from performance of, services is considered \ntransferred in connection with the performance of services within the meaning of section \n83. The section also provides that the transfer of property is subject to section 83 \nwhether such transfer is in respect of past, present, or future services.\nSection 83(e)(3) provides that section 83 does not apply to a stock option (which is \nequivalent to a stock warrant) without a readily ascertainable fair market value.\nSection 1.83-7(a) of the Regulations states that if section 83(a) does not apply to the \ngrant of an option because the option does not have a readily ascertainable fair market \nvalue at the time of grant, sections 83(a) and 83(b) shall apply at the time the option is \nexercised or otherwise disposed of, even though the fair market value of such option \nmay have become readily ascertainable before such time.  If the option is exercised, \nsections 83(a) and 83(b) apply to the transfer of property pursuant to such exercise, and \nthe employee or independent contractor realizes compensation upon such transfer at \nthe time and in the amount determined under section 83(a) or 83(b).  \nSection 83(h) provides that the service recipient may take a deduction in an amount \nequal to the amount included under section 83 in the gross income of the person who \nperformed such services. Furthermore, the deduction is allowed only for the taxable \nyear of such person in which or with which ends the taxable year in which such amount \nis included in the gross income of the person who performed such services.\nSection 1.83-6(a)(3) provides that where property is substantially vested upon transfer, \nthe deduction shall be allowed to such person in accordance with his method of \naccounting (in conformity with sections 446 and 461).\nThus, when a service provider exercises a stock option (or stock warrant) for \nsubstantially vested stock, pursuant to section 83, the fair market value of the stock \n(minus the exercise price) is included in the service provider\u2019s gross income. Pursuant \nto section 1.83-6(a)(3), the service recipient may take a deduction for the amount \nincluded in the service provider\u2019s gross income upon the service provider\u2019s exercising \nthe stock option (or stock warrant) in accordance with his method of accounting (in \nconformity with sections 446 and 461).\nUnder section 1.461-1(a)(2)(i), all events have not occurred that establish the fact of the \nliability and determine it with reasonable accuracy until the contingencies surrounding \nthe issuance of the warrants have lapsed.  In contrast, economic performance will have \noccurred by the time the contingencies lapse because services by then will have \nalready been provided to Taxpayer.  Thus, the only question is whether the contingency \nlapse occurs when the warrants become exercisable or exercised.  The warrants are \nPLR-122710-15\n5\nsubject to section 83 because Taxpayer granted the stock warrants to Company A and \nCompany B in connection with the performance of services -------------------------------------\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------for Taxpayer \non an ongoing basis.  Therefore, section 83 determines the timing of the contingency \nlapse. \nThe warrants did not have an ascertainable fair market value on the date of grant.  \nThus, under section 1.83-7(a) of the Regulations, sections 83(a) and 83(b) do not apply \non the issuance of the warrants or when they become exercisable, but become \napplicable only upon the warrants\u2019 exercise.  Pursuant to sections 83(h) and 1.83-\n6(a)(3), Taxpayer may claim a deduction in accordance with its method of accounting \n(in conformity with sections 446 and 461) when the substantially vested E shares are \ntransferred to Company A and/or Company B, as applicable, upon exercise of the stock \nwarrants. \nCONCLUSION\nTaxpayer may recognize the tax consequences of the warrants issued to Company A \nand/or Company B, as applicable, when they are exercised.\nExcept as expressly provided herein, no opinion is expressed or implied concerning the \nfederal income tax consequences of any aspect of any transaction or item discussed or \nreferenced in this letter.\nThis ruling is directed only to the taxpayer requesting it.  Section 6110(k)(3) of the Code \nprovides that it may not be used or cited as precedent.\nIn accordance with the Power of Attorney on file with this office, a copy of this letter is \nbeing sent to your authorized representative.\nA copy of this letter must be attached to any income tax return to which it is relevant. \nAlternatively, taxpayers filing their returns electronically may satisfy this requirement by \nattaching a statement to their return that provides the date and control number of the \nletter ruling.\nPLR-122710-15\n6\nThe rulings contained in this letter are based upon information and representations \nsubmitted by the taxpayer and accompanied by a penalty of perjury statement executed \nby an appropriate party.

Reg. \u00a7 1.956-2(a)(3) to a proposed partnership arrangement between a \ncontrolled foreign corporation (\u201cCFC\u201d), a related domestic corporation and an unrelated \nthird party. \nFACTS\nTaxpayer is a domestic corporation and the parent of a consolidated group.  US1 \nis a domestic corporation that is wholly owned by Taxpayer.  F1 is foreign corporation \nformed under the laws of Country B.  F1 is a CFC, as defined in section 957(a), and is \nwholly owned by a member of the Taxpayer\u2019s consolidated group.  F2 is foreign \ncorporation formed under the laws of Country B.  F2 is a CFC, as defined in section \n957(a), and is wholly owned indirectly by a member of the Taxpayer\u2019s consolidated \ngroup.  Prior to the proposed transaction, F2 was a dormant corporation and did not \nhold United States property, as defined in section 956(c) (\u201cUS Property\u201d). \nUS1 conducts business in the United States (the \u201cUS Business\u201d).  F1 directly and \nthrough its foreign subsidiaries conducts business outside the United States (the \u201cNon-\nUS Business\u201d).  The assets of the US Business would constitute US Property if held by \na CFC.  None of the assets of the Non-US Business constitute US property.\nAs part of a plan to expand the US Business and the Non-US Business by \nproviding access to additional capital and ------------------, Taxpayer intends to \nform a joint venture with FC, an unrelated third party.  This joint venture will be \nundertaken through the formation of LLP, a limited liability partnership organized \nunder the laws of Country A.  For valid business purposes, FC required the use \nof a single entity as a condition for participation in the joint venture.  LLP will be \nclassified as a partnership for federal income tax purposes.   \nUS1 will contribute $a for its partnership interest in LLP, F2 will contribute \n$b for its partnership interest in LLP, and FC will contribute $c for its partnership \ninterest in LLP.  F2 will obtain the $b through capital contributions from its \nshareholder or through loans.  Shortly thereafter, LLP will purchase the US \nPLR-134037-07\n3\nBusiness from US1 for $d in a taxable transaction, and the Non-US Business \nfrom F1 for $e in a taxable transaction.\nThe US Business and the non-US Business, including subsequently \nacquired assets, will be maintained in separate legal entities owned by LLP and \ndisregarded for federal income tax purposes (collectively designated as \u201cLLC1\u201d \nand \u201cLLC2\u201d for purposes of this ruling).  LLC1 and LLC2 will maintain separate \nbooks and records and funds will not be loaned or transferred between such \nentities.  LLC1 will own and conduct the US Business.  LLC2 will own and \nconduct the Non-US Business and will not acquire or hold US Property.  It is \nanticipated that FC will lend additional capital to LLP to fund the US Business \nand Non-US Business.\nThe LLP agreement specifies that F2 will share only in the income, gains, \ndeductions and losses of the Non-US Business and will have liquidation rights \nonly in assets of the Non-US Business.  F2 will not share in any income, gains, \ndeductions or losses from the US Business and will not have any rights to assets \nof the US Business upon a liquidation of the LLP.\nREPRESENTATIONS\nTaxpayer makes the following representations with respect to this ruling:\n(a)\nThe assets of the Non-US Business will not include US Property.\n(b)\nLLP will be classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax \npurposes, and US1, F2 and FC will each be a partner in LLP for U.S. federal income tax \npurposes.  \n(c)\nF2 will have no rights to share in any income, gain, deduction or loss of \nthe US Business and will have no right to receive any property from the US Business in \nliquidation of LLP.\n(d)\nThe allocations of income, gain, deduction and loss provided in the LLP \nagreement have substantial economic effect within the meaning of section 704(b).\n(e)\nThe US Business and the Non-US Business, activities of which are \nconducted within the LLP by LLC1 and LLC2 and with the involvement of FC, will each \noperate independently with its own employees in a manner that complies with all local \nlegal and regulatory requirements, including tax and transfer pricing.  \n(f) \nLLP will not own any assets other than the US Business and the Non-US \nBusiness.\nPLR-134037-07\n4\n(g)\nLLP or LLC2 will not lend to a U.S. person or hold any obligation of a U.S. \nperson other than obligations listed under section 956(c)(2).\n(h)\nLLC2 will not loan or otherwise transfer funds or amounts to LLC1.\n(i)\nThe economic rights of US1 in the Non-US Business and US Business are \nconsistent with the economic rights that US1 had in such businesses prior to the \nformation of LLP, and the economic rights of F2 in the Non-US Business and the US \nBusiness are consistent with the economic rights that F1 had in such businesses prior \nto the formation of LLP.\n(j)\nExcept for certain personnel changes and the involvement of FC in the \narrangement, the US Business and the Non-US Business will be conducted in \nsubstantially the same manner as prior to the formation of the LLP.\n(k)\nF2 will not be a direct or indirect pledgor or guarantor under Treas. Reg. \u00a7 \n1.956-2(c), and the Non-US Business will not serve at any time, even indirectly, as \nsecurity for the performance of an obligation of a United States person as provided in \nTreas. Reg. \u00a7 1.956-2(c)(2).\nLAW AND ANALYSIS\nSection 951(a) requires that a U.S. shareholder of a CFC that owns stock in such \ncorporation on the last day of the corporation\u2019s taxable year include in its gross income \nthe amount determined under section 956 with respect to such shareholder for such \nyear (but only to the extent not excluded from gross income under section 959(a)(2)).  \nSection 951(a)(1)(B).  \nThe amount determined under section 956 with respect to any U.S. shareholder \nfor any taxable year is generally the lesser of the excess of such shareholder\u2019s \u201cpro rata \nshare of the average of the amounts of United States property held (directly or \nindirectly) by the CFC as of the close of each quarter of such taxable year\u201d over (i) the \namount of previously taxed income described in section 959(c)(1)(A) with respect to \nsuch shareholder, or (ii) such shareholder\u2019s pro rata share of the applicable earnings of \nsuch CFC.  Section 956(a).  US Property is defined generally to include, among other \nthings, tangible property located in the United States.  Section 956(c); Treas. Reg. \n\u00a7 1.956-2(a).  For these purposes, the amount of US Property held by the CFC is \ndetermined with reference to the CFC\u2019s adjusted basis in such property.  Section \n956(a).\nThe purpose of section 956 is to prevent a CFC from repatriating earnings on \nwhich U.S. tax has been deferred by making investments in the United States.  See\nH.R. Rep. No. 97-1447 (1962), at 58.  Congress believed that U.S. shareholders of a \nPLR-134037-07\n5\nCFC should be taxed on such investments in the United States \u201con the grounds that this \nis substantially the equivalent of a dividend being paid to them.\u201d   S. Rep. No. 87-1881 \n(1962), at 88.\nTreasury Reg. \u00a7 1.956-2(a)(3) provides that:\nFor purposes of section 956, if a controlled foreign corporation is a \npartner in a partnership that owns property that would be United \nStates property . . . if owned directly by the controlled foreign \ncorporation, the controlled foreign corporation will be treated as \nholding an interest in the property equal to its interest in the \npartnership and such interest will be treated as an interest in United \nStates property.\nAccordingly, a CFC that has an economic interest in US Property through a \npartnership would be considered to have an interest in US Property for purposes of \nsection 956 in accordance with the substance of the arrangement.  On the other hand, a\nCFC that does not have, directly or indirectly, any economic interest in US Property \nthrough a partnership, including a profits interest, a capital interest, a liquidation right, or \nany other interest, does not have an interest in US Property for purposes of section 956.\nRULING\nIn the present case, with respect to US1, the US Business of LLP will be \nconducted in the same manner as before the formation of the LLP.  F2 will not have an \neconomic interest in the US Business conducted by LLC1, including a profit or capital \ninterest, liquidation rights, or any other interest.  As part of the LLP arrangement, LLC1 \nwill continue the pre-existing US Business in which F1 did not have an economic \ninterest prior to the formation of the LLP.  Therefore, because F2 will not have any \neconomic interest in the US Business after the formation of LLP, no economic interest in \nUS Property is being shifted from a CFC to a non-CFC, and LLC1 will not receive any \nloans, other funds or credit support from LLC2, we conclude that F2\u2019s status as a \npartner in LLP will not cause F2 to be treated as holding an interest in the US Business \nunder Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.956-2(a)(3). \nCAVEATS\nOther than expressly provided, no ruling is provided regarding the application of \nsection 956 or Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.956-2(a)(3), including the application of such provisions \nif the LLP agreement is modified to change the partners\u2019 interests or rights in the US \nBusiness or Non-US Business.  Further, no ruling is provided on the application of \nspecial partnership allocations to other Code sections, including, for example, section \nPLR-134037-07\n6\n875.  In addition, no opinion is expressed regarding the tax effects of the transfer of the \ninterests in the assets held by F1 to LLP.\nPursuant to a power of attorney on file with this office, a copy of this letter is \nbeing sent to your authorized representative.  A copy of this ruling letter should be \nattached to your Form 5471.  This ruling is directed to the taxpayer who requested it.  \nSection 6110(k)(3) provides that it may not be used or cited as precedent.  \nSincerely,\n________________\nPhyllis Marcus\nBranch Chief\nAssociate Chief Counsel\n(International, Branch 2)\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Non-Adverse"}]}

Y, a wholly owned subsidiary of X, is a life \ninsurance and annuity company that provides a variety of life insurance products, \nannuities, and other investment products to individuals and businesses in all 50 states \nand the District of Columbia. \n \n \nPLR-132788-06 \n \n \n2 \nTrust is an open-end management investment company organized under the laws of \nState.  The beneficial interests in Trust\u2019s property consist of transferable shares \n(Shares) in multiple segregated portfolios of assets, including portfolio Z, each with \nseparate investments.  The portfolios support X\u2019s and Y\u2019s variable contracts.  Shares of \nthe portfolios may only be purchased by domestic life insurance companies, either \ndirectly or through separate accounts of such companies.  X has nine separate \naccounts and Y has four separate accounts.    Premiums received by X and Y are \nallocated to their respective separate accounts.  Collectively, the accounts of X and Y \nown all of the Shares of the portfolios and have the right to purchase additional shares \nor have shares redeemed at any time. \n \nContract holders may specify in which separate account the premium is to be invested.  \nThe benefits X and Y pay to the contract holder are determined by reference to the \ninvestment return associated with, and the market value of, the relevant portfolio \nsupporting the variable contract.  However, the benefits under the variable contracts can \nvary significantly from the value of the Shares in the portfolios, especially where a \ncontract holder dies before his or her life expectancy.  The contract holder is typically \nentitled to a minimum payment, regardless of the portfolio\u2019s performance.  Typically, a \nvariable contract cannot be redeemed, within a specified period, without a penalty, nor \nsold at face value.  Furthermore, the Shares in the portfolios are owned by the \ninsurance company issuing the variable contract for federal income tax purposes.  The \ncontract holder only has claims against the insurance company issuing the variable \ncontract and not against the income, gains, losses, or distributions of the portfolios.  \nEach portfolio is currently a regulated investment company (RIC) within the meaning of \n\u00a7 851.   \n \nZ proposes to elect to be treated as a partnership.  Z requests a ruling that it will be \nclassified as a partnership and not a publicly traded partnership. \n \nX and Y make the following representations: \n1.  Trust is a business trust that has never held itself out to be a state law corporation.  \nEach portfolio is currently a separate RIC as defined in \u00a7 851(a). \n2.  Z will have at least two members, X and Y, investing through their separate \naccounts, and will elect to be treated as a partnership for federal tax purposes. \n3.  If Shares are sold to other insurance companies, the Shares will not be held by more \nthan 100 domestic life insurance companies. \n4.  If Shares are sold to other insurance companies, the Shares will only be issued to \nseparate accounts of domestic life insurance companies. \n5.  X and Y are and will be treated as the owners of the Shares in the portfolios for \nfederal income tax purposes.  \n6.  The assets of the separate accounts will be adequately diversified within the \nmeaning of \u00a7 817(h) and \u00a7 1.817-5(b) of the Income Tax Regulations. \n7.  Allocations of taxable income, gain, loss, deductions, and credits of the portfolios will \nbe made in accordance with \u00a7\u00a7 704(b) and (c), and except as required by \u00a7 704(c), \n \nPLR-132788-06 \n \n \n3 \neach holder of a Share will be allocated its share of each portfolio\u2019s income or loss \nwhich will be composed of a proportionate share of each item of the portfolio\u2019s income \nor loss. \n8.  Public access to Z is only available through the purchase of a variable contract. \n9.  The Shares are not and will not be traded on an established securities market. \n10.  The Shares are not and will not be regularly quoted by any person, such as a \nbroker or dealer, making a market in the shares. \n11.  No person regularly makes available, and will not make available, to the public \n(including customers or subscribers) bid or offer quotes with respect to the Shares or \nstands ready, or will stand ready, to effect buy or sell transactions at the quoted prices \nfor itself or on behalf of others. \n12.  No holder of Shares has, or will have, a readily available, regular, and ongoing \nopportunity to sell or exchange the Shares through a public means of obtaining or \nproviding information of offers to buy, sell, or exchange Shares. \n13.  There is no plan or intention for the redemption of Shares by Z to be combined with \nthe issuance of Shares in Z to a new partner. \n \nPartnership Ruling \n \nSection 301.7701-3(a) provides that a business entity that is not classified as a \ncorporation under \u00a7 301.7701-2(b)(1), (3), (4), (5), (6), (7), or (8) (an eligible entity) can \nelect its classification for federal tax purposes. \n \nSection 301.7701-3(b)(1)(i) provides that, unless it elects otherwise, a domestic eligible \nentity is classified as a partnership if it has two or more members. \n \nX and Y represent that Z will have at least two members and will elect pursuant to \n\u00a7 301.7701-3 to be classified as a partnership.  Provided Z has 2 or more members and \nmakes the entity classification election to be classified as a partnership, Z will be \nproperly classified as a partnership for federal tax purposes. \n \nPublicly Traded Partnership Ruling \n \nSection 7704(a) provides that except as provided in \u00a7 7704(c), a publicly traded \npartnership will be treated as a corporation. \n \nSection 7704(b) provides that the term \u201cpublicly traded partnership\u201d means any \npartnership if (1) interests in such partnership are traded on an established securities \nmarket and (2) interests in such partnership are readily tradable on a secondary market \n(or the substantial equivalent thereof). \n \nSection 1.7704-1(a)(2)(i) provides that for purposes of \u00a7 7704(b) and \u00a7 1.7704-1, an \ninterest in a partnership includes (A) any interest in the capital or profits of the \npartnership (including the right to partnership distributions); and (B) any financial \n \nPLR-132788-06 \n \n \n4 \ninstrument or contract the value of which is determined in whole or in part by reference \nto the partnership (including the amount of partnership distributions, the value of \npartnership assets, or the results of partnership operations). \n \nSection 1.7704-1(a)(3) provides that for purposes of \u00a7 7704(b) and \u00a7 1.7704-1, a \ntransfer of an interest in a partnership means a transfer in any form, including a \nredemption by the partnership or the entering into of a financial instrument or contract \ndescribed in \u00a7 1.7704-1(a)(2)(i)(B). \n \nSection 1.7704-1(c)(1) provides that for purposes of \u00a7 7704(b) and \u00a7 1.7704-1, interests \nin a partnership that are not traded on an established securities market (within the \nmeaning of \u00a7 7704(b) and \u00a7 1.7704-1(b)) are readily tradable on a secondary market or \nthe substantial equivalent thereof if, taking into account all of the facts and \ncircumstances, the partners are readily able to buy, sell, or exchange their partnership \ninterests in a manner that is comparable, economically, to trading on an established \nsecurities market. \n \nSection 1.7704-1(c)(2) provides that for purposes of \u00a7 1.7704-1(c)(1), interests in a \npartnership are readily tradable on a secondary market or the substantial equivalent \nthereof if (i) interests in the partnership are regularly quoted by any person, such as a \nbroker or dealer, making a market in the interests; (ii) any person regularly makes \navailable to the public (including customers or subscribers) bid or offer quotes with \nrespect to interests in the partnership and stands ready to effect buy or sell transactions \nat the quoted prices for itself or on behalf of others; (iii) the holder of an interest in the \npartnership has a readily available, regular, and ongoing opportunity to sell or exchange \nthe interest through a public means of obtaining or providing information of offers to buy, \nsell, or exchange interests in the partnership; or (iv) prospective buyers and sellers \notherwise have the opportunity to buy, sell, or exchange interests in the partnership in a \ntime frame and with the regularity and continuity that is comparable to that described in \nthe other provisions of \u00a7 1.7704-1(c)(2). \n \nSection 1.7704-1(d) provides that for purposes of \u00a7 7704(b) and \u00a7 1.7704-1, interests in \na partnership are not traded on an established securities market within the meaning of \n\u00a7 1.7704-1(b)(5) and are not readily tradable on a secondary market or the substantial \nequivalent thereof within the meaning of \u00a7 1.7704-1(c) (even if interests in the \npartnership are traded or readily tradable in a manner described in \u00a7 1.7704-1(b)(5) or \n(c)) unless (1) the partnership participates in the establishment of the market or the \ninclusion of its interests thereon; or (2) the partnership recognizes any transfers made \non the market by (i) redeeming the transferor partner (in the case of a redemption or \nrepurchase by the partnership); or (ii) admitting the transferee as a partner or otherwise \nrecognizing any rights of the transferee, such as a right of the transferee to receive \npartnership distributions (directly or indirectly) or to acquire an interest in the capital or \nprofits of the partnership. \n \nPLR-132788-06 \n \n \n5 \nThe Shares sold by X to the segregated asset accounts of other insurance companies \nare interests in the capital or profits of the portfolios.  Therefore, the Shares are \npartnership interests for purposes of \u00a7 7704(b).  See \u00a7 1.7704-1(a)(2)(i)(A).  The sale of \nShares to the segregated asset accounts of other insurance companies does not fall \nwithin the definition of trading on an established securities market as defined in  \n\u00a7 7704(b)(1) and \u00a7 1.7704-1(b).  Additionally, Shares may only be sold to the \nsegregated asset accounts of other insurance companies and (i) are not regularly \nquoted by any person, such as a broker or dealer, making a market in the interests; (ii) \nno person regularly makes available to the public (including customers or subscribers) \nbid or offer quotes with respect to the Shares and stands ready to effect buy or sell \ntransactions at the quoted prices for itself or on behalf of others; (iii) the Unit holder \ndoes not have a readily available, regular, and ongoing opportunity to sell or exchange \nthe interest through a public means of obtaining or providing information of offers to buy, \nsell, or exchange interests in the partnership; or (iv) prospective buyers and sellers do \nnot otherwise have the opportunity to buy, sell, or exchange Shares in a time frame and \nwith the regularity and continuity that is comparable to that described in the other \nprovisions of \u00a7 1.7704-1(c)(2). \n \nThe shares are not traded on an established securities market and the Shares are not \nreadily tradable on a secondary market (or substantial equivalent thereof).  Therefore, \nbased solely on the information submitted and the representations made, we conclude \nthat after Z elects to be classified as a partnership, Z will not be a publicly traded \npartnership. \n \nExcept as specifically set forth above, no opinion is expressed or implied concerning the \nfederal tax consequences of the facts described above under any other provision of the \nCode. \n \nThis ruling is directed only to the taxpayer who requested it.

This letter responds to your request.\nSettlor established Trust, a revocable inter vivos trust, on Date 1.  Settlor\namended and restated Trust in its entirety on Date 2 and further amended Trust in part\non Date 3.  The original trustees of Trust were Settlor, Spouse, A, and B.  Trust became\nirrevocable at the death of Settlor on Date 4.  Spouse died on Date 5.  The outgoing\ntrustees of Trust were C, D, and E.  The current income beneficiaries of Trust are\nSettlor\u2019s two daughters, F and G, and the three children of Settlor\u2019s deceased son A,\nnamely, E, I, and J.  The current interim trustees of Trust are E, G, and H.  \nArticle I of Trust provides in part that initially the \u2018Trust Property\u2019 shall consist of a\nshares of Stock of Company, a State corporation. \nArticle II of Trust provides that until the death, resignation or incapacity to serve\nof Settlor as a Trustee, there shall be four (4) Trustees.  Thereafter, there shall be three\n(3) Trustees, but Trust shall not fail for want of a Trustee or any number of Trustees. \nUpon the death, resignation, incapacity, or failure to qualify of one or more of the\nTrustees (other than Settlor), from time to time, the Trustee or Trustees then serving as\nsuch shall appoint sufficient additional Trustees to bring the number up to three (3); and\nif there is no Trustee serving as such, the successor Trustees shall be selected by the\nadult beneficiaries then entitled to receive the income, if any, under Section 2 and 3 of\nArticle III, voting in proportion to their interests in that income.  As the sole exception to\nthe foregoing, Spouse shall have power, by deed or will, to designate the person who\nsucceeds her as Trustee upon her death, resignation or incapacity; but if she does not\nexercise that power then her vacancy shall be filled by the other Trustees or adult\nbeneficiaries in the same way.  The Trustees, in selecting successor Trustees, shall\nselect persons who, at the time of selection, are top executives of Company, or one of\nits subsidiaries, but their determination as to that capacity shall be final.\nSection 1 of Article III of Trust provides that all of the net income from the Trust\nProperty earned during the lifetime of Settlor shall be paid to Settlor from time to time\nas it is earned.  All other provisions in this Indenture for the payment or distribution of\nincome or principal shall be deemed to refer solely to periods after the death of Settlor.\nSection 2 of Article III of Trust provides that all of the net income from the Trust\nProperty shall be paid to Settlor\u2019s wife, Spouse, during her lifetime.  Payments shall be\nmade on the 25th days of January, April, July and October in each year.\n4\nPLR-104663-01\nSection 3 of Article III of Trust provides that all of the net income from the Trust\nProperty after the death of Settlor\u2019s wife, Spouse, shall be paid to Settlor\u2019s descendants\nliving from time to time as such income is earned, in equal shares per stirpes and not\nper capita.  Payments shall be made on the 25th day of January, April, July and October\nin each year.\nSection 4 of Article III of Trust provides that twenty-one (21) years after the death\nof the survivor of a class composed of Settlor\u2019s wife, Spouse, and all of Settlor\u2019s\ndescendants living at the time of the execution of this Second Amendment to this\nIndenture, the Trust Property shall vest in and be distributed to Settlor\u2019s descendants\nliving at that time, in equal shares per stirpes and not per capita, and Trust shall\nterminate. \nSection 1 of Article IV of Trust provides that the purpose in putting into this Trust\nStock of Company is to maintain the majority voting power of that corporation in\nexperienced and responsible persons who will preserve the established Policy and\nintegrity of the Businesses controlled by that corporation.  The Trustees are directed not\nto sell, lease, exchange, pledge or otherwise dispose of Stock of Company or any of it,\nin any way.  The Trustees shall have power to participate in reorganizations and\nrecapitalizations of Company, including, without limiting the generality thereof, mergers\nand consolidations, but not if, as a result, the Trust Property would consist of a smaller\nproportion of the voting power of Company, or any corporation into which it was merged\nor consolidated, than its proportion of the voting power of Company at the time of the\nexecution of this Second Amendment to this Indenture.  This limitation shall last for the\nduration of Trust, except that if at any time after Settlor\u2019s death, the Trustees then\nserving unanimously determine that substantially complete loss of the value of the Trust\nProperty is seriously threatened thereby, and obtain the written consent of two-thirds\n(2/3) of the adults, if any, then entitled to income under Article III, this limitation shall\nbecome void.\nSection 2 of Article IV of Trust provides that it is expected that the initial Trustees\nwill be, and future Trustees may be, directors, officers, employees, or otherwise\ninterested in Company, and corporations in which it is interested.  This is to be\nencouraged.  No Trustee shall be disqualified because of such a relationship, or\nbecause he or she receives a salary or other emolument from any such corporation. \nAny Trustee shall be entitled, if a director, to vote for himself or herself as such an\nofficer or employee; and the Trustees shall be entitled to vote stock constituting part of\nthe Trust Property in favor of themselves as directors.\nSection 6 of Article IV of Trust provides that in determining what corporate\ndistributions are income and what corporate distributions are principal, for the purposes\nof determining income and principal under Article III of this Indenture, no voting stock or\nother security of Company, or any other corporation into which it was merged or\nconsolidated, shall ever be considered to be income, but shall always be considered to\n5\nPLR-104663-01\nbe principal, and shall be distributed only pursuant to the provisions of Article III,\nSection 4.  In the administration of Trust, no charges shall be made against principal\nbut charges shall be made only against income, even though they are among the\ncharges listed in the statute commonly cited as State Statute 1; it being deemed\nimportant by Settlor, in order to accomplish the purpose of Trust as set forth in Article\nIV, Section1, of this Indenture, to protect the principal against any charge of any kind.\nSection 9 of Article IV of Trust provides in part that the Trustees shall act, on\nevery matter within their power and discretion, by the vote of a majority of the persons\nthen serving as Trustees.\nIn Year 1, the outgoing trustees determined that a substantially complete loss of\nthe value of the Trust Property was seriously threatened and, ultimately, concluded that\nin order to preserve the interests of all current and future beneficiaries as originally\ncontemplated by Settlor, it was in Trust\u2019s and all beneficiaries\u2019 interests to sell the\nCompany stock.  All the adult income beneficiaries of Trust gave their consent. \nAccordingly, the Trust\u2019s restriction on the sale of the Company stock provided in\nSection 1 of Article IV of Trust became void and, subsequently, the Company stock was\nsold for approximately $b.  Because the Company shares held by Trust had a low\nbasis, Trust now faces capital gains taxes of approximately $c.\nOn Date 6, the outgoing trustees of Trust submitted Petition to Court.  On the\nsame day, Court issued Preliminary Order granting conditional approval of the\nproposed changes and ordering that implementation of the changes be deferred,\npending the receipt of a favorable private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue\nService.  \nCertain proposed changes that were requested by Trust and conditionally\napproved by Court in \u00a7\u00a7 3, 4, 5, and 6 b. through d. of Preliminary Order are the subject\nof this ruling request.   They are as follows:\n3.        The Trustees are hereby instructed that the restriction on the application\nof the provisions of State Statute 1 set forth in Article IV, Section 6 of Trust expired\ncontemporaneously with the sale of the Company shares.  All charges for periods\nbeginning with the sale shall be charged against either income or principal in the\nmanner set forth in State Statute 1.\n4.        The Trustees are hereby instructed that the following safe harbor\ninvestment standard in lieu of the investment direction set forth in Article IV, Section 1,\nshall govern the actions of the successor trustees and their successors in making future\ninvestment decisions:\nThe Trustees shall perform the duties required of them by State Statute 2,\nbut the Trustees shall be relieved from liability for alleged breaches of\n6\nPLR-104663-01\nduties to beneficiaries under State Statute 3 if at least fifty percent (50%)\nof the Trust\u2019s assets regularly remain invested in a diversified portfolio of\npublicly traded assets held for long term capital appreciation (with any\nreallocations made not less often than quarterly).\n5.       The Trustees are hereby authorized to partition Trust into three trusts,\neach to be administered pursuant to the provisions of the Trust Indenture, subject to the\nfollowing modifications:\na.\nEffective upon the entry of Court\u2019s Final Order approving the\npartition described herein, the Trustees are authorized to divide the\nremaining trust corpus (net of a reasonable reserve in an amount\nsufficient to satisfy any remaining liabilities of the predecessor\ntrust) into three equal shares, each of which having assets with\nequal value and having in the aggregate, equal income tax basis. \nEach share shall be designated as being held for the benefit of a\nFamily Line headed by a child of Settlor.\nb.\nThe Trustees, as named in this Order, shall hold each share as a\nseparate trust.\nc.\nFor purposes of Article III of each new trust, the descendants of\nSettlor entitled to receive distributions of income and/or principal\nare limited to the members of the respective Family Line for which\nthe new trust is created.  A \u201cFamily Line,\u201d for this purpose, shall\nmean (A) the descendants of A, (B) F and the descendants of F,\nand (C) G and the descendants of G, respectively.\nd.\nUnless a separate trust is earlier terminated under the\ncircumstances described in 5.e., below, each separate trust shall\nterminate as of the vesting and distribution date identified in Article\nIII, Section 4 of the Trust Indenture.  The separate trust shall\ndistribute the trust property to the then living descendants of Settlor\nbelonging to the applicable Family Line, per stirpes.\ne.\nA separate trust shall terminate prior to the final distribution date on\nthe date of death of the last descendant of Settlor belonging to the\nrespective Family Line, prior to the final distribution date.  In such\nan event, the corpus and any undistributed income in such trust\nshall be divided equally between the remaining two trusts created\nunder this instrument, if both such trusts are still in existence, or\nshall be transferred to the only remaining trust created under this\ninstrument, if only one such trust is in existence.  Except to the\nextent specifically set forth in this subparagraph 5.e., no\n7\nPLR-104663-01\ndescendant belonging to a Family Line other than the Family Line\nfor which the separate trust is held shall have any claim to income\nor principal from any other separate trust.\nf.\nEach separate trust, at all times, shall have a trustee as provided in\nParagraph 6 of this Order.\ng.\nFollowing the partition hereunder and the winding up of the affairs\nof the predecessor trust, unless each of the adult income, potential\nincome and remainder beneficiaries and the guardian ad litem\nappointed to represent the minor and unborn beneficiaries of Trust\nhas previously released the Trustees, the Trustees shall have thirty\ndays to prepare a final accounting for the predecessor trust, and\nprovide the accounting to each of the persons heretofore described\nin this sentence.  The final accounting will be deemed approved,\nand the Trustees discharged from any liability to the beneficiaries, if\nno objections thereto are filed by any interested party during the\nthirty days thereafter.\nh.\nThe determination of this Court relating to charges to principal and\nfuture investment standard as set forth in Paragraphs 3 and 4 of\nthis Order shall be deemed incorporated into each of the three\nsuccessor trusts.\ni.\nState law shall at all times continue to govern each separate trust.\n6.       The Trustees are hereby authorized to take the following actions regarding\nsuccessor trustees:\nb. \nAfter the partition of Trust into three separate trusts (one trust for\neach Family Line), each separate trust, at all times, shall have one\nindividual co-trustee and one corporate co-trustee.  Pursuant to the\nconditional appointment letters, the initial individual co-trustee of\neach trust shall be as follows: (i) the initial individual co-trustee of\nthe trust for the benefit of the A Family Line shall be E, (ii) the initial\nindividual co-trustee of the trust for the benefit of the F Family Line\nshall be H, and (iii) the initial individual co-trustee of the trust for the\nbenefit of the G Family Line shall be G.\nc.\nThe individual co-trustee serving from time to time shall appoint a\ncorporate co-trustee and shall be entitled to remove and replace\nany corporate co-trustee serving from time to time without cause,\nbut upon reasonable notice; provided, however, that any corporate\nco-trustee shall be a bank or other entity authorized to administer\n8\nPLR-104663-01\ntrusts, holding trust assets at the time of its appointment with a fair\nmarket value of at least one hundred times as large as the fair\nmarket value of the principal of the separate Trust.  A corporate co-\ntrustee appointed in accordance herewith (i) will not be liable for\nany acts or omissions of predecessor trustees and will not be liable\nfor failing to institute any action against any predecessor trustee; (ii)\nshall be bound as a condition of acceptance of that position, that it\nwill submit to the jurisdiction and venue of the courts based on the\nresidence of the individual co-trustee; (iii) shall indemnify the\nindividual co-trustee against liability for investments or other actions\ntaken by the corporate co-trustee without the expressed knowledge\nand consent of the individual co-trustee; and (iv) in addition to the\nreports mandated by Article IV, Section 3, shall provide an annual\nstatement of the Trust\u2019s activity to each current and potential adult\nbeneficiary.  This Paragraph 6.c. shall not be construed to limit the\nrights of beneficiaries to pursue an accounting against any\npredecessor trustee.  \nd.\nIn the event of the death, resignation or incapacity of any initial\nindividual co-trustee, a successor individual Trustee shall be\nselected as follows: \ni.\nExcept as provided in subparagraph 6.d.ii. below, a majority\nin interest of the adult current income beneficiaries\nbelonging to a Family Line (including, for this purpose, any\nadult income beneficiaries who become current income\nbeneficiaries as a result of the death of a beneficiary who is\nalso serving as trustee) will select a successor individual\ntrustee to replace the deceased, incapacitated, or resigned\nindividual trustee representing that Family Line.  In the event\nno person can attain the requisite majority vote, within ninety\n(90) days after the creation of a vacancy, the successor\nindividual trustee shall be named in accordance with an\nInstrument Appointing Successor Individual Trustee, lodged\nwith the trust records by the deceased, incapacitated, or\nresigning trustee.  In the event neither of the aforementioned\nmethods results in the appointment of a successor individual\ntrustee, the successor individual trustee shall be the oldest\nnon-incapacitated adult income beneficiary among the\ndescendants of Settlor belonging to the affected Family Line. \nIf there are no non-incapacitated adult current income\nbeneficiaries among the descendants of Settlor belonging to\nthe affected Family Line, then the corporate co-trustee then\nserving at the time of the death, resignation or incapacity of\n9\nPLR-104663-01\nthe predecessor individual trustee shall serve as the sole\ntrustee until an eligible individual successor trustee can be\nappointed pursuant to this Paragraph 6.d.i.\nii.  \n(A)\nIn the event of death, incapacity, or resignation of G,\nas a trustee, her immediate successor shall be\nnamed in accordance with the most recent Instrument\nAppointing Successor Individual Trustee, lodged with\nthe trust records prior to the time of her death,\nincapacity, or resignation.  The Instrument Appointing\nSuccessor Individual Trustee may either name her\nimmediate successor or provide a procedure for\nselecting her immediate successor, in either case,\nfrom among her own children.  In the event no such\nInstrument is found among the trust records, the\nprovisions of Paragraph 6.d.i. shall apply.\n(B)\nIn the event of the death, incapacity, or resignation of\nH, as an individual trustee, during the lifetime of F, his\nimmediate successor shall be appointed by F, if she\nis then not incapacitated, or if F is then incapacitated,\nhis immediate successor shall be named in\naccordance with the most recent Instrument\nAppointing Successor Individual Trustee, executed by\nF and lodged with the trust records prior to the time of\nhis death, incapacity, or resignation.  The Instrument\nAppointing Successor Individual Trustee may either\nname the immediate successor to H or provide a\nprocedure for selecting his immediate successor, in\neither case, from among the children of F.  In the\nevent no such Instrument is found among the trust\nrecords, or in the event that the death, incapacity, or\nresignation of H occurs after the death of F, the\nprovisions of Paragraph 6.d.i. shall apply.\niii.  \nAny successor individual trustee determined hereunder\npursuant to Paragraph 6.d.i. or ii. shall be required to be an\nindividual belonging to the same Family Line as the\ndeceased, incapacitated, or resigning trustee.  A \u201cFamily\nLine\u201d for this purpose, shall mean (A) the descendants of A,\n(B) F and the descendants of F, and (C) G and the\ndescendants of G, respectively.\niv.  \n\u201cIncapacity\u201d in the case of an individual trustee shall mean\n10\nPLR-104663-01\nfailure to have the capacity described in State Statute 4.\nYou represent that there have been no actual or constructive additions to Trust\nafter September 25, 1985.\nYou have requested the following rulings:\n1.  Trust is exempt from the Generation-Skipping Transfer (GST) tax\nimposed by \u00a7 2601.\n2.  The implementation of Court\u2019s Final Order by the current interim\ntrustees of Trust will not subject Trust or any of the three resulting separate\ntrusts, or any distributions from Trust or from any of the three resulting separate\ntrusts, to the GST tax. \n3.  Following the proposed division of Trust into three equal trusts, the\nthree resulting separate trusts will be exempt from the GST tax as trusts that\nbecame irrevocable on or before September 25, 1985, and all distributions from\nany of the resulting separate trusts will be exempt from the GST tax.\nLaw and Analysis\nSection 2601 imposes a tax on every generation-skipping transfer. \nSection 2611(a) provides that, for purposes of the GST tax, the term \u201cgeneration-\nskipping transfer\u201d means \n(1) a taxable distribution, \n(2) a taxable termination, and \n(3) a direct skip.  \nSection 2612(a)(1) provides that, for purposes of the GST tax, the term \u201ctaxable\ntermination\u201d means the termination (by death, lapse of time, release of power, or\notherwise) of an interest in property held in a trust unless \u2013\n(A) immediately after such termination, a non-skip person has an interest\nin such property, or \n(B) at no time after such termination may a distribution (including\ndistributions on termination) be made from such trust to a skip person.  \nSection 2612(b) provides that, for purposes of the GST tax, the term \u201ctaxable\n11\nPLR-104663-01\ndistribution\u201d means any distribution from a trust to a skip person (other than a taxable\ntermination or a direct skip).\nSection 2612(c)(1) provides that, for purposes of the GST tax, the term \u201cdirect\nskip\u201d means a transfer subject to a tax imposed by chapter 11 or 12 of an interest in\nproperty to a skip person.\nSection 2613(a) provides that, for purposes of the GST tax, the term \u201cskip\nperson\u201d means \u2013 \n(1) a natural person assigned to a generation which is 2 or more\ngenerations below the generation assignment of the transferor, or \n(2) a trust \u2013  \n(A) if all interests in such trust are held by skip persons, or \n(B) if \u2013 \n(i) there is no person holding an interest in such trust, and \n(ii) at no time after such transfer may a distribution (including\ndistributions on termination) be made from such trust to a non-skip\nperson.\nSection 2613(b) provides that, for purposes of the GST tax, the term \u201cnon-skip\nperson\u201d means any person who is not a skip person. \nSection 26.2601-1(b)(1)(i) of the GST Tax Regulations provides in part that the\nGST tax does not apply to any generation-skipping transfer under a trust (as defined in\n\u00a7 2652(b)) that was irrevocable on September 25, 1985.  The rule of the preceding\nsentence does not apply to a pro rata portion of any generation-skipping transfer under\nan irrevocable trust if additions are made to the trust after September 25, 1985.\nSection 26.2601-1(b)(1)(ii)(A) provides that, except as provided in \n\u00a7 26.2601-1(b)(1)(ii)(B) or (C), any trust (as defined in \u00a7 2652(b)) in existence on\nSeptember 25, 1985, is considered an irrevocable trust.\nSection 26.2601-1(b)(4)(i)(C) provides that a judicial construction of a governing\ninstrument to resolve an ambiguity in the terms of the instrument or to correct a\nscrivener\u2019s error will not cause an exempt trust to be subject to the provisions of\nchapter 13, if \u2013\n(1) The judicial action involves a bona fide issue; and \n12\nPLR-104663-01\n(2) The construction is consistent with applicable state law that would be\napplied by the highest court of the state. \nSection 26.2601-1(b)(4)(i)(D) provides that \n(1) A modification of the governing instrument of an exempt trust\n(including a trustee distribution, settlement, or construction that does not satisfy\nparagraph (b)(4)(i)(A), (B), or (C) of this section) by judicial reformation, or\nnonjudicial reformation that is valid under applicable state law, will not cause an\nexempt trust to be subject to the provisions of chapter 13, if the modification\ndoes not shift a beneficial interest in the trust to any beneficiary who occupies a\nlower generation (as defined in \u00a7 2651) than the person or persons who held the\nbeneficial interest prior to the modification, and the modification does not extend\nthe time for vesting of any beneficial interest in the trust beyond the period\nprovided for in the original trust.\n(2) For purposes of this section, a modification of an exempt trust will\nresult in a shift in beneficial interest to a lower generation beneficiary if the\nmodification can result in either an increase in the amount of a GST transfer or\nthe creation of a new GST transfer.  To determine whether a modification of an\nirrevocable trust will shift a beneficial interest in a trust to a beneficiary who\noccupies a lower generation, the effect of the instrument on the date of the\nmodification is measured against the effect of the instrument in existence\nimmediately before the modification.  If the effect of the modification cannot be\nimmediately determined, it is deemed to shift a beneficial interest in the trust to a\nbeneficiary who occupies a lower generation (as defined in \u00a7 2651) than the\nperson or persons who held the beneficial interest prior to the modification.  A\nmodification that is administrative in nature that only indirectly increases the\namount transferred (for example, by lowering administrative costs or income\ntaxes) will not be considered to shift a beneficial interest in the trust.\nExample 5 of \u00a7 26.2601-1(b)(4)(i)(E), assuming there have been no additions to\nany trust after September 25, 1985, provides that in 1980, Grantor established an\nirrevocable trust for the benefit of his two children, A and B, and their issue.  Under the\nterms of the trust, the trustee has the discretion to distribute income and principal to A,\nB, and their issue in such amounts as the trustee deems appropriate.  On the death of\nthe last to die of A and B, the trust principal is to be distributed to the living issue of A\nand B, per stirpes.  In 2002, the appropriate local court approved the division of the\ntrust into two equal trusts, one for the benefit of A and A\u2019s issue and one for the benefit\nof B and B\u2019s issue.  The trust for A and A\u2019s issue provides that the trustee has the\ndiscretion to distribute trust income and principal to A and A\u2019s issue in such amounts as\nthe trustee deems appropriate.  On A\u2019s death, the trust principal is to be distributed\nequally to A\u2019s issue, per stirpes.  If A dies with no living descendants, the principal will\nbe added to the trust for B and B\u2019s issue.  The trust for B and B\u2019s issue is identical\n13\nPLR-104663-01\n(except for the beneficiaries), and terminates at B\u2019s death at which time the trust\nprincipal is to be distributed equally to B\u2019s issue, per stirpes.  If B dies with no living\ndescendants, principal will be added to the trust for A and A\u2019s issue.  The division of the\ntrust into two trusts does not shift any beneficial interest in the trust to a beneficiary who\noccupies a lower generation (as defined in \u00a7 2651) than the person or persons who\nheld the beneficial interest prior to the division.  In addition, the division does not extend\nthe time for vesting of any beneficial interest in the trust beyond the period provided for\nin the original trust.  Therefore, the two partitioned trusts resulting from the division will\nnot be subject to the provisions of chapter 13 of the Internal Revenue Code. \nBased on the information submitted and representations made, we conclude that \nthe proposed changes conditionally approved by Court in \u00a7\u00a7 3, 4, 5, and 6 b. through d.\nof Preliminary Order neither shift any beneficial interest in Trust to a beneficiary who\noccupies a lower generation (as defined in \u00a7 2651) than the person or persons who\nheld the beneficial interest prior to the implementation of the proposed changes nor\nextend the time for vesting of any beneficial interest in Trust beyond the period provided\nfor in the original terms of Trust.  Particularly, the proposed changes regarding the\ndivision of Trust are substantively analogous to the facts presented in Example 5 of \n\u00a7  26.2601-1(b)(4)(i)(E).  Thus, we conclude as follows: \n1.  Trust is exempt from the Generation-Skipping Transfer (GST) tax\nimposed by \u00a7 2601.\n2.  The implementation of Court\u2019s Final Order by the current interim\ntrustees of Trust will not subject Trust or any of the three resulting separate\ntrusts, or any distributions from Trust or from any of the three resulting separate\ntrusts, to the GST tax. \n3.  Following the proposed division of Trust into three equal trusts, the\nthree resulting separate trusts will be exempt from the GST tax as trusts that\nbecame irrevocable on or before September 25, 1985, and all distributions from\nany of the resulting separate trusts will be exempt from the GST tax.\nThis ruling is based on the facts presented and the applicable law in effect on the\ndate of this letter.  If there is a change in material fact or law (local or federal) before the\ntransactions considered in this ruling take effect, the ruling will have no force or effect.\nExcept as specifically ruled herein, we express or imply no opinion concerning\nthe federal tax consequences of this transaction under the cited provisions or any other\nprovisions of the Code.\nThis ruling is directed only to the taxpayer(s) requesting it.  Section 6110(k)(3) of\nthe Code provides that it may not be used or cited as precedent.\n14\nPLR-104663-01\nSincerely,\nLorraine E.

Additional information was submitted in a letter\ndated March 11, 2002.  The information submitted is summarized below.\nDistributing is the common parent of an affiliated group of corporations filing a\nconsolidated Federal income tax return.  Distributing owns all of the stock of several\nsubsidiaries, including Controlled.  Distributing has owned all of the stock of Controlled\nfor more than five years.  Controlled is a holding company that owns all of the stock of\nSub 1 and Sub 2.  Distributing is engaged directly and through certain of its subsidiaries\n(i.e., other than Controlled) in Business X.  Controlled is indirectly engaged, through its\nownership of Sub 1 and Sub 2, in Business Y.  Sub 1 and Sub 2 are directly engaged in \nBusiness Y.\nDistributing has two classes of stock outstanding, Class X stock and Class Y stock. \nThe Class X stock reflects the value of the entire Business X plus a% of Business Y. \nThe Class Y stock reflects b% of Business Y.\nDistributing started Business Y more than five years ago, building on the organizational\nand sales techniques it used in conducting Business X.  Initially, Business Y was\ndependent upon Distributing for financial, administrative and managerial support. \nHowever, as a mature and growing business, Business Y has begun to compete with\nBusiness X for management and financial resources as it developed a distinct and\nconflicting business model.  To resolve these issues, Distributing proposes the following\ntransaction:\n(i)\nDistributing will distribute a% of the Controlled stock pro rata to the\nholders of the Class X stock (the \u201cSpin-off\u201d).\n(ii)\n Distributing will distribute b% of the Controlled stock to the holders of the\nClass Y stock in exchange for all of their Class Y stock (the \u201cSplit-off\u201d). \nThe Spin-off and Split-off are sometimes collectively referred to as the\n\u201cDistribution.\u201d  Following the Distribution, the Class Y stock will be\ncancelled and Distributing will only have outstanding a single class of\ncommon stock.  Further, the board of directors of Distributing and\nControlled will not have any overlapping members.\n(iii)\nSubject to shareholder approval, Controlled will, prior to the Distribution,\ntransfer to Distributing an amount of money to reflect the risk to\nDistributing of a default by Controlled during the remaining term of certain\nleases for which Distributing has contingent liability.  Because Controlled\n3\nPLR-105619-02\n                                                                 \nwas not obligated to transfer this money to Distributing under the lease\nassignment, Distributing characterizes this transfer of money as a pre-\nDistribution dividend to Distributing and eliminated from its income under\nTreas. Reg. section 1.1502-13(f)(2).\nThe following representations have been made in connection with the proposed\ntransaction:\n(a) In the case of Distributing shareholders receiving Controlled stock in the Split-off,\nthe fair market value of Controlled stock and other consideration, if any, received\nby each shareholder of Class Y stock will approximately equal the fair market\nvalue of the Class Y stock surrendered by shareholders in the Split-off.\n(b) No part of the Controlled stock to be distributed by Distributing will be received\nby a shareholder of Distributing as a creditor, employee, or in any capacity other\nthan that of a shareholder of Distributing (including certain individuals who\nacquired stock of Distributing in connection with the performance of services and\nwhose stock remains subject to restrictions).\n(c) Distributing, Controlled and the Distributing shareholders will each pay their own\nexpenses, if any, incurred in connection with the transaction.\n(d) The five years of financial information submitted on behalf of Business X is\nrepresentative of its present operations and there have been no substantial\noperational changes in such business since the date of the last financial\nstatements submitted.\n(e) The five years of financial information submitted on behalf of Business Y is\nrepresentative of its present operations and there have been no substantial\noperational changes in such business since the date of the last financial\nstatements submitted.\n(f) Following the Distribution, Distributing will be engaged in the active conduct of\nBusiness X, independently and with its separate employees.\n(g) Following the Distribution, at least 90% of the fair market value of the gross\nassets of Controlled will consist of stock of controlled corporations that are\nengaged in the active conduct of Business Y, independently and with their\nseparate employees.\n(h) The distribution of the Controlled stock is carried out for the following corporate\nbusiness purpose: fit and focus.  The distribution of the stock of Controlled is\nmotivated, in whole or substantial part, by this corporate business purpose.\n(i) There is no plan or intention by any shareholder who owns 5% or more of the\nstock of Distributing, and management of Distributing, to its best knowledge, is\n4\nPLR-105619-02\n                                                                 \nnot aware of any plan or intention on the part of any remaining shareholder or\nsecurity holder of Distributing to sell, exchange, transfer by gift, or otherwise\ndispose of any of its stock in either Distributing or Controlled after the\nDistribution.\n(j) There is no plan or intention by either Distributing or Controlled, directly or\nthrough any subsidiary corporation, to purchase any of its outstanding stock after\nthe Distribution, other than possible purchases by Distributing or Controlled\npursuant to open market stock repurchase programs meeting the requirements\nof section 4.05(1)(b) of Rev. Proc. 96-30, 1996-1 C.B. 696.\n(k) There is no plan or intention to liquidate either Distributing or Controlled, to\nmerge either corporation with any other corporation, or to sell or otherwise\ndispose of any assets of either corporation subsequent to the Distribution except\nin the ordinary course of business.\n(l) Distributing neither accumulated its receivables or made extraordinary payment\nof their payables in anticipation of the transaction.\n(m) No intercorporate debt will exist between Distributing and Controlled at the time   \n           of, or subsequent to, the Distribution, except for short-term receivables, if any,     \n           arising out of lease assignments and the intercompany services agreement.\n(n) Payments made in connection with all continuing transactions, if any, between     \n           Distributing and Controlled will be for fair market value based on terms and          \n           conditions arrived at by the parties bargaining at arm\u2019s length.  Any assignment    \n           agreement between Sub 1 or Sub 2 and Distributing with respect to the                \n        leasehold interests held by Distributing are on arm\u2019s length terms.\n(o) Immediately before the Distribution, items of income, gain, loss, deduction and     \n           credit will be taken into account as required by the applicable intercompany          \n           transaction regulations (see Treas. Reg. sections 1.1502-13 and 1.1502-14 as in \n           effect before the publication of T.D. 8597, 1995-2 C.B. 147, and, as currently in   \n           effect, Treas.  Reg.  section 1.1502-13 as published by T.D. 8597).\n(p) The Class X stock and Class Y stock each constitutes stock of Distributing for      \n           Federal income tax purposes.\n(q) For purposes of section 355(d), immediately after the Distribution, no person        \n           (determined after applying section 355(d)(7)) will hold stock possessing 50           \n           percent or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of Distributing   \n           stock entitled to vote, or 50 percent or more of the total value of shares of all        \n           classes of Distributing stock, that was acquired by purchase (as defined in            \n5\nPLR-105619-02\n                                                                 \n           section 355(d)(5) and (8)) during the five year period (determined after applying   \n           section 355(d)(6)) ending on the date of the Distribution.\n(r) For purposes of section 355(d), immediately after the Distribution, no person         \n          (determined after applying section 355(d)(7)) will hold stock possessing 50            \n          percent or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of Controlled      \n          stock entitled to vote, or 50 percent or more of the total value of shares of all         \n          classes of Controlled stock, that was either: (i) acquired by purchase (as defined   \n          in section 355(d)(5) and (8)) during the five year period (determined after               \n          applying section 355(d)(6)) ending on the date of the Distribution or (ii)                  \n          attributable to distributions on Distributing stock that was acquired by purchase     \n          (as defined in section 355(d)(5) and (8)) during the five year period (determined    \n          after applying section 355(d)(6)) ending on the date of the Distribution.\n(s) The payment of cash in lieu of fractional shares of Controlled stock is solely for    \n           the purpose of avoiding the expense and inconvenience to Controlled of issuing   \n           and maintaining fractional shares and will not represent separately bargained for \n           consideration.  The total cash that will be paid in the transaction to Distributing     \n           shareholders in lieu of fractional shares of Controlled stock will not exceed one    \n           percent of the total consideration that will be distributed in the transaction.\n(t) The Distribution is not part of a plan or series of related transactions (within the     \n          meaning of section 355(e)) pursuant to which one or more persons will acquire     \n          directly or indirectly stock possessing 50 percent or more of the total combined     \n          voting power of all classes of stock of either Distributing or Controlled or stock       \n          possessing 50 percent or more of the total value of all classes of stock of either    \n          Distributing or Controlled.\nBased solely on the information submitted and on the representations set forth above, it\nis held as follows:\n1. No gain or loss will be recognized by Distributing from the distribution of\nControlled stock (section 355(c)).\n2. No gain or loss will be recognized by (and no amount will be included in the\nincome of) the holders of Class X or Class Y stock as a result of the Distribution\n(section 355(a)(1)).\n3. A Class Y stock shareholder who receives Controlled stock in the Split-off will\nhave an aggregate adjusted basis in the Controlled stock immediately after the\nSplit-off equal to the aggregate adjusted basis in the shareholder\u2019s Class Y stock\nsurrendered in the Split-off (section 358(a)(1)).\n6\nPLR-105619-02\n                                                                 \n4. A Class X shareholder who receives Controlled stock in the Spin-off will have an\naggregate adjusted basis of the Controlled and Distributing stock equal to the\naggregate adjusted basis of the Class X stock held immediately before the Spin-\noff, allocated between the Distributing and Controlled stock in proportion to the\nfair market value of each in accordance with Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.358-2(a) (section\n358(a)(1) and (b)).\n5. The holding period of the Controlled stock received by the Class Y stock\nshareholders in the Split-off will include the holding period of the Class Y stock\nsurrendered in exchange therefor, provided that such Class Y shares are held as\ncapital assets on the day of the Distribution.  Section 1223(1).\n6. The holding period of the Controlled stock received by the Class X stock\nshareholders in the Spin-off will include the holding period of the Class X stock\nwith respect to which such distribution is made, provided that such Class X\nshares are held as capital assets on the day of the Distribution.  Section 1223(1).\n7. Shareholders of Distributing who receive cash in lieu of fractional shares of\nControlled stock will recognize gain or loss measured by the difference between\nthe basis of the fractional share received and the amount of cash received\n(section 1001).  If the fractional share qualifies as a capital asset in the hands of\nthe shareholder, the gain or loss will be a capital gain or loss subject to the\nprovisions of Subchapter P of Chapter 1 of the Code.\n8. Earnings and profits will be allocated between Distributing and Controlled in\naccordance with section 312(h) and Treas. Reg. \u00a7\u00a7 1.312-10 and 1.1502-\n33(e)(3).\nExcept as expressly provided herein, no opinion is expressed or implied concerning the\ntax consequences of any aspect of any transaction or item discussed or referenced in\nthis letter.

The execution of the Construction Agreement, the Court\u2019s approval of the \nConstruction Agreement, the Trustee\u2019s creation of the Daughters\u2019 Trust pursuant \nto the authority provided in the Trust, and the Trustee\u2019s subsequent distribution of \nassets to the Daughters\u2019 Trust in accordance with the Construction Agreement \n \nPLR-104917-05 \n \n2 \ndo not result in a sale or exchange, or other disposition, of any property by any of \nthe children of Grantor, or the Trust, or the recognition of any gain or loss with \nrespect to any Trust assets; \n \n2. The execution of the Construction Agreement, the Court\u2019s approval of the \nConstruction Agreement, the Trustee\u2019s creation of the Daughters\u2019 Trust pursuant \nto the authority provided in the Trust, and the Trustee\u2019s subsequent distribution of \nassets to the Daughters\u2019 Trust in accordance with the Construction Agreement \ndo not cause the Daughters\u2019 Trust to receive more than its pro-rata share of the \ndistributable net income of the Trust through the date of funding; and \n \n3. The execution of the Construction Agreement, the Court\u2019s approval of the \nConstruction Agreement, the Trustee\u2019s creation of the Daughters\u2019 Trust pursuant \nto the authority provided in the Trust, and the Trustee\u2019s subsequent distribution of \nassets to the Daughters\u2019 Trust in accordance with the Construction Agreement \ndo not constitute, or result in, a taxable gift by the children of Grantor, or the \nTrustee, pursuant to section 2501. \n \nThe facts submitted are as follows: \n \n \nOn Date 1, Grantor created Trust.  Article II provides that Trust is irrevocable. \n \n \nArticle 3.01.A defines \u201cTrustor\u2019s Children\u201d as Son 1 and Son 2.  Article 3.01.B \nprovides that the trustee may distribute to Trustor\u2019s Children and their descendants so \nmuch net income and principal as will provide for the beneficiaries\u2019 health, education, \nmaintenance, and support.  Additionally, the trustee is to have the power to distribute to \n\u201cTrustor\u2019s children\u201d so much net income and principal as the trustee may determine to \nbe appropriate to assist in any business or investment venture.  Article 3.01.C provides \nthat Trust will terminate on the first to occur of (1) the second anniversary of Grantor\u2019s \ndeath, or (2) the death of the last survivor of Trustor\u2019s Children and their descendants.  \nUpon termination, the Trust assets will be administered in accordance with Articles 3.02 \nand 3.03. \n \n \nArticle 3.02 provides, in relevant part, that the trustee is to divide Trust into \nseparate equal shares, one share for each then living Child and one share for the then \nliving descendants, collectively, of each deceased Child. \n \n \nGrantor\u2019s two daughters, Daughter 1 and Daughter 2, alleged that the term \n\u201cTrustor\u2019s children\u201d included them, and thus, they were eligible for distributions to assist \nthem with business and investment ventures.  Questions also arose as to whether \nchildren born or adopted by Grantor after the Trust\u2019s creation would be eligible for \ndistributions.  On Date 2, the trustee petitioned County Court to construe and interpret \nseveral provisions of the Trust.  The County Court determined that any children born \nafter the Trust\u2019s creation were not beneficiaries of the Trust.  In order to settle the \nremaining disputes, the children entered into a Construction Agreement.  The trustee \n \nPLR-104917-05 \n \n3 \nrepresents that the Construction Agreement\u2019s interpretation of the ambiguities are \nconsistent with the County Court\u2019s earlier order on children born after Trust\u2019s creation. \n \n \nThe terms of the Construction Agreement call for the daughters as well as the \nsons to be eligible for Trust distributions to assist in any business or investment venture.  \nThe Construction Agreement also stipulates that the maximum distribution to the \ndaughters under the Trust would be 50 percent of the value of Trust on the date of the \ndistribution.  In order to prevent any future disagreements over distributions, the \nConstruction Agreement calls for the trustee to distribute 50 percent of the assets, on an \nin-kind pro rata basis, to a new trust for the benefit of the daughters.  The new trust will \nhave provisions substantially similar to the original Trust.  Once the new trust for the \nbenefit of the daughters has been created, no further distributions will be made from the \noriginal Trust for their benefit, except in the event of the death of one of the Sons (or a \ndescendant of one of the Sons) where that person is not survived by a descendant.  \nLikewise, no distributions from the Daughters\u2019 Trust would be made to the Sons or any \ndescendants of a Son except in the event of the death of one of the Daughters (or a \ndescendant of one of the Daughters) where that person is not survived by a \ndescendant.  On Date 3, County Court approved the Construction Agreement. \n \nLAW AND ANALYSIS \n \nRuling 1 \n \n \nSection 61(a)(3) provides that gross income includes gains derived from dealings \nin property and, under section 61(a)(15), from an interest in a trust. \n \n \nSection 1001(a) provides that the gain from the sale or other disposition of \nproperty is the excess of the amount realized over the adjusted basis provided in \nsection 1011 for determining gain, and the loss is the excess of the adjusted basis \nprovided in section 1011 for determining loss over the amount realized. \n \n \nSection 1001(b) provides that the amount realized from the sale or other \ndisposition of property is the sum of any money received plus the fair market value of \nthe property (other than money) received.  Under section 1001(c), except as otherwise \nprovided in subtitle A, the entire amount of gain or loss, determined under section 1001, \non the sale or exchange of property is recognized. \n \n \nSection 1.1001-1(a) of the Income Tax Regulations provides that the gain or loss \nrealized from the conversion of property into cash, or from the exchange of property into \nother property differing materially either in kind or in extent, is treated as income or loss \nsustained. \n \n \nA partition of jointly owned property is not a sale or other disposition of property if \nthe co-owners of the joint property sever their joint interests but do not acquire a new or \n \nPLR-104917-05 \n \n4 \nadditional interest as a result of the transaction.  Thus, neither gain nor loss is realized \non a partition.  See Rev. Rul. 56-437, 1956-2 C.B. 507. \n \n \nCottage Savings Ass\u2019n v. Commissioner, 499 U.S. 554 (1991), concerns the \nissue of when a sale or exchange has taken place that results in realization of gain or \nloss under section 1001.  In Cottage Savings, a financial institution exchanged its \ninterests in a different group of residential mortgage loans.  The two groups of \nmortgages were considered \u201csubstantially identical\u201d by the agency that regulated the \nfinancial institution. \n \n \nThe Supreme Court of the United States in Cottage Savings, 499 U.S. at 560-61, \nconcluded that section 1.1001-1 reasonably interprets section 1001(a) and stated that \nan exchange of property gives rise to a realization event under section 1001(a) if the \nproperties exchanged are \u201cmaterially different.\u201d  In defining what constitutes a \u201cmaterial \ndifference\u201d for purposes of section 1001(a), the Court stated that properties are \n\u201cdifferent\u201d in the sense that is \u201cmaterial\u201d to the Code so long as their respective \npossessors enjoy legal entitlements that are different in kind or extent.  Cottage \nSavings, 499 U.S. at 564-65.  The Court held that mortgage loans made to different \nobligors and secured by different homes did embody distinct legal entitlements, and that \nthe taxpayer realized losses when it exchanged interests in the loans.  Cottage Savings, \n499 U.S. at 566.   \n \n \nIt is consistent with the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in Cottage Savings to find that \nthe interests of the beneficiaries after the division will not differ materially from the \ninterests in the original Trust.  In accordance with the Construction Agreement, the Trust \nwill be divided on a pro rata basis.  Except for the changes described above, all other \nprovisions of Trust will remain unchanged.  Accordingly, the proposed transaction will \nnot result in a material difference in kind or extent of the legal entitlements enjoyed by \nthe beneficiaries.  Therefore, based on the facts presented and the representations \nmade, we conclude that the transaction will not result in a sale or exchange, or other \ndisposition, of any property, and no gain or loss is recognized by the children of Grantor \nor the trusts on the division for purposes of section 1001(a). \n \nRuling 2 \n \n \nSection 643(a) provides that the term \u201cdistributable net income\u201d means, with \nrespect to any taxable year, the taxable income of the estate or trust computed with \ncertain modifications. \n \n \nSection 661(a) provides that in any taxable year there shall be allowed as a \ndeduction in computing the taxable income of an estate or trust (other than a trust to \nwhich subpart B applies), the sum of (1) any amount of income for such taxable year \nrequired to be distributed currently (including any amount required to be distributed \nwhich may be paid out of income or corpus to the extent such amount is paid out of \nincome for such taxable year); and (2) any other amounts properly paid or credited or \n \nPLR-104917-05 \n \n5 \nrequired to be distributed for such taxable year, but such deduction is not to exceed the \ndistributable net income of the estate or trust. \n \n \nSection 662(a) provides generally that there is to be included in the gross income \nof a beneficiary to whom an amount specified in section 661(a) is paid, credited, or \nrequired to be distributed the sum of the following amounts: (1) the amount of income \nfor the taxable year required to be distributed currently to such beneficiary, whether \ndistributed or not; and (2) all other amounts properly paid, credited, or required to be \ndistributed to such beneficiary for the taxable year.  Section 662(a), however, limits the \namount of trust distributions included in the gross income of a beneficiary to the \ndistributable net income of the trust. \n \n \nSection 663(c) provides for the sole purpose of determining the amount of \ndistributable net income in the application of sections 661 and 662, in the case of a \nsingle trust having more than one beneficiary, substantially separate and independent \nshares of different beneficiaries in the trust are to be treated as separate trusts. \n \n \nSection 1.663(c)-2(a) provides that a separate share comes into existence upon \nthe earliest moment that a fiduciary may reasonably determine, based upon the known \nfacts, that a separate economic interest exists. \n \n \nSection 1.663(c)-2(b)(1) provides that the amount of distributable net income for \nany share under section 663(c) is computed as if each share constituted a separate \ntrust or estate.  Accordingly, each separate share is to calculate its distributable net \nincome based upon its portion of gross income that is includible in distributable net \nincome and its portion of any applicable deductions or losses. \n \n \nSection 1.663(c)-2(c) provides that for purposes of calculating distributable net \nincome for each separate share, the fiduciary must use a reasonable and equitable \nmethod to make the allocations, calculations, and valuations required by section \n1.663(c)-2(b). \n \n \nIn this case, the Trustee will distribute 50 percent of the assets to Daughters\u2019 \nTrust on a pro rata basis.  Therefore, based on the facts presented and the \nrepresentations made, we conclude that the distribution will not cause the Daughters\u2019 \nTrust to receive more than its allocable share of the distributable net income of the Trust \nthrough the date of funding. \n \nRuling 3 \n \n \nSection 2501 imposes a tax for each calendar year on the transfer of property by \ngift during such calendar year by any individual. \n \n  \nSection 2511(a) provides that, subject to certain limitations, the gift tax applies \nwhether the transfer is in trust or otherwise, direct or indirect, and whether the property \n \nPLR-104917-05 \n \n6 \ntransferred is real or personal, tangible or intangible. \n \n  \nSection 2512(a) provides that, if a gift is made in property, the value thereof at \nthe date of the gift will be considered the amount of the gift.  Section 2512(b), provides, \nin part, that where property is transferred for less than adequate and full consideration \nin money or money's worth, then the amount by which the value of the property \nexceeded the value of the consideration shall be deemed a gift. \n \n  \nIn Commissioner v. Estate of Bosch, 387 U.S. 456 (1967), the Supreme Court \nconsidered whether a state trial court's characterization of property rights conclusively \nbinds a federal court or agency in a federal estate tax controversy. The Court concluded \nthat the decision of a trial court as to an underlying issue of state law should not be \ncontrolling when applied to a federal statute.  Rather, the highest court of the state is the \nbest authority on the underlying substantive rule of state law to be applied in the federal \nmatter.  If there is a decision by that court, then the federal authority must apply what it \nfinds to be state law after giving \"proper regard\" to the state trial court's determination \nand to relevant rulings of other courts of the state.  In this respect, the federal agency \nmay be said, in effect, to be sitting as a state court. \n \n \nIn this case, the Construction Agreement represents a mutual understanding that \nclarifies and defines the interests that each of the beneficiaries received from Grantor at \nthe time that Grantor created Trust.  State Court's construction of Trust is consistent \nwith applicable state law that would be applied by the highest court of the state.  \nAccordingly, based on the facts submitted and representations made, we conclude that \nthe execution of the Construction Agreement, the Court\u2019s approval of the Construction \nAgreement, the Trustee\u2019s creation of the Daughters\u2019 Trust pursuant to the authority \nprovided in the Trust, and the Trustee\u2019s subsequent distribution of assets to the \nDaughters\u2019 Trust in accordance with the Construction Agreement do not constitute, or \nresult in, a taxable gift by the children of Grantor, or the Trustee, pursuant to section \n2501. \n \nIn accordance with the Power of Attorney on file with this office, copies of this \nletter are being sent to your authorized representatives. \n \n \nExcept as expressly provided herein, no opinion is expressed or implied \nconcerning the tax consequences of any aspect of any transaction or item discussed or \nreferenced in this letter. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nThe rulings contained in this letter are based upon information and \nrepresentations submitted by the taxpayer and accompanied by a penalty of perjury \nstatement executed by an appropriate party.

The sole purpose of Trust is \nto serve as the general partner and to own units of Operating Partnership.  Trust \nconducts substantially all of its operations through Operating Partnership.   \n \nOperating Partnership owns and provides real estate housing to college and university \nstudents residing off-campus, and to members of the U.S. military and their families.  \n \nPLR-165184-04 \n \n \n2 \nThe student housing properties owned by Trust are generally leased for 12 month \nintervals.  Operating Partnership also owns 100 percent of the stock of TRS, a \ncorporation that has jointly elected with Trust to be taxed as a taxable REIT subsidiary \nof Trust under section 856 (l) of the Code. \n \nIn addition to properties owned by Operating Partnership, an affiliate of Operating \nPartnership currently manages five student housing properties owned by third parties \nincluding colleges, universities and other private owners which will be contributed to \nOperating Partnership.  Operating Partnership intends to contribute these five student \nhousing management contracts to TRS, which may continue to manage properties for \nthird party owners in the future.  These student housing properties are leased to \nstudents during the school year for 9 month intervals.  During the summer, the \nproperties are leased to camp operators for varying rental periods that are generally \nless than 30 days and typically run from periods of 3 days to 2 weeks.  There will be no \ncleaning or food services provided at these properties. TRS will earn a management fee \nfor its property management services under the property management contracts with \nthird parties.  The TRS will also engage in development, construction, renovation and \nmanagement services for military housing privatization projects. \n \nAs a part of the structuring of the various entities, certain executive officers and other \nemployees of Trust who had been employed by Operating Partnership are now \nemployed by Trust.  Moreover, certain executive officers and other employees who had \nbeen employed by TRS are now employed by Trust.  Trust will enter into one or more \nreimbursement arrangements with Operating Partnership and TRS pursuant to which \nTrust will agree to share executives and other employees with Operating Partnership \nand TRS. \n \nWith respect to Operating Partnership, Trust will pay the expenses associated with the \nexecutives and other employees that are attributable to time spent by those individuals \nworking on behalf of Operating Partnership, including salaries, benefit plans, and fringe \nbenefits.  Pursuant to Operating Partnership\u2019s Partnership Agreement, the salaries and \nother costs related to the executives that are attributable to time spent by those \nexecutives in connection with the operation of Operating Partnership will be reimbursed \nby Operating Partnership.  The Partnership Agreement provides that all such \nreimbursements are treated for federal income tax purposes as expenses of Operating \nPartnership incurred on its behalf and not as expenses of Trust.   \n \nAdditionally, Trust will pay the expenses associated with the executives\u2019 and other \nemployees\u2019 time spent working on behalf of TRS, including salaries, benefit plans, and \nfringe benefits.  TRS will agree to reimburse Trust for its proportionate share of the \nexpenses associated with these individuals.  TRS will deduct as expenses its \nproportionate share of the expenses associated with the executives\u2019 time spent working \non behalf of TRS. \n \n \nPLR-165184-04 \n \n \n3 \nPursuant to the reimbursement arrangements, the amount of costs to be reimbursed will \nbe determined on an arm\u2019s length basis and will include a proportionate share of the \ncosts reasonably related to the performance of services by the executives and other \nemployees, including a proportionate share of their salaries and benefit plans.  The \nproportionate share of costs will be determined on the basis of the relative amount of \ntime such executives and other employees spend performing services for Operating \nPartnership or TRS, as applicable. \n \nTrust represents that (i) it is not in the business of providing to third parties services of \nthe type that will be covered by the reimbursement arrangements and (ii) it will not \nderive any profit from the reimbursement arrangements.   \n \n \nLAW AND ANALYSIS: \n \nSection 856(c) provides that to qualify as a REIT, a corporation must: (1) derive at least \n95 percent of its gross income (excluding gross income from prohibited transactions) \nfrom sources listed in section 856(c)(2), which includes dividends, interest, rents from \nreal property, and certain other items; and (2) derive at least 75 percent of its gross \nincome (excluding gross income from prohibited transactions) from sources listed in \nsection 856(c)(3), which includes rents from real property and certain other items.  \n \nUnder section 1.856-3(g) of the Income Tax Regulations, a REIT that is a partner in a \npartnership is deemed (1) to own its proportionate share of each of the assets of the \npartnership, and (2) to be entitled to the income of the partnership attributable to that \nshare. For purposes of section 856, the partner's interest in the partnership's assets is \ndetermined in accordance with the partner's capital interest in the partnership.   The \ncharacter of the various assets in the hands of the partnership and items of gross \nincome of the partnership retain the same character in the hands of the partners for all \npurposes of section 856. \n \nIn Rev. Rul. 84-138, 1984-2 C.B. 123, a regulated investment company (RIC) and its \nwholly-owned subsidiary shared facilities and some personnel. It was agreed that the \nRIC would pay all the expenses for general and administrative overhead, including \npersonnel costs, and the subsidiary would reimburse the RIC for its pro rata share of the \nexpenses on an arm\u2019s length basis. The ruling, in distinguishing Jergens Co. v. \nCommissioner, 40 B.T.A. 868 (1939), states that the RIC was not engaged in the \nbusiness of receiving compensation for services of the type that were reimbursed. \nInstead, reimbursements to the RIC from the subsidiary were merely repayments of \nadvances made on behalf of the subsidiary. Accordingly, the ruling holds that the \nreimbursements were not included in the RIC\u2019s gross income under section 61 of the \nCode, and, therefore, were not subject to the gross income requirement of section \n851(b)(2). \n \n \nPLR-165184-04 \n \n \n4 \nRev. Rul. 57-104, 1957-1 C.B. 166, considers whether the amount paid by a taxpayer to \nan independent contractor as reimbursement for the costs of a union negotiated \nqualified pension plan for the contractor\u2019s employees will be deductible to the taxpayer \nand included in the income of the contractor. The taxpayer, a ship owner, contracted \nwith a stevedore contractor to handle its cargoes. Pursuant to their contract, the \ntaxpayer reimbursed the contractor for the amount required to be contributed by the \ncontractor to the pension trust. The ruling holds that the amount paid by the taxpayer as \na reimbursement is part of the cost of the services rendered by the independent \ncontractor to the taxpayer, and, as such, is a deductible expense to the taxpayer under \nsection 162 of the Code. The ruling also holds that the reimbursement of amounts \ncontributed to the trust on behalf of its employees is includible in gross income by the \ncontractor under section 61 of the Code. \n \nBased on the information provided and the representations made by Trust, we conclude \nas follows: \n \nThe amounts paid to Trust by Operating Partnership and TRS as reimbursements for \ntheir allocable share of personnel and administrative overhead expenses pursuant to \nthe reimbursement arrangements, as described above, will not be considered gross \nincome to the Trust.  Consistent with this conclusion, Trust will not be entitled to a \ndeduction for the reimbursed expenses. \n  \nExcept as expressly provided herein, no opinion is expressed or implied concerning the \ntax consequences of any aspect of any transaction or item discussed or referenced in \nthis letter.  In particular, no opinion is expressed with regard to whether Trust qualifies \nas a REIT under subchapter M of the Code. Additionally, no opinion is expressed \nwhether TRS qualifies as a taxable REIT Subsidiary of Trust under section 856(l) of the \nCode.   \n \nThis ruling is directed only to the taxpayer requesting it. Section 6110(k)(3) provides that \nit may not be used or cited as precedent. \n \nIn accordance with the terms of a power of attorney on file with this office, a copy of this \nletter is being sent to your authorized representative. \n  \n                                   \nSincerely, \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWilliam E.

Decedent died on \nDate, a date that occurred in 2010.  When Decedent died, she owned an annuity \n(Annuity) that had been maintained by a commercial insurance company.  Upon her \ndeath, Decedent designated that X percent of the Annuity pass to a trust (Trust) \nestablished for the benefit of her grandchild (Grandchild).  \nThe executor of Decedent\u2019s estate timely filed Form 8939, Allocation of Increase \nin Basis for Property Acquired from a Decedent, to make the election under \u00a7 1022 and \nto allocate basis as provided by \u00a7 1022 of the Internal Revenue Code.  Executor \nattached Schedule R, Generation-Skipping Transfer Tax, to Form 8939 and allocated\nDecedent\u2019s remaining GST exemption to other trusts established under Decedent\u2019s will.  \nNone of Decedent\u2019s GST exemption was allocated to Trust.  \nPLR-112322-13\n2\nPursuant to the terms of Trust, the trustee will receive the required minimum \ndistributions for a term based on Decedent\u2019s life expectancy.  During this term, the \ntrustee of Trust is required to distribute annually the amounts paid to the trust to \nGrandchild.  The trustee may accelerate distributions at any time for Grandchild\u2019s \nhealth, education, maintenance, and support.  If Grandchild dies before the end of the \nAnnuity\u2019s distribution period, then Grandchild\u2019s issue are entitled to the remaining \ndistributions as beneficiaries of Trust.  If Grandchild dies before the end of the \ndistribution period and is not survived by issue, then Grandchild\u2019s surviving siblings \nbecome the beneficiaries of Trust.  At the end of the distribution period, Trust will \nterminate and the trustee will distribute any remaining assets outright to the current \nbeneficiaries of Trust.  \n     \nRulings Requested\n1. Trust is a skip person under \u00a7 2613(a)(2).\n2. The X percent allocable portion of Annuity passing to Trust on Date is a direct skip \nsubject to the provisions of chapter 13 as of that date.\n3. Decedent is the transferor of Annuity to Trust for purposes of chapter 13.\n4. For purposes of chapter 13, the amount of the transfer is X percent of the value of \nAnnuity determined as of Date.\n5. The GST tax resulting from the direct skip of X percent of Annuity to Trust on Date is \nthe value of the interest on Date multiplied by zero.\n6. Under \u00a7 2653(a), Trust will be treated as if the transferor were assigned to the first \ngeneration above the highest generation of any person who has an interest in Trust \nimmediately after the GST.  \n7. Periodic payments made after Date from Annuity to Trust and then from Trust to \nGrandchild while Grandchild is alive are not subject to GST tax.\nRulings 1 through 5\nSection 2601 imposes a tax on every generation-skipping transfer.  \nSection 2611(a) provides that the term \u201cgeneration-skipping transfer\u201d means a taxable \ntermination, a taxable distribution, and a direct skip. \nSection 2612(c)(1) provides that a \u201cdirect skip\u201d is a transfer subject to a tax \nimposed by chapter 11 or 12 of an interest in property to a \u201cskip person.\u201d\nPLR-112322-13\n3\nSection 2613(a)(1) provides that the term \u201cskip person\u201d means a natural person \nassigned to a generation which is 2 or more generations below the generation \nassignment of the transferor.  Section 2613(a)(2) provides that a trust is a skip person:  \n(A) if all interests in such trust are held by skip persons; or (B) if (i) there is no person \nholding an interest in such trust, and (ii) at no time after such transfer may a distribution \n(including distributions on termination) be made from such trust to a non-skip person.\nSection 26.2612-1(d)(2) of the Generation-Skipping Transfer Tax Regulations \nprovides that a trust is a skip person if:  (i) All interests in the trust are held by skip \npersons; or (ii) No person holds an interest in the trust and no distributions, other than a \ndistribution the probability of which occurring is so remote as to be negligible (including \ndistributions at the termination of the trust), may be made after the transfer to a person \nother than a skip person.  For this purpose, the probability that a distribution will occur is \nso remote as to be negligible only if it can be ascertained by actuarial standards that \nthere is less than a 5 percent probability that the distribution will occur.\nSection 2652(a)(1)(A) provides that the term \u201ctransferor\u201d means, in the case of \nany property subject to the estate tax, the decedent.\nSection 2652(c)(1) provides, in part, that a person has an interest in property \nheld in trust if (at the time the determination is made) such person:  (A) has a right \n(other than a future right) to receive income or corpus from the trust; or (B) is a \npermissible current recipient of income or corpus from the trust and is not described in  \n\u00a7 2055(a).\nSection 2602 provides that the amount of the GST tax is the taxable amount \nmultiplied by the applicable rate.  \nSection 2623 provides that the taxable amount in the case of a direct skip is the \nvalue of the property received by the transferee.\nUnder \u00a7 2624(b), in the case of any direct skip of property which is included in \nthe transferor\u2019s gross estate, the value of such property for purposes of chapter 13 is \nthe same as its value for purposes of chapter 11 (determined with regard to \u00a7\u00a7 2032 \nand 2032A).    \nSection 2641(a) defines \u201capplicable rate\u201d as the product of the maximum federal \nestate tax rate and the inclusion ratio with respect to the transfer.  Under \u00a7 2642(a)(1), \nthe inclusion ratio with respect to any property transferred in a generation-skipping \ntransfer is generally defined as the excess of 1 over the applicable fraction determined \nfor the trust from which such transfer is made or for such skip.  The \u201capplicable fraction,\u201d \nas defined in \u00a7 2642(a)(2), is a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount of GST \nexemption allocated to the trust (or to property transferred in a direct skip), and the \ndenominator of which is the value of the property transferred to the trust or involved in \nPLR-112322-13\n4\nthe direct skip reduced by the sum of any federal estate tax or state death tax actually \nrecovered from the trust attributable to such property, and any charitable deduction \nallowed under \u00a7 2055 or 2522 with respect to such property.\nSection 301(a) of the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and \nJob Creation Act of 2010, P.L. 113-312 (124 Stat. 3296) (TRUIRJCA), retroactively \nreinstated the GST tax for generation-skipping transfers that occurred during 2010.  \nNotice 2011-66, 2011-35 I.R.B. 184, \u00a7 II.A. provides that the GST tax applies to \ngeneration-skipping transfers that occur as a result of a decedent\u2019s death, regardless of \nwhether an election is made under \u00a7 1022.  Notice 2011-66, \u00a7 II.D. provides that for \npurposes of chapter 13, the Treasury Department and Internal Revenue Service will \ncontinue to construe and apply any reference to chapter 11 without regard to whether \nthe executor of the decedent\u2019s estate who died in 2010 made an election under \u00a7 1022.  \nSection 302(c) of TRUIRJCA provides that for each GST occurring during 2010, \nthe applicable rate under \u00a7 2641(a) is zero.  Notice 2011-66, \u00a7 II. A interprets this \nprovision of TRUIRJCA to mean that the maximum federal estate tax rate for purposes \nof computing the GST Tax on such a transfer is deemed to be zero, which when \nmultiplied by any inclusion ratio, will result in an applicable rate of zero.  \nIn the present case, Grandchild is two generations below Decedent and is the \nonly person who has an \u201cinterest\u201d in Trust for purposes of \u00a7 2652(c)(1)(A).  Grandchild \nis a permissible current recipient of income or corpus from Trust, and no other person \nhas any present right to receive income or corpus or is a permissible current distributee \nof income or corpus.  If Grandchild predeceases the termination of Trust, all \nremaindermen are skip persons as well.  Accordingly, since all interests, as that term is \ndefined in \u00a7 2652(c)(1)(A), in Trust are held by skip persons with respect to the \nDecedent, Trust is a skip person under \u00a7 2613(a)(2).  Therefore, based on the facts \npresented and representations made, we conclude that the X percent allocable portion \nof Annuity passing to Trust on Date is a direct skip subject to the provisions of chapter \n13 as of that date.\n  \nAnnuity is not subject to the tax under chapter 11 because Decedent\u2019s executor \nmade an election under \u00a7 1022.  Under Notice 2011-66, any reference to chapter 11 \nunder chapter 13 applies as if the decedent was subject to chapter 11 even if the \ndecedent\u2019s executor made an election under \u00a7 1022.  If the executor of Decedent\u2019s \nestate had not made the election under \u00a7 1022, the value of the Annuity would have \nbeen included in Decedent\u2019s gross estate for federal estate tax purposes.  Accordingly, \nDecedent is considered the transferor of X percent of Annuity under \u00a7 2652(a)(1)(A). \nPursuant to \u00a7 2623 and 2624(b), the taxable amount of the direct skip is the \nvalue of X percent of the Annuity that would have been included in Decedent\u2019s estate on \nDate.  The executor of Decedent\u2019s estate did not allocate any of Decedent\u2019s              \nGST exemption to the direct skip.  Thus, the applicable fraction for purposes of chapter \nPLR-112322-13\n5\n13 is 1.  However, under Notice 2011-66 and TRUIRJCA, the maximum federal estate \ntax rate for purposes of chapter 13 is deemed to be zero.  Accordingly, the GST tax on \nthe direct skip is zero.                \nBased on the facts presented and representations made, we conclude that the \ntransfer of Annuity  from Decedent to Trust is a direct skip that occurred on Date.  \nDecedent is the transferor of X percent of Annuity for purposes of chapter 13.  \nFurthermore, the value of the direct skip is the value of X percent of Annuity on Date, \nand the GST tax on the direct skip is zero.  See \u00a7 2624(b).\nRulings 6 and 7 \nSection 2653(a) provides that if:  (1) there is a generation-skipping transfer of any \nproperty; and (2) immediately after such transfer such property is held in trust, for \npurposes of applying chapter 13 (other than \u00a7 2651) to subsequent transfers from the \nportion of the trust attributable to such property, the trust will be treated as if the \ntransferor of such property were assigned to the first generation above the highest \ngeneration of any person who has an interest in such trust immediately after the \ntransfer.\nIn \u00a7 26.2653-1(b), Example 1, T transfers property to an irrevocable trust for the \nbenefit of T\u2019s grandchild, GC, and great-grandchild, GGC.  During GC\u2019s life, the trustee \nhas discretion to distribute the trust income to GC and GGC.  At GC\u2019s death, the trust \nproperty passes to GGC.  The example explains that both GC and GGC have an \ninterest in the trust for purposes of chapter 13.  The transfer by T to the trust is a direct \nskip, and the property is held in trust immediately after the transfer.  After the direct skip, \nthe transferor is treated as being one generation above GC, the highest generation \nindividual having an interest in the trust.  The example concludes that GC is no longer a \nskip person and distributions to GC are not taxable distributions.  However, because \nGGC occupies a generation that is two generations below the deemed generation of T, \nGGC is a skip person and distributions of trust income to GGC are taxable distributions.\nAs stated above, the transfer of X percent Annuity to Trust as a result of \nDecedent\u2019s death was a direct skip on Date.  Based on the facts presented and \nrepresentations made, under \u00a7 2653(a), Trust is treated as if the Decedent was \nassigned to the first generation above the highest generation of any person who has an \ninterest in Trust immediately after the GST.  Thus, we conclude that periodic \ndistributions made after Date from Annuity to Trust and then from Trust to Grandchild \nwhile Grandchild is alive are not subject to GST tax.\nFurthermore, except as expressly provided herein, no opinion is expressed or \nimplied concerning the tax consequences of any aspect of any transaction or item \ndiscussed or referenced in this letter.  \nPLR-112322-13\n6\nThis ruling is directed only to the taxpayer requesting it.

Husband transferred cash to Trust\nand the trustees applied for second-to-die term policies on the lives of Husband and\n-2-\nSpouse. Trust holds two life insurance policies, each insuring the joint lives of Husband\nand Spouse. Trust has owned the two second-to-die policies at all times since they\nwere  purchased and the policies are the only assets held by Trust.  F, G, and H are the\ntrustees of Trust.\nUnder Article Fifth of Trust, the trustee is vested with all right, title and interest in\nany insurance policies that are transferred to Trust, and is authorized and empowered\nto exercise and enjoy, for the purposes of Trust and as absolute owner of the insurance\npolicies, all the options, benefits, rights and privileges under the insurance policies. \nTrust also provides that Husband relinquishes all rights and powers in the insurance\npolicies which are not assignable and will, at the request of the trustee, execute all\nother instruments reasonably required to effectuate this relinquishment.\nUnder Article Third of Trust, during Husband\u2019s life, immediately following any\ncontribution to Trust, Spouse has the right, for 60 days, to demand and withdraw the full\namount of the contribution, except that the total withdrawals by Spouse in any calendar\nyear cannot exceed five thousand dollars.  If Spouse withdraws an amount less than\nfive thousand dollars, F, G, and H have the right to withdraw a proportionate share of\nany contribution to Trust that Spouse has not withdrawn.  \nArticle Fourth provides that during Husband\u2019s life, the trustee may, but is not\nrequired to, use net income and principal of Trust to pay premiums on the policies of life\ninsurance on the lives of Husband and Spouse.  After paying any insurance premiums,\nthe trustee may pay to or apply for the benefit of Spouse, F, G, and H so much of the\nnet income and principal of Trust as the trustee deems appropriate.   However, the\ntrustee may not distribute or apply Trust income or principal to discharge a legal support\nobligation of Husband. \nUnder Article Sixth, if Spouse survives Husband,  the trustee is to pay all of the\nnet income of Trust to Spouse, at convenient intervals, but at least quarter-annually, for\nSpouse\u2019s lifetime.  The trustee is authorized to distribute principal of Trust, even to the\nexhaustion thereof, in the sole discretion of the trustee, if the net income together with\nincome from other sources known to the trustee available to Spouse, F, G, and H is\ninsufficient.   Net income is insufficient if it is less than the amount needed to:            \n(a) provide for proper health, support, education and maintenance; (b) meeting any\nemergency such as medical, dental, surgical care, or hospitalization; or (c) maintaining\nor permitting a standard of living approximately the same as was enjoyed during\nHusband\u2019s lifetime.\nIf the proceeds of any life insurance policies on Husband\u2019s life are includible in\nHusband\u2019s gross estate, Spouse will have the power to demand distribution of all such\nproceeds and the income therefrom, at all times, alone and in all events. \nUpon Spouse\u2019s death, if Spouse survives Husband, the trustee is to divide the\nremaining Trust property in equal shares, one such share for each of the then living\nchildren of Husband and Spouse.  If any of F, G, and H have predeceased Husband or\nSpouse, as the case may be, the share of the deceased child is to be divided further\n-3-\ninto separate equal shares for such child\u2019s issue.  If a deceased child\u2019s issue is under\nthe age of thirty-five (35), such issue\u2019s share is to be held in further trust.\nUpon the death or resignation of a co-trustee, the remaining co-trustees are to\ncontinue to serve.  Trust contains no provision for the appointment of additional\ntrustees.  There is also no express prohibition against Spouse serving as a trustee.\nHusband died on Date 2, in 1996, survived by Spouse.   \nIt is represented that the scrivener of Trust incorrectly drafted the trust instrument\nas one that was intended to be funded with single-life insurance policies rather than\npolicies on joint lives.  It is also represented that upon creating Trust, Husband did not\nintend that Spouse would have any beneficial interests in Trust that would cause\ninclusion of life insurance proceeds in Spouse\u2019s gross estate.\nOn Date 3, also in 1996, Spouse executed a disclaimer of her right to satisfy the\n$5,000 annual withdrawal power with a pro-rata portion of the life insurance policies\nheld by Trust if other assets were unavailable to satisfy Spouse\u2019s demand right.  \nOn Date 4, the trustee of Trust filed a petition with the appropriate Probate Court\nseeking the reformation of Trust.  On Date 5, in 1996, the court entered its Order\nreforming Trust as follows:\n1.  Spouse\u2019s right to withdraw the first five thousand dollars\ncontributed to Trust  annually was eliminated;\n2.  Spouse\u2019s right to receive income and principal from\nTrust, both before and after the death of Husband was\neliminated.\n It is represented that the reformation is binding upon and enforceable against\nSpouse under State law.  It is also represented that Spouse has never received a\ndistribution of income or principal from Trust.  It is also represented that Spouse has\nmade contributions to Trust since the death of Husband, and continues to make such\ncontributions,  to cover the cost of the premium payments on the life insurance policies.\nYou have requested a ruling that upon the death of Spouse, no part of the assets\nof Trust, including the proceeds of the life insurance policies on the joint lives of\nHusband and Spouse, will be includible in Spouse\u2019s gross estate under \u00a7\u00a7 2036, 2038,\nand 2042.\nSection 2001 imposes a tax on the taxable estate of every decedent who is a\ncitizen or resident of the United States.\nSection 2033 provides that the value of the gross estate shall include the value\nof all property to the extent of the interest therein of the decedent at the time of the\ndecedent\u2019s death.\n-4-\nSection 2035(a) provides that if the decedent made a transfer (by trust or\notherwise) of an interest in any property, or relinquished a power with respect to any\nproperty, during the 3-year period ending on the date of the decedent\u2019s death, and the\nvalue of such property (or an interest therein) would have been included in the\ndecedent\u2019s gross estate under section 2036, 2037, 2038, or 2042 if such transferred\ninterest or relinquished power had been retained by the decedent on the date of his\ndeath, the value of the gross estate shall include the value of any property (or interest\ntherein) which would have been so included.\nSection 2036(a) provides that the value of the gross estate shall include the\nvalue of all property to the extent of any interest therein of which the decedent has at\nany time made a transfer (except in the case of a bona fide sale for an adequate and\nfull consideration in money or money\u2019s worth), by trust or otherwise, under which he has\nretained for his life or for any period not ascertainable without reference to his death or\nfor any period which does not in fact end before his death, (1) the possession or\nenjoyment of, or the right to the income from, the property, or (2) the right, either alone\nor in conjunction with any person, to designate the persons who shall possess or enjoy\nthe property or the income from the property.\nSection 2038(a)(1) provides that the value of the gross estate shall include the\nvalue of all property to the extent of any interest therein of which the decedent has at\nany time made a transfer (except in case of a bona fide sale for adequate and full\nconsideration in money or money\u2019s worth), by trust or otherwise, where the enjoyment\nthereof was subject at the date of his death to any change through the exercise of a\npower, either by the decedent alone or in conjunction with any person, to alter, amend,\nor revoke, or  where the decedent relinquished any such power during the 3-year period\nending on the date of the decedent\u2019s death.\nSection 2042(1) provides that the value of the gross estate shall include the\nvalue of all property to the extent of the amount receivable by the executor as insurance\nunder policies on the life of the decedent.  Section 2042(2), provides that the gross\nestate includes the proceeds of any life insurance policies insuring the decedent's life\nreceivable by beneficiaries other than the decedent\u2019s executor with respect to which the\ndecedent possessed incidents of ownership at the time of his death.\nSection 20.2042-1(b) of the Estate Tax Regulations provides as follows,\nregarding the application of \u00a7 2042(1): \nSection 2042 requires the inclusion in the gross estate of the\nproceeds of insurance on the decedent\u2019s life receivable by\nthe executor or administrator, or payable to the decedent\u2019s\nestate.  It makes no difference whether or not the estate is\nspecifically named as the beneficiary under the terms of the\npolicy.  Thus, if under the terms of an insurance policy the\nproceeds are receivable by another beneficiary but are\nsubject to an obligation, legally binding upon the other\nbeneficiary, to pay taxes, debts, or other charges\n-5-\nenforceable against the estate, then the amount of such\nproceeds required for the payment in full (to the extent of the\nbeneficiary\u2019s obligation) of such taxes, debts, or other\ncharges is includible in the gross estate. \nRegarding the application of \u00a7 2042(2), \u00a7 20.2042-1(c)(2) provides that the term\n\u201cincidents of ownership\u201d is not limited in its meaning to ownership of a policy in the\ntechnical legal sense. Generally speaking, the term has reference to the right of the\ninsured or his estate to the economic benefits of the policy.  Thus, it includes the power\nto change the beneficiary, to surrender or cancel the policy, to assign the policy, to\nrevoke an assignment, to pledge the policy for a loan, or to obtain from the insurer a\nloan against the surrender value of the policy. \nSection 20.2042-1(c)(4) provides that a decedent is considered to have an\nincident of ownership in an insurance policy on his life held in trust if, under the terms of\nthe policy, the decedent, either alone or in conjunction with another person or persons,\nhas the power, as trustee or otherwise, to change the beneficial ownership of the policy\nor its proceeds or the time and manner of enjoyment thereof, even though the decedent\nhas no beneficial interest in the trust.\nUnder \u00a7 2514(b), the exercise or release of a general power of appointment\ncreated after October 21, 1942, is deemed to be a transfer of property by the individual\npossessing the power.  Section 2514(e) provides that the lapse of a power of\nappointment created after October 21, 1942, during the life of the individual possessing\nthe power shall be considered a release of such power.  This rule applies with respect\nto the lapse of powers during any calendar year only to the extent that the property\nwhich could have been appointed by exercise of such lapsed powers exceeds in value\nthe greater of: (1) $5,000, or (2) 5 percent of the aggregate value of the assets out of\nwhich, the exercise of lapsed powers could be satisfied.\nIn the present case, Husband established Trust on Date 1 and made all the\ntransfers to Trust up to the date of his death.  Spouse has made no direct or indirect\ncontributions to Trust by reason of the lapse of Spouse\u2019s withdrawal right since, Spouse\ncould not withdraw more than $5,000 in any calendar year.  Spouse, has however,\nmade transfers since the death of Husband, to Trust for the payment of premiums on\nthe life insurance policies held by Trust.  In 1996, as a result of Spouse\u2019s disclaimer and\nthe trust modification, Spouse\u2019s interest in Trust was extinguished.  The court order\nmodifying the trust is controlling for tax purposes for periods after the date of the order. \nSee Rev. Rul. 73-142, 1973-1 C.B. 405.  Although Spouse continues to make transfers\nto Trust for the payment of premiums, Spouse retains no interest in Trust.  Thus,\nSpouse\u2019s interest in Trust has been extinguished and more than three years have\nelapsed since Spouse\u2019s interests were extinguished.  Accordingly, assuming that\nSpouse will not serve as a trustee of Trust, we conclude that the Trust property will not\nbe includible in the gross estate of Spouse under \u00a7\u00a7 2035, 2036 and 2038.  See Rev.\nRul. 73-142, supra. \n-6-\nFurther, the policy proceeds are not payable to Spouse\u2019s estate, nor are the\nproceeds subject to any legally binding obligation to be used to pay taxes, debts, or\nother charges enforceable against the Spouse\u2019s estate.  In addition, Spouse does not\ncurrently possess any incidents of ownership in the insurance policies held by Trust. \nAccordingly, we conclude that, assuming Spouse does not become trustee of Trust,\nupon Spouse\u2019s death, no part of the life insurance proceeds payable with respect to the\npolicies on the joint lives of Husband and Spouse, will be includible in Spouse\u2019s gross\nestate under \u00a7\u00a7 2042(1) or (2).\nExcept as ruled above, we express or imply no opinion  concerning the federal\ntax consequences of this transaction under the cited provisions of the Code or any\nother provision of the Code.  We are specifically expressing no opinion regarding the\ngift tax consequences with respect to the reformation of the Trust on Date 5. \nIn accordance with the power of attorney on file with this office, we are sending a\ncopy of this letter to your authorized representative.  \nThis ruling is directed only to the taxpayer who requested it.

Department, a political subdivision, \nwas created over a years ago by the State legislature pursuant to State statute as an \nindependent department of City free from political influence from the Mayor of City or \nthe City-County Council.  Department is a broad-based utility that serves more than b\ncustomers and manages a growing utility services business.  Exclusive management \nand control of Department is vested in its c-member board of directors (the \u201cDepartment \nBoard\u201d).\nMembers of the Department Board must be residents of City and are appointed \nannually by the Trustees, a d-member board of trustees with no oversight by City.  The \ninitial Trustees were appointed by the City Mayor, the City-County Council, and the \nCounty Circuit Court judge with varying initial terms.  Thereafter, the Trustees have \nserved staggered terms of four years.  Upon expiration of a Trustee\u2019s term (or if a \nTrustee dies, resigns, becomes a nonresident of City or is otherwise removed), the \nremaining Trustees nominate a successor, who is appointed by the City Mayor within 10 \ndays.  A Trustee may be removed from office only for cause, and only by an order and \njudgment following the filing of a complaint by City in the local circuit or superior courts.  \nThe Trustees may remove summarily and at any time any member of the Department \nBoard.  City has no power to remove a member of the Department Board.\nDepartment Board is granted the power to adopt rules for service and rates for service \nin connection with the furnishing of service to its customers, subject to State approval.  \nDepartment Board has exclusive authority over expenditure of its funds.  While \nDepartment Board is required to make certain accounting and other reports to the City \ncontroller, the books, accounts, records and transactions of Department and of \nPLR-132892-10\n3\nDepartment Board are only subject to examination, audit, and supervision by the State \nBoard of Accounts to the same extent as other municipal governments or departments \nof municipal governments.\nDepartment is granted the power of eminent domain by State statute.  Department may \nact to condemn and hold any real estate within the City or within five miles of the \ncorporate limits of the City needed for the proper giving of service.  There are no \nconditions or restrictions on Department\u2019s exercise of its power of eminent domain other \nthan those imposed on all government entities exercising eminent domain in State.  \nDepartment is not required to seek approval from or act through City or State to \nexercise its power of eminent domain.  Title to any property so acquired remains with \nDepartment.\nDepartment is also granted by State statute the power to levy a special tax upon all \nproperty within the corporate limits of City for the purpose of raising money to pay the \nprincipal of and interest accruing on bonds issued by Department.\nDepartment has exclusive authority under State statute to issue utility district bonds in \nthe name of City, and may issue such bonds without City\u2019s authorization.  These bonds \nare an indebtedness of Department as a special taxing district and are not an obligation \nor indebtedness of City.\nCity and District own and operate the System.  District was established under City\u2019s \nmunicipal code.  City has the power to appoint and remove the members of District\u2019s \nboard of directors.\nDistrict has financed a portion of the System with revenue bonds (the \u201cDistrict Bonds\u201d) \nwhich were authorized by resolution of City and were issued by the District in the name \nof the City.  The District Bonds are payable from the revenues of the operation of the \nSystem.\nDepartment, City, and District have entered into an agreement (the \u201cAgreement\u201d) \npursuant to State\u2019s interlocal cooperation statute, to form Authority, a non-profit \ncorporation, to acquire and operate the System. The Agreement provides that Authority \nwill possess all of the \u201cappropriate and requisite authorizations, powers, functions and \nduties\u201d of the three creating entities to allow it to administer and operate the \nSystem.  City and District will vest in Authority all of their respective powers and \nauthority related to the operation of the System (other than their powers of taxation).  \nDepartment will transfer all of its relevant powers to Authority, including its eminent \ndomain, taxing, and regulatory powers, and the Department Board is charged under the \nAgreement to use such powers as the board of directors of Authority.  Authority will be \nauthorized to exercise eminent domain powers on its own, without Department\u2019s \napproval.\nPLR-132892-10\n4\nWhile Authority will own the System as a separate entity, the Agreement requires that \nAuthority be wholly controlled by, and the System solely operated by, Department.  The \nDepartment Board will serve as the board of directors of Authority and will have \nresponsibility for Authority\u2019s budget.  Department\u2019s treasurer is responsible to receive, \ndisburse, and account for all monies of Authority which are required to be segregated \nfrom those of any other utility.  Upon dissolution of Authority and after all liabilities of \nAuthority have been paid, all assets of Authority will be distributed to Department or \nsuch other entity as Department shall determine to be operating for the benefit of the \ninhabitants of City.\nAfter Authority was created, and the Department (and Authority) Board adopted an \napproving resolution, Department and Authority entered into an asset purchase \nagreement (the \u201cPurchase Agreement\u201d) with City and District for the acquisition of the \nSystem assets to be held by Authority.  Authority will issue bonds (the \u201cAuthority \nBonds\u201d) to pay at least a portion of the purchase price.\nLaw and Analysis\nPolitical Subdivision\nSection 103(a) provides generally that gross income does not include interest on any \nState or local bond.\nSection 1.103-1(a) provides, in part, that interest upon obligations of a state, territory, \npossession of the United States, the District of Columbia, or any political subdivision \nthereof (hereinafter collectively or individually called \u201cstate or local government unit\u201d) is \nnot includable in gross income.\nSection 1.103-1(b) provides that the term \u201cpolitical subdivision\u201d denotes any division of \nany state or local governmental unit that is a municipal corporation or that has been \ndelegated the right to exercise part of the sovereign power of the unit.  As thus defined, \na political subdivision of any state or local governmental unit may or may not, for \npurposes of this section, include special assessment districts so created, such as road, \nwater, sewer, gas, light, reclamation, drainage, irrigation, levee, school, harbor, port \nimprovement, and similar districts and divisions of these units.\nThree generally acknowledged sovereign powers of states are the power to tax, the \npower of eminent domain, and the police power.  Commissioner of Estate of Alexander \nv. Shamberg, 3 T.C. 131 (1944), acq., 1945 C.B. 6, aff\u2019d 144 F.2d 998 (2d Cir. 1944), \ncert denied, 323 U.S. 792 (1945).  It is not necessary that all three of these powers be \ndelegated in order to treat an entity as a political subdivision for purposes of the Code.  \nHowever, possession of only an insubstantial amount of any or all of the sovereign \npowers is not sufficient.  All of the facts and circumstances must be taken into \nPLR-132892-10\n5\nconsideration, including the public purposes of the entity and its control by a \ngovernment.  Rev. Rul. 77-164, 1977-1 C.B. 20.\nConsideration of these principles as they apply to the facts of this case, leads us to \nconclude that Authority is a political subdivision for purposes of \u00a7 1.103-1(b).  Authority \nwill be wholly controlled by Department, a political subdivision.  The Department Board \nwill serve as the board of directors of Authority.  Department is responsible for receiving, \ndisbursing, and accounting for all monies of Authority.  Upon dissolution of Authority all \nremaining assets of Authority will be distributed to Department or such other entity \noperating for the benefit of the inhabitants of City as Department shall designate.\nDepartment will transfer its powers to Authority, including its eminent domain, taxing, \nand regulatory powers, and the Department Board is charged under the Agreement to \nuse such powers as the board of directors of Authority.  Department\u2019s power of eminent \ndomain allows it to condemn and hold any real estate within the City or within five miles \nof the corporate limits of the City needed for the proper giving of service.  Department is \nnot required to seek approval from or act through City or State to exercise its power of \neminent domain.  Authority will be authorized to exercise eminent domain powers on its \nown, without Department\u2019s approval.\nAuthority\u2019s purpose of operating the System is a wholly public purpose.\nRelated Party\nUnder \u00a7 1.150-1(a)(1), except as otherwise provided, the definitions in \u00a7 1.150-1 apply \nfor all purposes of \u00a7\u00a7 103 and 141 through 150.  Section 1.150-1(b) provides, in part, \nthat \u201crelated party\u201d means, in reference to a governmental unit or a 501(c)(3) \norganization any member of the same controlled group.\nA \u201ccontrolled group\u201d is defined in \u00a7 1.150-1(e) as a group of entities controlled directly or \nindirectly by the same entity or group of entities.  Section 1.150-1(e)(1) provides that the \ndetermination of direct control is made on the basis of all the facts and circumstances.  \nOne entity or group of entities (the controlling entity) generally controls another entity or \ngroup of entities (the controlled entity) if the controlling entity possesses either of the \nfollowing rights or powers and the rights or powers are discretionary and non-ministerial \n\u2013 (i) the right or power both to approve and to remove without cause a controlling \nportion of the governing body of the controlled entity; or (ii) the right or power to require \nthe use of funds or assets of the controlled entity for any purpose of the controlling \nentity.\nSection 1.150-1(e)(2) states that if a controlling entity controls a controlled entity under \nthis test, then the controlling entity also controls all entities controlled, directly or \nindirectly, by the controlled entity or entities.\nPLR-132892-10\n6\nAn entity is not a controlled entity under \u00a7 1.150-1(e)(3) if the entity possesses \nsubstantial taxing, eminent domain, and police powers. For example, a city possessing \nsubstantial amounts of each of these sovereign powers is not a controlled entity of the \nstate.\nThe issue is whether Authority is related to City or District.  Section 1.150-1(e)(3), which \nprovides an entity is not a \u201ccontrolled entity\u201d if it possesses substantial taxing, eminent \ndomain, and police powers, is not applicable in this case, because Authority does not \npossess substantial amounts of all three sovereign powers.  Thus, in order to determine \nwhether Authority is controlled by City or District under \u00a7 1.150-1(e), we must examine \nall the relevant facts and circumstances.\nAuthority has been created as a separate entity wholly controlled by and solely operated \nby Department.  Department Board serves as Authority\u2019s board of directors and is \nresponsible for its budget.  Neither City nor District has the power to appoint, remove, or \nto cause the removal of, a member of the Department Board.  Neither City nor District \nhas the power to appoint any Trustee. Trustees may be removed from office only for \ncause, and only by an order and judgment from a circuit or superior court.  In addition, \nneither City nor District has control over Department Board\u2019s ability to set rules and \nrates.  Department Board is granted the power to adopt rules for service and rates for \nservice, subject only to State approval. While Department Board is required to make \ncertain accounting and other reports to the City controller, the books, accounts, records \nand transactions of Department and of Department Board are only subject to \nexamination, audit, and supervision by the State Board of Accounts.  Neither City nor \nDistrict has the right to use the funds or assets of Department or Authority.  Accordingly, \nbased on all the relevant circumstances, neither Department nor Authority is controlled \nwithin the meaning of \u00a7 1.150-1(e) by either City or District.  As neither City nor District \ncontrols Department or Authority, Authority is not a member of City\u2019s or District\u2019s \ncontrolled group. Therefore, Authority will not be a related party as described in \u00a7 1.150-\n1(b) to either City or District.\nConclusions\nBased on the information submitted and representations made, we conclude that\n(1) Authority qualifies as a political subdivision for purposes of \u00a7 103, and (2) Authority \nis not a related party to either City or District under \u00a7 1.150-1(b).\nExcept as expressly provided herein, no opinion is expressed or implied concerning the \ntax consequences of any transaction or item discussed or referenced in this letter.\nThis ruling is directed only to the taxpayer who requested it.  Section 6110(k)(3) \nprovides that it may not be used or cited as precedent.\nPLR-132892-10\n7\nIn accordance with a Power of Attorney on file with this office, a copy of this letter is \nbeing sent to the authorized representatives of Department.\nThe ruling contained in this letter is based upon information and representations \nsubmitted by Department and accompanied by a penalty of perjury statement executed \nby an appropriate party.

While this office has not verified any of \nthe material submitted in support of the request for rulings, it is subject to verification on \nexamination. \n \n \nThis letter is in response to a letter of Date 4, submitted by the taxpayer, \nrequesting a ruling under section 301.9100-3 of the Procedure and Administrative \nRegulations requesting relief to make a timely election under section 461(c) of the \nInternal Revenue Code.  The facts are as follows: \n \n \nTaxpayer is an accrual basis limited liability company.  The taxpayer was formed \nin Date 1 and filed its first tax returns on Date 3.  The taxpayer intended to elect under \nsection 461(c) of the Internal Revenue Code to ratably accrue real estate taxes.  This \nelection may be made without the consent of the secretary of the Treasury provided it is  \n \nPLR-165129-04 \n \n2 \nmade no later than the due date (including extensions) of the return for the first taxable \nyear in which the taxpayer incurs real property taxes.   \n \n \nThe Accounting Firm was hired to prepare the tax returns for taxpayer\u2019s first tax \nyear.  The Accounting Firm properly filed Form 8736 to automatically extend the section \n461(c) election deadline until Date 2.   They filed Form 8800 to again extend their filing \ndate to Date 5.  They failed to include an explanation of the need for a second extension \nin preparation of Form 8800.  As a result, the Internal Revenue Service denied the \ntaxpayer\u2019s request for an extension.  The failure to include an explanation of the need \nfor a second extension has made the election to ratably accrue real estate taxes \nunavailable to the taxpayer.  The taxpayer\u2019s first tax return for the taxpayer\u2019s first tax \nyear was filed on Date 3.   \n \n \nSections 301.9100-1 through 301.9100-3 of the regulations provide extensions of \ntime to make a regulatory election.  Section 301.9100-2 provides an automatic 6 month \nextension of time to make a regulatory election, predicated upon the taxpayer\u2019s timely \nfiling of their tax return for the relevant tax year.  Section 301.9100-3 provides \nextensions of time for making regulatory elections that do not meet the requirements of \nsection 301.9100-2.  Section 301.9100-3(a) provides that a request for relief under \nsection 301.9100-3 will be granted when the taxpayer provides evidence to establish to \nthe satisfaction of the Commissioner that the taxpayer acted reasonably and in good \nfaith, and the grant of relief will not prejudice the interests of the government. \n \n \nSection 301.9100-3(b)(1)(v) of the regulations provides in part that a taxpayer is \ndeemed to have acted reasonably and in good faith if the taxpayer relied on a qualified \ntax professional, and the tax professional failed to make the election.  Section \n301.9100-3(b)(2) of the regulations provides that there is no reasonable reliance if the \ntaxpayer knew or should have known that the professional was not competent to render \nadvice on the regulatory election or was not aware of all relevant facts. \n \n \nSection 301.9100-3(b)(3) of the regulations provides in part that a taxpayer is \ndeemed to have not acted reasonably and in good faith if the taxpayer: \ni) \nSeeks to alter a return position for which an accuracy-related penalty has \nbeen or could be imposed under section 6662 at the time the taxpayer \nrequests relief; \nii) \nWas informed in all material respects of the required election and related \ntax consequences but chose not to file the election; or \niii) \nUses hindsight in requesting relief.  If specific facts have changed since \nthe due date for making the election that make the election advantageous \nto a taxpayer, the IRS will not ordinarily grant relief.  In such a case, the \nIRS will grant relief only when the taxpayer provides strong proof that the \ntaxpayer\u2019s decision to seek relief did not involve hindsight. \n \n \nSection 301.9100-3(c) of the regulations provides in part that the interests of the \ngovernment are prejudiced if granting relief would result in the taxpayer having a lower \n \nPLR-165129-04 \n \n3 \ntax liability in the aggregate, for all taxable years affected by the election, than the \ntaxpayer would have had if the election had been timely made (taking into account the \ntime value of money).  This section also provides that the interests of the government \nare prejudiced if the taxable year in which the regulatory election should have been \nmade or any taxable years that would have been affected by the election had it been \ntimely made are closed by the period of limitations on assessments under section \n6501(a) before the taxpayer\u2019s receipt of a ruling granting relief under this section. \n \n \nBased upon our analysis of the facts, the taxpayer in the instant case acted \nreasonably and in good faith, and granting relief will not prejudice the interests of the \ngovernment, and therefore the requirements of section 301.9100 have been met. \n \n \nUnder the facts represented, the taxpayer\u2019s failure to include an explanation for \nthe need for a second extension on the Form 8800 was not due to the intentional \ndisregard of the tax rules, but due to a reasonable reliance upon a qualified tax \nprofessional.  Thus, the failure to include an explanation was an inadvertent error on the \npart of the taxpayer, and the taxpayer did not affirmatively choose not to file the return.  \nThe taxpayer is not seeking to alter a return position or to use hindsight to request relief.  \nFinally, the taxpayer acted promptly in filing its request for relief, before the IRS \ndiscovered the failure to make a regulatory election.  Therefore, the taxpayer did not act \nunreasonably or in bad faith. \n \n \nFurthermore, granting relief will not result in the taxpayer having a lower tax \nliability in the aggregate for all taxable years affected by the election than the taxpayer \nwould have had if the election had  been timely made, nor will any closed years be \naffected, as the taxpayer has filed its return as if the election had been timely made.  \nTherefore, the interests of the government will not be prejudiced by granting the request \nfor relief. \n \n \nBecause the taxpayer acted reasonably and in good faith, and because the \ninterests of the government will not be prejudiced if the request for relief is granted, \ntaxpayer is granted an extension of 45 days from the date of this ruling to file the forms \nnecessary to ratably accrue real estate property taxes under section 461(c) of the Code. \n \n \nThis ruling is directed only to the taxpayer requesting it.

Article Second, Paragraph 1, of Trust provides the trustees with the authority\nto distribute the net income of Trust to Son and his living issue.  Paragraph 1 also\nprovides the trustees with the discretion to distribute principal from Trust to Son and his\nliving issue for their comfortable maintenance, support, health, education and well-\nbeing.\nArticle Second, Paragraph 2, of Trust provides Son with a testamentary power of\nappointment and states as follows:\n2. Special Power of Appointment.  Upon the death of the survivor of\n[Son] and his issue or, twenty-one (21) years after the death of the\nsurvivor of [Son], his sister [Sister] and his son [Grandson], whichever\nshall first occur, the trustees shall pay over the then remaining principal\n2\nand undistributed income, free and clear of any trust, in such amounts\nand  proportions as [Son] shall appoint to or among any one or more of\n[Grantors\u2019] issue and the spouse of issue by a Will referring specifically to\nthe power herein given to him.  If or to the extent [Son] does not exercise\nthe power of appointment given by the preceding sentence, the Trustees\nshall hold and dispose of the remaining principal and undistributed income\nin accordance with the terms of the following paragraph of this Article\nSECOND.\nSon has requested a ruling that the testamentary power of appointment over\nTrust is not a general power of appointment within the meaning of \u00a7 2041(b)(1), and\ntherefore, the existence, exercise, failure to exercise, or partial or complete release of\nthe power of appointment will not cause the value of the property in Trust to be included\nin Son\u2019s gross estate under \u00a7 2041(a).\nSection 2041(a)(2) provides that the value of the gross estate includes the value\nof all property with respect to which the decedent has at the time of his death a general\npower of appointment created after October 21, 1942, or with respect to which the\ndecedent has at any time exercised or released such a power of appointment by a\ndisposition which is of such nature that if it were a transfer of property owned by the\ndecedent, the property would be includible in the decedent's gross estate under \n\u00a7\u00a7 2035 to 2038, inclusive.  For purposes of \u00a7 2041(a)(2), the power of appointment is\nconsidered to exist on the date of the decedent's death even though the exercise of the\npower is subject to a precedent giving of notice or even though the exercise of the\npower takes effect only on the expiration of a stated period after its exercise, whether or\nnot on or before the date of the decedent's death notice has been given or the power\nhas been exercised.\nSection 2041(b)(1) provides, with exceptions not relevant here, that the term\n\"general power of appointment\" means a power that is exercisable in favor of the\ndecedent, his estate, his creditors, or the creditors of his estate.\nSection 20.2041-1(c)(1) of the Estate Tax Regulations provides that the term\n\"general power of appointment\" as defined in \u00a7 2041(b)(1) means any power of\nappointment exercisable in favor of the decedent, his estate, his creditors, or the\ncreditors of his estate.  Section 20.2041-1(c)(1)(a) provides that a power of appointment\nis not a general power if by its terms it is exercisable only in favor of one or more\ndesignated persons or classes other than the decedent or his creditors, or the\ndecedent's estate or the creditors of his estate.\nIn this case, Son may appoint by will to the class consisting of Grantor\u2019s issue and\nthe spouses of such issue.  Because Son's power of appointment is a testamentary\npower, Son may not appoint any part of the trust to Son or to Son's creditors during\nSon's life.  In addition, based on the terms of the trust instrument, the reference to\n3\n\u201c[Grantor\u2019s] issue\u201d as a permissible class of appointees of Son\u2019s testamentary power is\nproperly viewed as not including Son\u2019s estate or Son\u2019s creditors after Son\u2019s death.\nAccordingly, based on the information submitted and the representations made, we\nconclude: (1) Son's testamentary power of appointment over the principal of the Trust\ndoes not constitute a general power of appointment within the meaning of \u00a7 2041(b)(1);\nand (2) the existence, exercise, failure to fully exercise, or partial or complete release of\nSon's power to appoint the principal of the Trust will not cause the value of the property\nin the Trust to be included in Son's taxable estate.\nThis ruling is directed only to the taxpayer(s) requesting it.  Section 6110(j)(3) of the\nCode provides that it may not be used or cited as precedent.\nIn accordance with the Power of Attorney on file with this office, a copy of this letter\nis being sent to the taxpayer.\nThe rulings contained in this letter are based upon information and representations\nsubmitted by the taxpayer and accompanied by a penalty of perjury statement executed\nby an appropriate party.

Additional information was submitted in a letter dated September 29,\n1998.  The information submitted for consideration is substantially as set forth below.\nThe ruling contained in this letter is based upon information and representations\nsubmitted by the taxpayer and accompanied by penalty of perjury statements executed\nby an appropriate party.  While this office has not verified any of the material submitted\nin support of the request for rulings, it is subject to verification on examination.\nA was born in Country B in Year 1.  In Year 2, A was transferred by his employer\nto the United States and obtained his green card soon thereafter.  In Year 3, A was\ntransferred back to Country B.  A surrendered his green card on Date C.  On the date of\nA\u2019s expatriation, his net worth exceeded the amount set forth in section 877(a)(2). \nSection 877 generally provides that a citizen who loses U.S. citizenship or a U.S.\nlong-term resident who ceases to be taxed as a lawful permanent resident (individuals\nwho \"expatriate\") within the 10-year period immediately preceding the close of the\n2\nPLR-117970-98\ntaxable year will be subject to the special rules of section 877(d) for such taxable year,\nunless such loss did not have for one of its principal purposes the avoidance of U.S.\ntaxes.  Sections 2107 and 2501(a)(3) provide special estate and gift tax regimes,\nrespectively, for individuals who expatriate with a principal purpose to avoid U.S. taxes.  \nA former U.S. citizen or former U.S. long-term resident will be treated as having\nexpatriated with a principal purpose to avoid U.S. taxes for purposes of sections 877,\n2107 and 2501(a)(3) if the individual\u2019s average income tax liability or the individual\u2019s net\nworth on the date of expatriation exceed certain thresholds.  See sections 877(a)(2),\n2107(a)(2)(A) and 2501(a)(3)(B).\nA former U.S. citizen whose net worth or average tax liability exceeds these\nthresholds, however, will not be presumed to have a principal purpose of tax avoidance\nif that former citizen is described within certain statutory categories and submits a\nrequest for a ruling within one year of the date of loss of U.S. citizenship for the\nSecretary\u2019s determination as to whether such loss had for one of its principal purposes\nthe avoidance of U.S. taxes.  See sections 877(c)(1), 2107(a)(2)(B), and 2501(a)(3)(C).\nUnder Notice 98-34, 1998-27 I.R.B. 30, modifying Notice 97-19, 1997-1 C.B.\n394, a former long-term resident whose net worth or average tax liability exceeds the\napplicable thresholds will not be presumed to have a principal purpose of tax avoidance\nif that former resident is described within certain categories and submits a complete\nand good faith request for a ruling as to whether such loss had for one of its principal\npurposes the avoidance of U.S. taxes.   \nNotice 98-34, requires that certain information be submitted with a request for a\nruling that an individual's expatriation did not have for one of its principal purposes the\navoidance of U.S. taxes.\nA is eligible to request a ruling pursuant to Notice 98-34 because he is a resident\nand fully liable to tax on his worldwide income in Country B, the country in which he was\nborn.   \nA submitted all of the information required to be submitted by Notice 97-19, as\nmodified by Notice 98-34, including additional information requested by the Service\nafter review of the submission.\nAccordingly, based solely on the information submitted and the representations\nmade, it is held that A has made a complete and good faith submission in accordance\nwith section 877(c)(1)(B) and Notice 98-34.  Therefore, A will not be presumed under\nsection 877(a)(2) to have as one of his principal purposes for expatriating the avoidance\nof U.S. taxes.  It is further held that A will not be treated under section 877(a)(1) as\nhaving as one of his principal purposes for expatriating the avoidance of U.S. taxes\n3\nPLR-117970-98\nbecause the information submitted clearly establishes the lack of a principal purpose to\navoid  taxes under subtitle A or B of the Code.\nExcept as expressly provided herein, no opinion is expressed or implied\nconcerning the tax consequences of any aspect of any transaction or item discussed or\nreferenced in this letter.  In addition, no opinion is expressed as to A\u2019s U.S. tax liability\nfor the taxable years prior to or after his expatriation under sections of the Code other\nthan sections 877, 2107, and 2501(a)(3).\nA copy of this letter must be attached to A\u2019s U.S. income tax return for the year in\nwhich A obtained the ruling (whether or not A is otherwise required to file a return).\nThis ruling is directed only to the taxpayer requesting it.

Additional information \nwas received on September 24, 2007.  The material information submitted for \nconsideration is summarized below. \n \nSUMMARY OF FACTS \n \nParent, a State X corporation, is the common parent of a group of corporations \nthat join in filing a consolidated Federal income tax return (the \u201cParent Group\u201d).  Sub, a \nState X corporation, is wholly owned (directly and indirectly) by Parent and has been a \nmember of the Parent Group since Date 1.  LLC, a State X limited liability company \nwhose membership interests have always been owned entirely by Sub, has been \ndisregarded as an entity separate from Sub for Federal income tax purposes since the \ndate of its organization (Date 4).  \n \nBetween Date 2 and Date 3, Sub made multiple loans to Parent (in the aggregate \namount of $a) for Parent\u2019s general corporate purposes.  Following Sub\u2019s organization of \nLLC, Sub contributed the Sub loans to LLC, together with an interest receivable account \nof approximately $b (the \u201cInterest Receivable Account\u201d) which represented accrued but \nunpaid interest on the loans.  This contribution occurred on Date 5.  On Date 7, \n(i) Parent paid cash of approximately $c (the \u201cCash\u201d) to LLC in full settlement of the \nInterest Receivable Account and (ii) the outstanding multiple loans were consolidated \ninto a single loan from LLC to Parent with a principal amount of $a.  The consolidation \nwas made effective as of Date 6.  The consolidated indebtedness is represented by a \nnote with a Date 8 maturity date (the \u201cParent Note\u201d).  The Parent Note bears interest at \na rate equal to z%, which is considered by the parties to be an arm\u2019s-length rate.  That \nrate is reset every three months, and accrued interest for each calendar quarter is due \nand payable within three business days following the end of the quarter.  \n \nFor what have been represented to be valid business purposes, LLC intends to \nbecome a State X corporation.  LLC will make an election under Treas. Reg.  \nPLR-124914-07 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n3 \n\u00a7 301.7701-3(c) to become classified as an association (and, thus, as a corporation \nunder \u00a7 301.7701-2(b)(2)) for Federal income tax purposes.   \n \nREPRESENTATIONS  \n \nParent has made the following representations: \n \n1) LLC is an entity that is eligible to make an entity classification election under  \n\u00a7 301.7701-3(c) \n \n2) Following LLC\u2019s entity classification election, LLC will be treated as an \nassociation for Federal income tax purposes and will become a member of \nthe Parent Group. \n \n3) Under \u00a7 301.7701-3(g)(1)(iv), the election by LLC to be treated as an \nassociation will result in Sub being treated as transferring the Parent Note \nand Cash to LLC in constructive exchange for shares of LLC stock (this \ndeemed exchange transaction resulting from the entity classification election \nis referred to herein as the \u201cProposed Transaction\u201d).  The Proposed \nTransaction is an intercompany transaction under \u00a7 1.1502-13 that is \ndescribed in \u00a7 351 of the Internal Revenue Code (the \u201cCode\u201d). \n \n4) The Parent Note constitutes indebtedness of Parent to Sub under general \nprinciples of Federal income tax law and an \u201cintercompany obligation\u201d under  \n\u00a7 1.1502-13(g)(2). \n \n \nLAW AND ANALYSIS   \n \nTreas. Reg. \u00a7 1.1502-13(g) (the Current Regulation) provides rules for taking into \naccount items of income, gain, deduction, and loss of members of a consolidated group \nfrom intercompany obligations.  The Current Regulation provides that if a member of a \nconsolidated group realizes an amount (other than zero) of income, gain, deduction, or \nloss, directly or indirectly, from the assignment or extinguishment of all or part of its \nremaining rights or obligations under an intercompany obligation, then the intercompany \nobligation is treated for all Federal income tax purposes as satisfied under paragraph  \n\u00a7 1.1502-13(g)(3)(ii) and, if it remains outstanding, reissued under paragraph \u00a7 1.1502-\n13(g)(3)(iii). \n \nOn December 21, 1998, the IRS and Treasury issued a proposed regulation \nunder \u00a7 1.1502-13(g) (the \u201cProposed Regulation\u201d).  See Prop. Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.1502-\n13(g), 63 Fed. Reg. 70354 (Dec. 21, 1998), 1999-1 C.B. 810.  The preamble to the \nProposed Regulation provides in pertinent part as follows: \n \n \nPLR-124914-07 \n \n \n4 \n\u201cThe proposed regulation clarifies the form and timing of the recast \napplied to transactions subject to the regulation.  In particular, it clarifies \nthat the deemed satisfaction proceeds (rather than the obligation) are \ntreated as transferred by the initial creditor in the actual transaction and \nthen advanced by the transferee to the debtor in the deemed reissuance \nof the obligation.  The proposed regulation includes an example to \nillustrate clearly the mechanics of the proposed regulation.  It also includes \ncertain conforming adjustments. \n. . . . \n \nProposed Effective Date \n \nThe regulation is proposed to be effective on the date that the final \nregulation is published in the Federal Register.  For purposes of \ndetermining the tax treatment of transactions undertaken prior to such \neffective date, taxpayers may rely on the form and timing of the recast \ntransaction, as clarified by these proposed regulations.  No inference is \nintended, however, as to the correct interpretation of the existing \nregulation.\u201d \n \nRULINGS \n \nBased solely on the information submitted and the representations set forth \nabove, we rule as follows: \n \na) Sub\u2019s deemed exchange of the Parent Note for LLC stock is a realization \nevent described in Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.1502-13(g)(3)(i).  The taxpayer may rely \non the form and timing of the recast transaction as described in the Proposed \nRegulation.  Accordingly, the consequences of the deemed satisfaction and \nreissuance will be as set forth in rulings (b) through (f) below. \n \nb) Immediately before it\u2019s deemed exchange by Sub, the Parent Note will be \ntreated as satisfied by Parent. \n \nc) Sub will be treated as transferring the proceeds of the deemed satisfaction to \nLLC in exchange for stock of LLC in an intercompany transaction. \n \nd) Parent will be treated as issuing a new note (the \u201cReissued Note\u201d) to LLC in \nexchange for the proceeds of the deemed satisfaction. \n \ne) The Reissued Note will be deemed to have a new holding period and an \nissue price equal to the amount of the deemed satisfaction proceeds, but \notherwise will be treated as having terms identical to those of the Parent \nNote. \n \nPLR-124914-07 \n \n \n5 \n \nf) LLC\u2019s initial tax basis in the Reissued Note will equal the amount of the \ndeemed satisfaction proceeds. \n \nCAVEATS \n \nThe rulings contained in this letter are based on facts and representations \nsubmitted by the taxpayer and accompanied by a penalty of perjury statement executed \nby an appropriate party.  This office has not verified any of the materials submitted in \nsupport of the request for rulings.  Verification of the information, representations, and \nother data may be required as part of the audit process. \n \nNo opinion is expressed about the tax treatment of the Proposed Transaction \nunder other provisions of the Code or regulations or the tax treatment of any conditions \nexisting at the time of, or effects resulting from, the Proposed Transaction that are not \nspecifically covered by the above rulings. \n \nPROCEDURAL STATEMENTS \n \nThis ruling letter is directed only to the taxpayer requesting it.

Taxpayer is a limited liability company\ncreated and existing under the laws of State for the purpose of constructing a 39-story\nmixed use building at the Project Area.  Authority is a public benefit corporation created\nby the legislature of State through passage of the Act.  Authority was created for the\npurpose of financing, constructing and operating a planned community development at\nthe Project Area.  The legislative purpose was set forth in the Act as follows:  \nthe creation in such area...of a mixed commercial and residential community, with\nadequate utilities systems and civic and public facilities such as schools, open public\nspaces, recreational and cultural facilities is necessary for the prosperity and welfare\nof the people of..., and is a public use and public purpose for which tax exemptions\nmay be granted....\n[T]he creation of...[Authority] and the carrying out of its corporate purposes is in all\nrespects for the benefit of the people of...and is a public purpose, and...[Authority]\nshall be regarded as performing a governmental function in the exercise of the\npowers conferred upon it...and shall be required to pay no taxes upon any of the\n\u0015\nproperties acquired by it or under its jurisdiction or control or supervision or upon its\nactivities.\nThus, under Authority\u2019s originating legislation, Authority is exempt from real property\ntaxes on property in the Project Area .  \nThe Project Area was originally owned by City, which executed a Master Lease to\nAuthority.  The Master Lease incorporates a master plan which governs the\ndevelopment of the Project Area and provides, in part, that Authority will provide\nmunicipal facilities in the Project Area, including sewers, water lines, hydrants, parks\nand plazas, a waterfront esplanade, and other civic, cultural, and recreational facilities. \nCorporation is an agency of State.  In order to expedite development of the Project\nArea, Corporation exercised its power of eminent domain to acquire fee simple title to\nthe Project Area, subject to the Master Lease.  Subsequently, Corporation conveyed\ntitle to the Project Area to Subsidiary, which then transferred title to the Authority. \nHowever, pursuant to the terms of the deed and the Master Lease, there is no merger\nof title even though Authority then became both landlord and tenant.  At the time of the\noriginal acquisition of the Project Area by Corporation, City was granted all rights of\nreacquisition with respect to all rights of Corporation, Subsidiary, and Authority in the\nProject Area, in addition to all net assets of Authority, once Authority repays the\nindebtedness incurred in respect of the Project Area.  Alternatively, City can reacquire\nthe Project Area at an earlier date by providing funds sufficient to repay such\nindebtedness.  \nThe Master Lease provides that each sublease of the property, i.e., of a parcel in the\nProject Area, that is to be improved with housing shall provide for the payment to\nAuthority of the applicable amount of tax equivalency payments.  Tax equivalency\npayments are required by the Act that created Authority, which provides:  \nIf the underlying parcel is exempt from real property taxes ...the residential lease for\nsuch underlying parcel shall provide for the payment by the owner of such\nresidential lease to the [Authority] of annual or other periodic amounts equal to the\namount of real property taxes that otherwise would be paid or payable with respect\nto such underlying parcel, after giving effect to any real property tax abatements and\nexemptions, if any, which would be applicable thereto...[if the statutory provisions\nexempting the property from real property taxes] were not applicable to such\nunderlying parcel.\nIf City reacquires the Project Area it will be required to impose tax equivalency payment\nobligations.  \nThe tax equivalency payments that apply to the type of housing that Taxpayer is\nconstructing in the Project Area is the amount equal to the product of the assessed\nvalue of the parcel and any improvements multiplied by City\u2019s real property tax rate,\nless the amount of any tax exemptions or abatements that would be available if the fee\n\u0016\nwas not owned by a tax exempt entity.  \nAuthority leased land (under the \"Site Lease\") in the Project Area (the \"property\") to\nTaxpayer for a period coterminous with the Master Lease.  The Site Lease requires\nTaxpayer to construct a 39-story building containing approximately 170 residential units\nand two commercial units on the property.  \nTaxpayer intends to subject its leasehold estate in the property to condominium\nownership under state law and to assign to condominium purchasers leasehold\ninterests in the apartment units and proportionate individual leasehold interests in the\ncommon elements of the buildings.  Under the condominium law of State, once any part\nof the Project Area becomes subject to condominium ownership the unit owners are\npersonally liable for taxes assessed.  The law requires common expenses to be\ncharged to the unit owners accordng to their respective common interests.   \nThe Site Lease provides that the common charges include a rental payment, part of\nwhich is PILOT.  The amount of PILOT is equal to the tax equivalency payments as\ndefined and adjusted in the Site Lease.  After the property is converted to condominium\nownership a board of managers designated or elected by unit owners will administer the\naffairs of the condominium including the determination of common charges.  The\ncommon charges will be payable by each unit owner to the board of managers.  The\nboard of managers in turn is required to pay the rental due under the Site Lease to\nAuthority.\nThe Master Lease and the Site Lease thus provide the collection vehicles for the tax\nequivalency payment and corresponding PILOT obligations which are, however,\nauthorized and imposed under specific statutory authority.  \nAuthority will commingle PILOT with other monies it receives from the Project Area. \nAuthority may disburse the funds for the following purposes:  \n(a) to meet the debt service on bonds issued by the Authority, the proceeds of which\nhave been and will be used to construct the above described municipal facilities and\nservices in the Project Area;  \n(b) to maintain the various reserves and sinking funds required to be maintained\nunder the Authority\u2019s Bond Resolution; and  \n(c) to pay the Authority\u2019s operating and administrative expenses.\nAuthority revenues attributable to PILOT that exceed those needed for these or other\n\u0017\n\u0014\u0003\u0003The City Rent Fund was established solely for the purpose of paying City\nadditional rent required under the Master Lease, in the amount of the excess of\nrevenues derived over obligations incurred with respect to the Project Area.  City and\nCorporation subsequently assigned to Authority their rights to receive payments from\nthe City Rent Fund.  Accordingly, all revenue from the Project Area remains with\nAuthority and Authority may use the funds only in furtherance of Authority\u2019s public\npurpose.  \npublic purposes generally will be remitted to the City Rent Fund.1\nRULINGS REQUESTED\n1.  The PILOT payments to be made pursuant to the Site Lease to Authority (or to City\nshould it reacquire the Project Area) will constitute real property taxes allowable as a\ndeduction to the payor under \u00a7 164.  \n2.  Following Taxpayer's submission of the leasehold estate in the property to\ncondominium ownership, the unit owners will be entitled to deduct as real property\ntaxes under \u00a7 164 that portion of the common charges paid by them to the board of\nmanagers as are applied by the board of managers towards the PILOT obligations.  \nA taxpayer may not rely on a private letter ruling that has been issued to another\ntaxpayer.  Rev. Proc. 99-1, 1999-1 I.R.B. 6, \u00a7 12.02.  Therefore, a private letter ruling \naddresses only the tax liability of taxpayers who are party to the ruling request. \nHowever, Taxpayer will be the owner of all units in the condominium from the time its\ninterest in the property is submitted to condominium ownership until the units are sold\nand, as such, will be liable for PILOT until the units are sold.  We consider Taxpayer's\nsecond ruling request in that context.\nLAW AND ANALYSIS\nSection 164 allows as a deduction the state, local and foreign real property taxes paid\nor accrued in the taxable year.  Section 1.164-3(b) of the Income Tax Regulations\ndefines real property taxes as taxes imposed on interests in real property that are levied\nfor the general public welfare.  Assessments for local benefits are not treated as real\nproperty taxes.  See \u00a7 1.164-4.  \nWhether a particular charge is a tax within the meaning of \u00a7 164 depends on its true\nnature as determined under federal law.  The designation given by local law is not\ndeterminative.  A charge will constitute a tax if it is an enforced contribution, exacted\npursuant to legislative authority in the exercise of the taxing power, and imposed and\ncollected for the purpose of raising revenues to be used for public or governmental\npurposes.   Rev. Rul. 71-49, 1971-1 C.B. 103; Rev. Rul. 61-152, 1961-2 C.B. 42.  \n\u0018\nRev. Rul. 71-49 involved tax equivalency payments to the New York City Educational\nConstruction Fund, a public benefit corporation, by a cooperative housing corporation. \nThe payments were applied to debt service on obligations funding public school\nconstruction.  The ruling holds that the cooperative housing corporation may deduct the\npayments as real property taxes under \u00a7 164 because (1) the payments are measured\nby and are equal to the amounts imposed by the regular taxing statutes, (2) the\npayments are imposed by a specific state statute (even though the vehicle of a lease\nagreement is used), and (3) the proceeds are designated for a public purpose rather\nthan for some privilege, service, or regulatory function, or for some other local benefit\ntending to increase the value of the property upon which the payments are made. \nAccordingly, each tenant-stockholder of the cooperative housing corporation may\ndeduct the payments in the amount of the stockholder's proportionate share.\nThe PILOT obligations in this case also satisfy the three-prong test of Rev. Rul. 71-49: \n(1) PILOT are imposed at the same general rate at which real property taxes are\nimposed; (2) PILOT are imposed by state statute although the law uses the vehicle of\nleasing agreements; and (3) PILOT may only be used by Authority for public purposes,\nincluding debt service of bonds issued to construct municipal facilities and services, and\npayment of operating and administrative expenses.\nAccordingly, we hold as follows:\n1.  The PILOT obligations to be made pursuant to the Site Lease to Authority (or to City\nshould it reacquire the Project Area) constitute real property taxes allowable as a\ndeduction to the payor under \u00a7 164.  \n2.  Following the submission of the leasehold estate in the property to condominium\nownership, Taxpayer as a unit owner will be entitled to deduct as real property taxes\nunder \u00a7 164 the portion of the common charges that Taxpayer pays to the board of\nmanagers and that are applied by the board of managers to the PILOT obligations.\nCaveats:\nA copy of this letter must be attached to any income tax return to which it is relevant. \nExcept as expressly provided herein, no opinion is expressed or implied concerning the\ntax consequences of any aspect of any transaction or item discussed or referenced in\nthis letter.  \nThis ruling is directed only to the taxpayer requesting it.  Section 6110(k)(3) provides\nthat it may not be used or cited as precedent.\nSincerely,\nAssistant Chief Counsel\n(Income Tax & Accounting)\nBy George Baker\nAssistant to Branch Chief, Branch 2\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Non-Adverse"}]}

The Funds request extensions of\ntime pursuant to \u00a7301.9100-1(a) of the Procedure and\nAdministration Regulations to elect under \u00a7\u00a7 851 and 855 of the\nInternal Revenue Code.\nPLR-101716-99\n2\nFACTS\nFund A is a State corporation that is registered as an open-\nend diversified management company under the Investment Company\nAct of 1940.  Funds B and C are separate series of Fund A that\nare treated as separate corporations under \u00a7851(h) of the Code.  \nThe Funds commenced on Date 1.  They use a fiscal year\nending on the last day of Month.  The first returns for Funds\nwere due on Date 3.\nThe Funds have no employees.  Firm serves as custodian,\ntransfer agent, administrator and accounting service agent for\nthe Funds.  Firm also files their extensions of time (Form 7004)\nfor filing federal corporate income tax returns.\nFrom inception, the Funds intended to be taxed as regulated\ninvestment companies (\"RICs\") under section 851 of the Code.  The\nFunds attached RIC election statements to their initial Forms\n1120-RIC and computed their taxable income as RICs on their\ninitial Forms 1120-RIC.  Their intention is also reflected on\ntheir Forms 7004, which indicates that the type of form for which\nan extension is requested is Form 1120-RIC.\nThe due date for the Funds initial income tax returns or\nrequests for extension of time (Form 7004) was Date 3.  The Funds\nretained Firm to file Forms 7004 on their behalf, and the Forms\n7004 were mailed on Date 4, some days prior to Date 3.  Due to an\nerror by Firm\u2019s employees, the Forms 7004 were mailed by\ncertified mail, but without \"return receipt requested\". \nConsequently, the Funds have no documentary evidence from the\nU.S. Postal Service that the forms were received prior to Date 3,\nthe due date.  In addition, the forms were mailed to the wrong\nInternal Revenue Service Center, and the appropriate service\ncenter did not receive the forms until after the due date.  By\nletter dated Date 5, the appropriate service center denied the\nFunds\u2019 extensions requested in their Forms 7004.  The Funds filed\ntheir initial Forms 1120-RIC on Date 6.\nThe Funds make the following representations:\n1.  The request for relief was filed by the taxpayer before\nthe failure to make the regulatory election was discovered\nby the Service.\n2.  Granting the relief will not result in the taxpayer\nhaving a lower tax liability in the aggregate for all years\nto which the regulatory election applies than the taxpayer\nwould have had if the election had been timely made (taking\ninto account the time value of money).\nPLR-101716-99\n3\n \n3.  The taxpayer did not seek to alter a return position for\nwhich an accuracy-related penalty has been or could have\nbeen imposed under section 6662 of the Code at the time the\ntaxpayer requested relief and the new position requires or\npermits a regulatory election for which relief is requested.\n4.  Being fully informed of the required regulatory election\nand related tax consequences, the taxpayer did not choose to\nnot file the election.\nAPPLICABLE LAW\nSection 301.9100-1(c) of the regulations provides, in part,\nthat the Commissioner has discretion to grant a reasonable\nextension of time to make a regulatory election (defined in\nsection 301.9100-1(b) as an election whose deadline is prescribed\nby regulations or by a revenue ruling, a revenue procedure, a\nnotice, or an announcement published in the Internal Revenue\nBulletin), or a statutory election (but no more than 6 months\nexcept in the case of a taxpayer who is abroad), under all\nsubtitles of the Internal Revenue Code except subtitles E, G, H,\nand I.\nSection 301.9100-3(a) through (c)(1)(i) of the regulations\nsets forth rules that the Internal Revenue Service generally will\nuse to determine whether, under the facts and circumstances of\neach situation, the Commissioner will grant an extension of time\nfor regulatory elections that do not meet the requirements of\nsection 301.9100-2.  Section 301.9100-3(b) provides that subject\nto paragraphs (b)(3)(i) through (iii) of section 301.9100-3, when\na taxpayer applies for relief under this section before the\nfailure to make the regulatory election is discovered by the\nService, the taxpayer will be deemed to have acted reasonably and\nin good faith; and section 301.9100-3(c) provides that the\ninterests of the government are prejudiced if granting relief\nwould result in the taxpayer having a lower tax liability in the\naggregate for all years to which the regulatory election applies\nthan the taxpayer would have had if the election had been timely\nmade (taking into account the time value of money).\nCONCLUSION\nBased upon the facts and representations submitted, it is\nheld that the Funds have shown good cause for granting reasonable\nextensions of time to allow them to make elections under \u00a7\u00a7851\nand 855 of the Code.  Accordingly, the time for filing the\nelections is extended to Date 6.\nPLR-101716-99\n4\nNo opinion is expressed as to whether any taxpayer\u2019s tax\nliability is not lower in the aggregate for all years to which\nthe regulatory election applies than its tax liability would have\nbeen if the election had been timely made (taking into account\nthe time value of money).  Upon audit of the federal income tax\nreturns involved, the district director\u2019s office will determine\nthe taxpayer\u2019s tax liability for the years involved.  If the\ndistrict director\u2019s office determines the taxpayer\u2019s liability is\nlower, that office will determine the federal income tax effect.\nThis ruling is limited to the timeliness of the Funds\u2019\nelections.  This ruling does not relieve Funds from any penalty\nthey may owe as a result of their failure to file their federal\nincome tax returns on time.  This ruling\u2019s application is limited\nto the facts, Code sections, and regulations cited herein.  No\nopinion is expressed as to whether The Funds qualify as RICs\nunder subchapter M, part I, of the Code.\nA copy of this letter is being forwarded to the service\ncenter where Funds file their returns with instructions that\nalthough their Form 1120-RICs or extensions to file were not\ntimely filed, Funds are to be treated as having made timely\nelections under \u00a7\u00a7851 and 855 of the Code.\nExcept as specifically provided otherwise, no opinion is\nexpressed on the federal income tax consequences of the\ntransaction described above.\nThis ruling is directed only to the taxpayer that requested\nit.

P seeks a confirmation of the rulings in light of the purchase of a x% interest in P\nby Z and the potential use of an alternative chemical reagent used to produce synthetic\nfuel in P\u2019s synthetic fuel facility (the Facility) located at E\u2019s site in Location 1 (the Site)\n2\nPLR-125230-02\nas described in the ruling request from P\u2019s authorized representative.\nP is a Delaware limited liability company, taxable as a partnership.  P constructed, owns\nand operates the Facility for producing a solid synthetic fuel from coal (the Product)\nusing the process described below.  The Facility is a Secondary Coal Recovery System\n#         designed by A.  The Facility consists of          production lines each of which\nconsists of a                 which is fed by its associated mixer and each of which is\ncapable of being operated independently.  Because each production line is capable of\nbeing operated independently and can independently produce synthetic fuel, each\nindependent production line may be treated as a separate facility. \nThe Facility was constructed pursuant to a written contract entered into by A and B on\nDate 2.  A assigned to P all of its rights and obligations under the construction contract\nwith respect to one facility.  On Date 3, B subcontracted with C to perform the\nprocurement, assembly and installation services under the construction contract.  P\nprovided an opinion of counsel that the construction contract constituted a binding\nwritten contract under applicable state laws prior to January 1, 1997, and at all times\nthereafter through completion of the contract.  \nOn Date 4, P received a Determination Letter from the District Director for the State 1\nDistrict that the Facility was placed in service prior to July 1, 1998.\nOn Date 5, X purchased a x% interest in P from D pursuant to a Purchase Agreement,\nas amended on Date 6.  Y purchased the remaining y% interest in P from A on Date 7\npursuant to a Purchase Agreement.\nP relocated the Facility to the Site.  P has represented that following the relocation the\nfair market value of the original property is more than 20 percent of the Facility\u2019s total\nvalue (the cost of the new property plus the value of the original property). \nP has entered into a Sales Agency Agreement for Synthetic Fuel with F, an affiliate of\nE, for the sale of the Product to unrelated purchasers.  P has represented that all sales\nof synthetic fuel will be to unrelated persons.  \nOn Date 8, X sold its x% interest in P to Z pursuant to an Agreement for Purchase of\nMembership Interest.  In exchange for the x% interest in P, Z paid to X an amount of\ncash at closing and Z is obligated to make certain fixed and variable payments to X. \nFollowing the sale, Z owns x% of the interests in P and Y continues to own the\nremaining y% interest in P.  \nOn Date 8, Y and Z also entered into an Amended and Restated Limited Liability\nCompany Agreement.  Y remains the manager of P.\nP has supplied a detailed description of the process employed at the Facility.  As\ndescribed, the Facility and the process implemented in the Facility, including the\nalternative chemical reagents used to produce the synthetic fuel, meet the requirements\nof Rev. Proc. 2001-34, 2001-22 I.R.B. 1293.\n3\nPLR-125230-02\nA recognized expert in combustion, coal, and chemical analysis has performed\nnumerous tests on the coal used at the Facility and the Product produced at the Facility\nand has submitted reports in which the expert concludes that significant chemical\nchanges take place with the application of the process to the coal.\nThe rulings issued in PLR 200216002, which you wish to be reconfirmed in this private\nletter ruling, are as follows:\n1. P, with use of the process, will produce a \u201cqualified fuel\u201d within the meaning of\nsection 29(c)(1)(C). \n2. The production of qualified fuel from the Facility will be attributable solely to P\nwithin the meaning of section 29(a)(2)(B) of the Code, entitling P to the section\n29 credit for qualified fuel sold to unrelated persons. \n3. The contract for the construction of the Facility constitutes a \u201cbinding written\ncontract\u201d within the meaning of section 29(g)(1)(A) of the Code.\n4. The section 29 credit attributable to P may be allocated to the members of P in\naccordance with the members\u2019 interests in P when the credit arises.  For the\nallocation of the section 29 credit, a member\u2019s interest in P is determined based\non a valid allocation of the receipts from the sale of the section 29 qualified fuel.\n5. A termination of P under section 708(b)(1)(B) will not preclude the reconstituted\npartnership from claiming the section 29 credit on the production and sale of\nqualified fuel to unrelated persons.\n6. Because the Facility was \u201cplaced in service\u201d prior to July 1, 1998 within the\nmeaning of section 29(g)(1), relocation of the Facility to a different location after\nJune 30, 1998, or replacement of part of the Facility after that date, will not result\nin a new placed in service date for the Facility for purposes section 29 provided\nthe fair market value of the original property is more than 20 percent of the\nFacility\u2019s total fair market value at the time of relocation or replacement.\nThe changes in facts since the issuance of PLR 200216002 are the purchase of a x%\ninterest in P by Z and the potential use of an alternative chemical reagent to produce\nthe synthetic fuel in the Facility as described in the ruling request by P\u2019s authorized\nrepresentative.\nThe above rulings are not affected by the purchase of a x% interest in P by Z and the\npotential use of an alternative chemical reagent to produce the synthetic fuel in the\nFacility as described in the ruling request by P\u2019s authorized representative.  \nAccordingly, we re-issue the rulings given in PLR 200216002.  Thus in summary: \n1. P, with use of the process, will produce a \u201cqualified fuel\u201d within the meaning of\nsection 29(c)(1)(C). \n4\nPLR-125230-02\n2. The production of qualified fuel from the Facility will be attributable solely to P\nwithin the meaning of section 29(a)(2)(B) of the Code, entitling P to the section\n29 credit for qualified fuel sold to unrelated persons. \n3. The contract for the construction of the Facility constitutes a \u201cbinding written\ncontract\u201d within the meaning of section 29(g)(1)(A) of the Code.\n4. The section 29 credit attributable to P may be allocated to the members of P in\naccordance with the members\u2019 interests in P when the credit arises.  For the\nallocation of the section 29 credit, a member\u2019s interest in P is determined based\non a valid allocation of the receipts from the sale of the section 29 qualified fuel.\n5. A termination of P under section 708(b)(1)(B) will not preclude the reconstituted\npartnership from claiming the section 29 credit on the production and sale of\nqualified fuel to unrelated persons.\n6. Because the Facility was \u201cplaced in service\u201d prior to July 1, 1998 within the\nmeaning of section 29(g)(1), relocation of the Facility to a different location after\nJune 30, 1998, or replacement of part of the Facility after that date, will not result\nin a new placed in service date for the Facility for purposes section 29 provided\nthe fair market value of the original property is more than 20 percent of the\nFacility\u2019s total fair market value at the time of relocation or replacement.\nExcept as specifically ruled upon above, we express no opinion concerning the federal\nincome tax consequences of the transaction described above. \nThis ruling is directed only to the taxpayer(s) requesting it.

You also requested rulings concerning the PI Trust,\nwhich Taxpayer will fund to pay some of those liabilities.\nFACTS:\n2\nPLR-114666-00\nYou represent the facts to be as follows:\nTAXPAYER\u2019S HISTORY\nTaxpayer and its subsidiaries are engaged in the manufacture and distribution of\ncertain products.  Taxpayer, which was incorporated as a subsidiary of Corporation\nduring date 1, has used the accrual method of accounting since its incorporation. \nBefore date 1, Corporation had been named as a defendant in numerous lawsuits\nclaiming damages for personal physical injury, physical sickness, or death from\nexposure to Item that was included in products that Corporation sold. \nUntil Year 1, Corporation manufactured products in Site 1 and Site 2.  These\nmanufacturing operations generated large amounts of hazardous materials that either\nremain on those sites, or were transported to landfills, or have contaminated other sites\n(including wetlands and groundwater).  Consequently, the Agency and the State have\nundertaken operations to investigate and remediate the hazardous substance\ncontaminations caused by Corporation\u2019s operations in Site 1 and Site 2.                 \nDuring date 2, Taxpayer became the parent corporation of Corporation.  Taxpayer then\ndevised a restructuring plan under which it acquired valuable business assets from\nCorporation, divested itself of its Corporation shares, and attempted to divest itself of\nCorporation\u2019s Item-related liabilities.  Thereafter, Taxpayer was named a co-defendant\nwith Corporation in numerous Item-related lawsuits as successor in liability to\nCorporation.  Subsequently, federal courts have held that Taxpayer was a successor to\nCorporation\u2019s Item-related liabilities and issued an order barring Taxpayer from\ncontinuing to litigate the issue of its successor liability for Corporation\u2019s liabilities.    \nPLAN OF REORGANIZATION\nDuring date 3, Taxpayer filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in a United States\nBankruptcy Court (the \u201cBankruptcy Court\u201d).  During date 4, Taxpayer entered into a\nMemorandum of Understanding with its unsecured creditors (the \u201cUnsecured\nCreditors\u201d), the terms of which have been incorporated into a consensual plan of\nreorganization (\u201cthe Plan\u201d).  The Plan and each of its provisions were confirmed in their\nentirety in the order (the \u201cOrder\u201d) of the Bankruptcy Court that was entered on date 5.\nThe Order also stated that the Bankruptcy Court has and will retain exclusive\njurisdiction of the litigation and of the PI Trust, which was established by the Plan.\nComposition of the Unsecured Creditors.  Almost all of the Unsecured Creditors\nconsist of the following groups:  (1) the PI Claimants, who are all individuals holding\npresent or future Item-related personal injury tort claims against Corporation for which\nTaxpayer has successor liability; and (2) the Environmental Claimants.  The\nEnvironmental Claimants consist of the Agency, the State, and one private party\nholding environmental claims under federal and state environmental laws against\nTaxpayer.  In the Chapter 11 proceeding, the claims held by the PI Claimants and the\n3\nPLR-114666-00\nclaims of the Environmental Claimants have been estimated at approximately $b and\n$c, respectively.       \nDescription of the Unsecured Creditors\u2019 Share.  The Plan provides that the\nUnsecured Creditors will receive Taxpayer Stock, Available Cash, and Tax Benefits. \nThese assets are referred to collectively as the Unsecured Creditors\u2019 Share.  \nTaxpayer Stock consists of stock of the reorganized Taxpayer.  The Unsecured\nCreditors (through the PI Trust in the case of the PI Claimants) will receive d percent of\nTaxpayer Stock and Taxpayer\u2019s pre-existing shareholders will retain e percent of\nTaxpayer stock.  Taxpayer Stock\u2019s overall value was appraised in a qualified appraisal\ndescribed in \u00a7 1.468B-3(b) of the Income Tax Regulations. Taxpayer provided a copy of\nthis appraisal to the administrator of the PI Trust on date 6 and attached a copy of the\nappraisal to its income tax return in the time and manner required by \u00a7 1.468B-3(b)(2).   \n           \nThe Available Cash, determined when the Plan was consummated, equaled $f.  It\nconsisted of the amount of cash that was not reasonably needed to meet certain\nestimated near-term cash operating needs and capital needs of the reorganized debtor\non the effective date of the Plan. \nThe Tax Benefits are described in the Plan\u2019s Tax Assignment and Assumption\nAgreement (the \u201cTax Agreement\u201d).  Under the Tax Agreement, the PI Claimants and\nthe other Unsecured Creditors collectively will receive present and future federal and\nstate income tax savings relating to transfers to the PI Trust and to the implementation\nof the settlement plan.\nTaxpayer is obligated by the Tax Agreement to take all reasonable actions necessary to\nobtain the Tax Benefits and to pay them over to the Unsecured Creditors as\nexpeditiously as possible.  Taxpayer anticipates that most of the net operating loss\n(\u201cNOL\u201d) resulting from the contribution of Taxpayer Stock and Available Cash to the\nUnsecured Creditors will be carried back 10 years.  This NOL is anticipated to result in\na tax refund of approximately $g.  The balance will be carried forward.  Payment to the\nUnsecured Creditors of the Tax Benefit resulting from the carryback, as well as the use\nby Taxpayer of the carryforward, will then give rise to future Tax Benefits that must also\nbe transferred to the Unsecured Creditors pursuant to the Tax Agreement.  All Tax\nBenefits will be paid in cash.\nThe Governments\u2019 Agreement:  Division of the Unsecured Creditors\u2019 Share.  The\nPI Claimants and the Environmental Claimants agreed in a Governments\u2019 Settlement\nAgreement (the \u201cGovernments\u2019 Agreement\u201d) to divide the Unsecured Creditors\u2019 Share\ninto sub-shares.\nUnder the Governments\u2019 Agreement, a de minimis sub-share of the Unsecured\nCreditors\u2019 Share was allocated to the Allowed Claims of unsecured creditors other than\nthe PI Claimants and the Environmental Claimants.  The PI Claimants and the\nEnvironmental Claimants also agreed on how to allocate the amount of the Unsecured\n4\nPLR-114666-00\nCreditors\u2019 Share remaining after the Allowed Claims were paid.  Of that remaining\namount, h percent was to be transferred into the PI Trust.  The PI Trust would assume\nTaxpayer\u2019s tort liability to the PI Claimants by processing and paying their claims in\naccordance with specified procedures (\u201cPI Trust Distribution Procedures\u201d).  The\nEnvironmental Claimants, which have no interests in the PI Trust, would receive the\nremaining j percent of the Unsecured Creditors\u2019 Share.\nDischarge of Liabilities.  Upon Taxpayer\u2019s transfer of the Taxpayer Stock and its\npayments of Available Cash and Tax Benefits, Taxpayer\u2019s obligations to the PI\nClaimants and Environmental Claimants were discharged. \nTerms of the PI Trust Agreement and the PI Trust Distribution Procedures.  You\nrepresent that under the present terms of the PI Trust Agreement and the PI Trust\nDistribution Procedures, the PI Trust may not make a payment to a PI Claimant except\nwith respect to a personal physical injury that manifests itself before the date of the\npayment. You also represent that payments from the PI Trust to the PI Claimants are\nsolely for compensatory damages on account of currently manifested, personal,\nphysical injuries, within the meaning of \u00a7 104(a)(2) and that the present PI Trust\ndocuments do not allow payments from the PI Trust to the PI Claimants for interest,\npunitive damages, or any other item of taxable income.  \nBecause numerous PI Claimants are expected to file claims against the PI Trust over\nits lifetime, the PI Trust would not find it practical to require PI Claimants to provide\nprior-year tax returns or otherwise to have access to those returns for purposes of\ndetermining whether such Claimants have taken any medical expense deductions\nunder \u00a7 213 relating to any personal injuries with respect to which any amounts may be\npaid by the PI Trust.\nExpenses of the PI Trust.  The PI Trust expects to incur costs, including the costs\nrelated to recovery of amounts on certain Item-related claims and causes of action\ntransferred to the PI Trust by Taxpayer.  The PI Trust does not expect to recover any\nclaims for insurance proceeds transferred to the PI Trust by Taxpayer.      \nLAW AND ANALYSIS\nTaxpayer's requested rulings fall into two broad categories.  The first of these involves\nthe legal status, federal income tax consequences, and information reporting\nrequirements of the PI Trust (Ruling Requests 1 through 6); the second, the federal tax\nconsequences to Taxpayer resulting from its transfers to and fulfillment of its obligations\nto the Unsecured Creditors (Ruling Requests 7 through 12).  \nRULINGS RELATING TO THE PI TRUST\nRuling Request 1:  Is the PI Trust a qualified settlement fund?\n5\nPLR-114666-00\nSection 468B(g) provides that nothing in any provision of law shall be construed as\nproviding that an escrow account, settlement fund, or similar fund is not subject to\ncurrent income tax.  The Secretary shall prescribe regulations providing for the taxation\nof any such account or fund whether as a grantor trust or otherwise.    \nSection 1.468B-1(c) provides that the following requirements must be met for a fund,\naccount, or trust to be classified as a qualified settlement fund (QSF):  (1) it must be\nestablished pursuant to an order of, or be approved by, the United States or any\nagency or instrumentality (including a court of law) thereof and be subject to the\ncontinuing jurisdiction of that governmental authority; (2) it must be established to\nresolve or satisfy one or more contested or uncontested claims that have resulted or\nmay result from an event (or related series of events) that has occurred and that has\ngiven rise to at least one claim asserting liability arising out of tort, breach of contract, or\nviolation of law; and (3) the fund, account, or trust must be a trust under applicable\nstate law, or its assets must otherwise be segregated from other assets of the\ntransferor.\nThe PI Trust meets each of the requirements of \u00a7 1.468B-1(c).  First, the PI Trust was\napproved by the Bankruptcy Court and is subject to that court\u2019s continuing jurisdiction. \nSecond, the PI Trust was established to resolve Item-related tort claims.  Third, the PI\nTrust is organized as a trust under applicable state law.  \nAccordingly, based on the information submitted and representations made, we\nconclude that the PI Trust is a QSF under \u00a7 1.468B-1(c).\nRuling Request 2:  Is the PI Trust subject to income tax only on its modified gross\nincome? \nSection 1.468B-2(a) provides that a QSF is subject to tax on its modified gross income\nfor any taxable year at a rate equal to the maximum rate in effect for that taxable year\nunder \u00a7 1(e).  The modified gross income of a QSF is its gross income, as defined in\n\u00a7 61, computed with the modifications listed in \u00a7 1.468B-2(b)(1) - (4).  As noted above,\nthe PI Trust is a QSF.  \nAccordingly, based on the information submitted and representations made, we\nconclude that only the modified gross income of the PI Trust is subject to federal\nincome tax.\nRuling Request 3:  Are the amounts of Taxpayer\u2019s transfers of Taxpayer Stock,\nTax Benefits, and Available Cash to the PI Trust excludable from the PI Trust\u2019s\ngross income?\nSection 1.468B-2(b)(1) provides, in general, that amounts transferred to a QSF by, or\non behalf of, a transferor to resolve or satisfy a liability for which the fund is established\nare excluded from a QSF\u2019s gross income.  Taxpayer\u2019s transfers to the PI Trust of\nTaxpayer Stock, Tax Benefits, and Available Cash fall squarely within \u00a7 1.468-2(b)(1).  \n6\nPLR-114666-00\n1  The Governments\u2019 Agreement indicates that the Environmental Claimants may transfer\nTaxpayer Stock to the PI Trust under certain circumstances.  You have not requested a ruling, and we\ndo not rule, regarding the tax consequences of any transfer of Taxpayer Stock by the Environmental\nClaimants, either to the PI Trust or to any other person.\nThese transfers are in full satisfaction of the PI Claimants\u2019 present and future claims\nagainst Taxpayer.  The PI Trust, in turn, was established for the express purposes of\nassuming Taxpayer\u2019s tort liabilities and paying the claims of the PI Claimants.  \nAccordingly, based on the information submitted and representations made, we\nconclude that the amounts transferred to the PI Trust \u2013 its sub-share of Taxpayer\nStock, Tax Benefits, and Available Cash \u2013 are excludable from the PI Trust\u2019s gross\nincome under \u00a7 1.468B-2(b)(1). \nRuling Request 4:  Is the PI Trust allowed to deduct its administrative costs?\nSection 1.468B-2(b)(2) allows a QSF to deduct administrative costs and other incidental\nexpenses incurred in connection with the operation of the QSF that would be deductible\nunder Chapter 1 of the Code in determining the taxable income of a corporation. \nAdministrative costs and other incidental expenses include state and local taxes, legal,\naccounting, and actuarial fees relating to the operation of the QSF, and expenses\narising from the notification of claimants and the processing of their claims. \nAdministrative costs and other incidental expenses do not include legal fees incurred\nby, or on behalf of, claimants.\nAccordingly, based on the information submitted and representations made, we\nconclude that the PI Trust is allowed a deduction in computing its modified gross\nincome for those administrative costs and incidental expenses it incurs that would be\ndeductible under Chapter 1 of the Code in computing the gross income of a\ncorporation.  No opinion is expressed, however, whether any particular expense\nincurred by the PI Trust is an expense that is deductible under \u00a7 1.468B-2(b)(2).   \nRuling Request 5:  Is the PI Trust\u2019s basis in Taxpayer Stock the fair market value\nof that stock on the date it is transferred by Taxpayer to the PI Trust?   \nSection 1.468B-2(e) provides that a QSF\u2019s initial basis in the property it receives from a\ntransferor (or from an insurer or other person on behalf of a transferor) is the fair market\nvalue of that property on the date of transfer to the fund.  \nTaxpayer is a transferor under \u00a7 1.468B-1(d)(1) with respect to the transfer of Taxpayer\nStock to the PI Trust.   \nAccordingly, based on the information submitted and representations made, we\nconclude that the PI Trust\u2019s initial basis in Taxpayer Stock is the fair market value of\nthat stock on the date Taxpayer transfers that stock to the PI Trust.1\n7\nPLR-114666-00\n2  We decline to rule on whether the payments are in fact excludable from the income of any\nparticular PI Claimant under \u00a7 104(a)(2), because we have no PI Claimant before us.  See section 2.01,\nRev. Proc. 2002-1, 2002-1 I.R.B. 1, 9.  \nRuling Request 6:  Is the PI Trust subject to the information reporting\nrequirements of \u00a7 6041 for payments it makes to PI Claimants?\nSection 6041(a) requires all persons engaged in a trade or business and making\npayment in the course of such trade or business to another person, of fixed or\ndeterminable gains, profits, and income of $600 or more in any taxable year to file an\ninformation return with respect to such payments. \nSection 1.6041-1(c) provides that income is fixed when it is to be paid in amounts\ndefinitely predetermined.  Income is determinable whenever there is a basis of\ncalculation by which the amount to be paid may be ascertained. \nSection 104(a)(2) provides that except in the case of amounts attributable to (and not in\nexcess of) deductions allowed under \u00a7 213 (relating to medical, etc., expenses) for any\nprior taxable year, gross income does not include the amount of any damages (other\nthan punitive damages) received (whether by suit or agreement and whether as lump\nsums or as periodic payments) on account of personal physical injuries or physical\nsickness.\nSection 1.468B-2(l)(2)(i) provides that payments and distributions made by a QSF are\nsubject to the information reporting requirements of Part III of Chapter 61 of the Code.  \nSection 1.468B-2(l)(2)(ii)(A) requires a QSF to file information returns on a distribution\nto a claimant if one or more transferors to the fund would have been required to make a\nreturn had that transferor made the distribution directly to the claimant. \nSection 1.468B-4 states that the determination whether a distribution to a claimant is\nincludible in the claimant's gross income is generally made by reference to the claim in\nrespect of which the distribution is made and as if the distribution were made directly by\nthe transferor. \nYou represent that all payments made by the PI Trust to PI Claimants will be made on\naccount of personal physical injuries under \u00a7 104(a)(2).  Accordingly, based on the\ninformation submitted and representations made, we conclude that the PI Trust is not\nrequired to file information returns under \u00a7 6041 for any payments it makes to the PI\nClaimants that are not subject to the tax benefit rule discussed below.2 \nPayments that would otherwise be excludable from gross income under \u00a7 104(a)(2) are\nincludible in income to the extent there was a prior tax benefit \u2013 that is, to the extent\nsuch payments are attributable to (and not in excess of) an individual's prior years\u2019\ndeductions allowed under \u00a7 213.  Even if such payments are taxable to the PI\nClaimants, however, the payments do not constitute fixed and determinable income\n8\nPLR-114666-00\nwithin the meaning of \u00a7 6041.  Because the PI Trust will neither find it practical to\nrequire PI Claimants to provide the PI Trust with prior-year tax returns nor otherwise\nhave access to those returns, the PI Trust will not have the information from which to\nascertain the extent (if any) of a prior-year medical expense deduction. \nAccordingly, based on the information submitted and representations made, we also\nconclude that the PI Trust is not required to file information returns under \u00a7 6041 with\nrespect to the portion of the payments it makes to PI Claimants attributable to (and not\nin excess of) the PI Claimants\u2019 \u00a7 213 deductions.   \nRULINGS REGARDING THE EFFECTS OF CERTAIN TRANSFERS ON TAXPAYER\nRuling Request 7:  Does \u00a7 1032 apply to Taxpayer\u2019s transfer of Taxpayer Stock to\nthe Unsecured Creditors, so that Taxpayer does not recognize any gain on that\ntransfer?\nSection 61(a)(3) provides that gross income includes gains derived from dealings in\nproperty.\nSection 1001(a) provides generally that gain or loss from the sale or other disposition of\nproperty is the difference between the amount realized and the basis of the property, as\ndetermined under \u00a7 1011. \nSection 1001(c) states that, except as otherwise provided in Subtitle A, the entire\namount of gain or loss determined under \u00a7 1001 on the sale or exchange of property\nshall be recognized. \nSection 1.468B-3(a)(1) provides that a transferor must treat a transfer of property to a\nQSF as a sale or exchange for purposes of \u00a7 1001(a), with the amount realized by the\ntransferor being the fair market value of the property on the date the transfer is made.\nSection 1032(a) provides that no gain or loss will be recognized to a corporation on the\nreceipt of money or other property in exchange for stock of such corporation.  Although\n\u00a7 1032 refers to an exchange for \u201cmoney or other property\u201d and does not expressly\nrefer to exchanges of stock for debt, it is generally acknowledged that \u00a7 1032 applies to\nan exchange of a corporation\u2019s stock for its debt, subject to \u00a7\u00a7 61(a)(12) and 108,\nwhich provide that a corporation may have income from cancellation of indebtedness\non an exchange of its stock for its own debt (that is, cancellation of indebtedness\nincome can be realized and recognized when debt is satisfied with stock of the debtor\ncorporation, even though no gain is recognized on the issuance of the stock).\nIn this case, Taxpayer will transfer d percent of its stock to the Unsecured Creditors, as\na result of which the Item-related tort and environmental claims held by those creditors\nwill be discharged under the bankruptcy statute.  In the case of the PI Claimants, the\ndischarge will occur as a result of the PI Trust\u2019s assumption of Taxpayer\u2019s Item-related\nliabilities.  In the case of the Environmental Claimants, the discharge will occur directly.  \n9\nPLR-114666-00\nAccordingly, based on the information submitted and representations made, we\nconclude that Taxpayer will not recognize any gain or loss on its stock in exchange for\nthe satisfaction of its debts to the PI Claimants, through the PI Trust, and the\nEnvironmental Claimants.\nRuling Request 8:  Will Taxpayer recognize gain or loss by entering into the Tax\nAgreement, under which it is obligated to transfer Tax Benefits in future years to\nthe Unsecured Creditors?\nAs just noted, a transfer of property (whether to a QSF or another person) in exchange\nfor money or other property generally is a sale or exchange \u2013 and thus a realization\nevent \u2013 under \u00a7\u00a7 1001(a) and 1.468B-3(a)(1).  However, \u00a7 1.468B-3(a)(1) also provides\nthat because the issuance of a transferor\u2019s debt, an obligation to provide services or\nproperty in the future, or an obligation to make a payment described in \u00a7 1.461-4(g) are\ngenerally not transfers of property by the transferor, the issuance of that debt or\nobligation generally does not result in gain or loss to the transferor under that section.\nSection 1.461-4(g)(2) pertains to liabilities requiring a payment or series of payments to\nanother person that arises under any workers compensation act or out of any tort,\nbreach of contract, or violation of law.  Under this provision, a liability arising out of a\ntort, breach of contract, or violation of law includes a liability arising out of a settlement\nof a dispute in which a tort, breach of contract, or violation of law is alleged.    \nBy entering into the Tax Agreement, Taxpayer has undertaken the obligation to pay\nfuture Tax Benefits to the Unsecured Creditors (through the QSF in the case of the PI\nClaimants).  Taxpayer\u2019s liability to the PI Claimants arises under alleged violations of\ntort law; its liability to the Environmental Claimants are based on alleged violations of\nfederal and state environmental law.  Thus, both types of claim are described in\n\u00a7 1.461-4(g).\nAccordingly, based on the information submitted and representations made, we\nconclude that Taxpayer will not realize any gain or loss under \u00a7 1001 as a result of\nentering into the Tax Agreement.  \nIn addition, when Taxpayer receives future-year tax refunds, you represent that\nTaxpayer will pay those refunds over in cash to fulfill its obligations under the Tax\nAgreement.  Accordingly, we conclude that these payments, if made in cash, will not\nconstitute a realization event under \u00a7 1001. \nRuling Request 9:  Is Taxpayer allowed a deduction under \u00a7 162 in the years it\ntransfers Taxpayer Stock, Available Cash, and cash arising from the Tax Benefits,\nto the PI Trust and the Environmental Claimants?\nSection 162(a) provides that there shall be allowed as a deduction all the ordinary and\nnecessary expenses paid or incurred during the taxable year in carrying on a trade or\nbusiness.  \n10\nPLR-114666-00\nSection 461(a) provides that a deduction shall be taken for the taxable year that is the\nproper taxable year under the method of accounting used in computing taxable income.\nSection 461(h)(1) provides that in determining whether an amount has been incurred\nwith respect to any item during any taxable year, the all events test shall not be treated\nas met any earlier than when economic performance with respect to the item occurs.\nSection 1.461-1(a)(2) provides that, under an accrual method of accounting, a liability is\nincurred, and generally is taken into account for federal income tax purposes, in the\ntaxable year in which all the events have occurred that establish the fact of the liability,\nthe amount of the liability can be determined with reasonable accuracy, and economic\nperformance has occurred with respect to the liability.\nSection 461(h)(2)(C) and (D) and \u00a7 1.461-4(g)(2) provide that with respect to liabilities\narising out of tort or a violation of law, economic performance occurs as payment is\nmade to the person to whom the liability is owed.\nSection 1.468B-3(c)(1) provides that for purposes of \u00a7 461(h), economic performance\noccurs with respect to a liability described in \u00a7 1.468B-1(c)(2) to the extent the\ntransferor makes a transfer to a QSF to resolve or satisfy the liability.  Liabilities\ndescribed in \u00a7 1.468B-1(c)(2) include tort liabilities.\nPayments made in settlement of a lawsuit or potential lawsuits are generally deductible\nunder \u00a7 162 if the acts that gave rise to the litigation were performed in the ordinary\nconduct of the taxpayer\u2019s business.  Here, Taxpayer\u2019s payments of damages to satisfy\nits tort liabilities for personal physical injuries caused by Item to PI Claimants are\nbusiness expenses under \u00a7 162.  In addition, Taxpayer\u2019s payments to the\nEnvironmental Claimants to settle Taxpayer\u2019s violation of federal and state\nenvironmental law liabilities, which will compensate those claimants for a portion of their\ncosts of performing environmental remediation at sites formerly owned by Taxpayer\u2019s\npredecessors in interest, are also business expenses under \u00a7 162. \nThe transfers of Taxpayer Stock, Tax Benefits, and Available Cash are deductible in the\nyears of transfer, because the all events and economic performance tests will be\nsatisfied in each of those years.  Both prongs of the all events test \u2013 the fact of\nTaxpayer\u2019s liability to both classes of claimants and the amount of that liability \u2013  were\nmet not later than date 5 (when the Bankruptcy Court approved the Plan).  Under\n\u00a7 1.461-4(g)(2), economic performance occurs with respect  to Taxpayer\u2019s liability to the\nEnvironmental Claimants when the transfers are made to those claimants.  Under\n\u00a7 1.468B-3, economic performance occurs with respect  to Taxpayer\u2019s liability to the PI\nClaimants as transfers are made to the PI Trust.  In addition, with respect to the transfer\nof Taxpayer Stock, you represent that Taxpayer has obtained a qualified appraisal as\nrequired by \u00a7 1.468B-3(b) and has met the requirements of \u00a7 1.468B-3(b)(2).\nTherefore, based on the information submitted and the representations made, we\nconclude that Taxpayer is allowed a deduction under \u00a7 162, in an amount equal to the\n11\nPLR-114666-00\nfair market value of Taxpayer Stock, in the taxable year during which that Taxpayer\nStock is transferred to the Environmental Claimants and the PI Trust.  Additionally,\nTaxpayer will be allowed a deduction under \u00a7 162(a) for the taxable years in which cash\npayments of Tax Benefits and Available Cash are made.\nRuling Request 10:  Will Taxpayer realize cancellation of indebtedness (COD)\nincome when the claims of the Unsecured Creditors are discharged? \nSection 61(a)(12) provides that gross income includes income from the discharge of\nindebtedness.  Such income (also known as cancellation of indebtedness income, or\nCOD income) is ordinary in nature and equals the difference between what is owed and\nwhat is actually paid to satisfy the liability.  COD income must generally be reported by\nthe debtor in the year the discharge occurs.\nSection 108(e)(2) provides that no income shall be realized from the discharge of\nindebtedness to the extent that payment of the liability would have given rise to a\ndeduction.        \nThe documentation submitted by Taxpayer suggests that, prior to the Plan\u2019s\nconsummation, a few of the Item-related tort and environmental claims against\nTaxpayer were liquidated.  To the extent those claims were discharged under the Plan\nfor amounts that were less than their face value, Taxpayer presumptively would have\ndischarge of indebtedness income under \u00a7 61(a)(12).  Preslar v. Commissioner, 167\nF.3d 1323, 1327-1328 (10th Cir. 1999).  However, because payment of the liquidated\nclaims would have given rise to a \u00a7 162(a) deduction (as discussed in Ruling Request\n9, above), the \u00a7 108(e)(2) exception applies.  Accordingly, Taxpayer did not realize\ndischarge of indebtedness income with respect to any liquidated claims that were\ndischarged under the Plan.\nThe great majority of the Item-related tort and environmental claims, however, were\nunliquidated prior to consummation of the Plan.  In the case of unliquidated claims \u2013\nthat is, in the case of claims in which the amount of debt owing is disputed \u2013 the\nsettlement of those claims does not give rise to discharge of indebtedness income. \nRather, if the dispute concerning the amount of the debt is in good faith, settlement of\nthe dispute is \u201c\u2018treated as the amount of debt cognizable for tax purposes.'\"  Preslar,\nsupra, at 1327, quoting from Zarin v. Commissioner, 916 F.2d 110, 115 (3rd Cir. 1990);\nFidelity & Columbia Trust Co. v. Lucas, 11 F.Supp 537 (W.D. Ky. 1935).  \nAccordingly, based on the information submitted and representations made, we\nconclude that Taxpayer did not realize discharge of indebtedness income from its\nsettlement of the Item-related tort and environmental claims. \nRuling Request 11:  Will Taxpayer\u2019s payments to the Unsecured Creditors qualify\nas specified liability losses under \u00a7 172(f)? \n12\nPLR-114666-00\nSection 172(a) allows a deduction for the taxable year an amount equal to the\naggregate of the (1) the net operating loss carryovers to such year, plus (2) the net\noperating loss carrybacks to such year.\nSection 172(b)(1)(C) provides that in the case of a taxpayer that has a specified liability\nloss (as defined in \u00a7 172(f)) for a taxable year, such specified liability loss shall be a net\noperating loss carryback to each of the 10 taxable years preceding the year of such\nloss.\nSection 172(f)(1)(A) and \u00a7 172(f)(1)(B) define the term \u201cspecified liability loss.\u201d  \nSection 172(f)(1)(A) defines a specified liability loss to mean any amount allowable as a\ndeduction under \u00a7162 or 165 for amounts which are attributable to product liability or\nexpenses incurred in investigating, settling, and opposing claims against the taxpayer\non account of product liability.\nSection 172(f)(4) provides that the term \u201cproduct liability\u201d includes (A) the liability of the\ntaxpayer for damages on account of physical injury or emotional harm to individuals on\naccount of any defect in any product that is manufactured, leased, or sold by the\ntaxpayer but only if (B) such injury or harm arises after the taxpayer has completed or\nterminated operations with respect to, and has relinquished possession of, such\nproduct.    \nSection 172(f)(1)(B)(i) defines a specified liability loss to include any amount allowable\nas  a deduction under Chapter 1 of Subtitle A of the Code (other than \u00a7 468(a)(1) or\n468A(a)) which is in satisfaction of a liability under a federal or state law requiring the\nremediation of environmental contamination.  Section 172(f)(1)(B)(ii) provides that a\nliability shall be taken into account under \u00a7 172(f)(1)(B) only if (i) the act (or failure to\nact) giving rise to such liability occurs at least three years before the beginning of the\ntaxable year, and (ii) the taxpayer used an accrual method of accounting throughout the\nperiod or periods during which such act (or failure to act) occurred.\nThe Item liability claims made by the PI Claimants are \u201cproduct liability\u201d claims because\nthey arose out the settlement of claims for physical injury to individuals due to exposure\nto Item, which Taxpayer\u2019s predecessor manufactured and sold, and which injuries arose\nafter Taxpayer\u2019s predecessor relinquished control of the items.       \nThe claims made by the Environmental Claimants are for environmental remediation\nrequired by federal and state law, and Taxpayer\u2019s (and/or Taxpayer\u2019s predecessor,\nCorporation\u2019s) act or failure to act arose from actions that occurred more than three\nyears before the taxable year of the transfer.  Moreover, Taxpayer has used an accrual\nmethod of accounting since its incorporation during date 1, and thus was on that\nmethod during any period or periods in which its act or failure to act occurred. \nAccordingly, based on the information submitted and representations made, we\nconclude that \u2013 \n13\nPLR-114666-00\n1. The transfers to the PI Claimants (through the PI Trust) of Taxpayer Stock, \nAvailable Cash, and Tax Benefits are specified liability losses within the meaning\nof \u00a7 172(f)(1), which therefore may be carried back to each of the 10 taxable\nyears preceding the year of such loss.    \n2. Taxpayer\u2019s transfers to the Environmental Claimants of Taxpayer Stock,\nAvailable Cash, and Tax Benefits to satisfy environmental remediation claims for\nSite 1 and Site 2 are specified liability losses within the meaning of \u00a7 172(f)(1), to\nthe extent that Corporation used the accrual method of accounting throughout\nany period or periods during which (determined separately for Site 1 and Site 2)\nan obligation was imposed upon Corporation for environmental remediation of\nthose sites under the earlier of \u2013 \n(a)\nfederal law (for example, the Comprehensive Environmental\nResponse, Compensation, and Liability Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 9601 et.\nseq.); or\n(b)\napplicable state law,\nTo the extent the above conditions are met, Taxpayer may carry back these\nlosses to each of the 10 taxable years preceding the year of such loss.\nRulingRequest12: Will Taxpayer\u2019s Carryforwards of its net operating losses be\nsubject to the loss limitation rules of \u00a7 382(b)?    \nSection 382 places limitations on the NOL carryforwards and certain built-in losses of a\nloss corporation that can be utilized following an ownership change in that loss\ncorporation.  Once \u00a7 382 is activated by a prescribed change-of-ownership event, the\nlimitation of \u00a7 382(a) takes hold and restricts the amount of the new loss corporation's\ntaxable income that can be offset by the taxpayer's net operating loss carryforwards in\ntaxable years after the change of ownership.  Section 382 limits the amount of income\nthat can be offset by the carryforwards to the \u201csection 382 limitation.\u201d\nHowever, \u00a7\u00a7 382(l)(5) and 1.382-9 prescribe special rules for corporations under the\njurisdiction of a bankruptcy court.  Section 382(l)(5)(A) provides that \u00a7 382(a) shall not\napply to an ownership change if (i) the old loss corporation is (immediately before the\nownership change) under the jurisdiction of the court in a title 11 or similar case, and (ii)\nthe shareholders and creditors of the old loss corporation (determined immediately\nbefore such ownership change) own (after such ownership change and as a result of\nbeing shareholders or creditors immediately before such change) 50 percent or more of\nthe stock, in vote and value, of the reorganized corporation.\nUnder \u00a7 1.382-9(d)(1), a \u201cqualified creditor\u201d is a beneficial owner, immediately before\nthe ownership change, of \u201cqualified indebtedness\u201d of the loss corporation.  These\nregulations also provide that a qualified creditor owns stock of the new loss corporation\nonly to the extent that the qualified creditor receives stock in full or partial satisfaction of\n14\nPLR-114666-00\nqualified indebtedness in a transaction ordered by the court or pursuant to a plan\napproved by the court in a title 11 or similar case.\nUnder \u00a7 1.382-9(d)(2)(i), indebtedness of the loss corporation is qualified indebtedness\nif it \u2013 \n(A)\nHas been owned by the same beneficial owner since the date that is 18\nmonths before the date of the filing of the title 11 or similar case; or\n(B)\nArose in the ordinary course of the trade or business of the loss\ncorporation and has been owned at all times by the same beneficial\nowner.  \nSection 1.382-9(d)(2)(ii) provides that beneficial ownership of indebtedness is\ndetermined without applying attribution rules.\nSection 1.382-9(d)(2)(iv) provides that \u201cordinary course indebtedness\u201d includes claims\narising out of a tort or breach of a statutory duty and indebtedness incurred with respect\nto expenses that would be deductible under \u00a7 162.\nSection 1.382-9(d)(5)(ii)(D) permits tacking of the holding period for a qualified transfer\nif the transferee\u2019s basis is determined under \u00a7\u00a7 1014 or 1015 or with reference to the\ntransferor's basis in the indebtedness.  Section 1014 provides basis rules for property\nheld by a person who acquired the property from a decedent or to whom the property\npassed from a decedent.\nTaxpayer has represented that the Environmental Claimants held their claims for more\nthan 18 months prior to the Chapter 11 filing, that they have been the only holders of\ntheir claims, and that the claims arose in the ordinary course of Taxpayer\u2019s business.\nAccordingly, based on the information submitted and representations made, we\nconclude that \u2013  \n1.  The Environmental Claimants will be qualified creditors of the old loss\ncorporation because they held qualified indebtedness of Taxpayer before the\nchange in ownership.\n2.  The PI Claimants will be considered qualified creditors of the old loss\ncorporation because they will be treated as directly owning Taxpayer stock\nplaced in the PI Trust as of the original date of transfer by Taxpayer (and thus of\nowning a \u201cdeemed stock interest\u201d).  \n3.  A PI Claimant will be considered to hold qualified indebtedness if that claimant (i)\nhas held the claim for more than 18 months prior to the Chapter 11 filing, or (ii) has\nbeen the only holder of the claim and the claim arose in the ordinary course of\nTaxpayer\u2019s business.\n15\nPLR-114666-00\n4.  Taxpayer\u2019s carryforwards of its NOLs will not become subject to the loss\nlimitation rules of \u00a7 382 if an individual receives a \u201cdeemed stock interest\u201d in the PI\nTrust from a deceased PI Claimant as long as all other requirements are fulfilled. \nSee \u00a7 1.382-9(d)(5)(ii)(D), which provides that a transfer from a decedent will be\nconsidered a qualified transfer.\nCAVEATS\nA copy of this letter must be attached to any income tax return to which it is relevant. \nWe enclose a copy of the letter for this purpose.

This letter responds to your request.\nThe information submitted and the representations made are summarized as\nfollows:  Decedent executed a will on a and a codicil to the will on b.  Decedent died in\nc, survived by Son 1, Son 2, and Daughter.  Decedent\u2019s will established the\nTestamentary Trust for the benefit of Decedent\u2019s descendants.\nThe relevant provisions of the Testamentary Trust are summarized as follows:\nDistribution of Income: \nThe trustees are to pay the net income from the Testamentary Trust quarterly, or\nmore often in their discretion, to Decedent\u2019s lineal descendants who are living at the\ntime of the distributions in equal shares per stirpes; provided, however, that in so far as\nthe same is not contrary to law the trustees are to accumulate the income that\notherwise would be payable to any person under the age of d years and thereupon add\nthe income to the corpus or principal of the Testamentary Trust.\nMultiply Trusts: \nIn order to facilitate their accounting, record keeping, and segregation of assets,\nthe trustees on receiving the Testamentary Trust property from Decedent\u2019s executors,\nare to create as many trusts as  there are at that time children  of Decedent living and\ndeceased children of Decedent who are then survived by descendants.  Wherever in\nDecedent\u2019s will Decedent provides for the designation of successor trustees by a\nmajority of the income beneficiaries who are adults with respect to the trust, it is\nDecedent\u2019s will that such action be effective only if taken by a majority of the adults\nthen entitled to receive income from the several trusts under Decedent\u2019s will ( or if only\n4\nPLR-117664-99\none such adult, then that one), and that the designation is to apply to each trust, to the\nend that at all times the same trustees are to act for each of the trusts.  \nTermination of Trust:\nThe Testamentary Trust is to terminate on the first to happen of the following two\nevents: (1)  e years after the death of the survivor among all of Decedent\u2019s lineal\ndescendants who are living at the time of Decedent\u2019s death, and (2) the death of the\nsurvivor among all of Decedent\u2019s lineal descendants regardless of when the lineal\ndescendants were born.\nDistribution on Termination:\nOn the final termination of the Testamentary Trust, the principal is to be paid to\nDecedent\u2019s then living lineal descendants in equal share per stirpes; or if at the time of\nthe termination of the Testamentary Trust Decedent has no lineal descendants then\nliving, the trustees are to pay, turn over, and deliver all of the Testamentary Trust\nproperty in their hands as follows: f thereof to Decedent\u2019s heirs at law according to the\nstatutes of descent and distribution of State as though Decedent had died on the date\nof the termination of the Testamentary Trust, and the remaining g thereof to Bank in\ntrust for Foundation.\nSuccessor Corporate Trustee:\nIn the event of the merger, consolidation, or sale of substantially all of its assets\nby Company to or with another bank or trust company authorized to carry on a trust\nbusiness, the merged, consolidated, or purchasing company thereupon is to become\nthe corporate trustee.\nSpouse or, if Spouse is then deceased or has renounced his right to name a\nsuccessor corporate trustee, a majority of the adults then entitled to receive income\nfrom the Testamentary Trust (or if only one, then that one) may at any time or times by\ninstrument in writing delivered to the then corporate trustee, name a successor\ncorporate trustee and may change any designation of a successor corporate trustee\npreviously made (prior to the time when the corporate trustee has become corporate\ntrustee of the Testamentary Trust); provided that the successor corporate trustee is a\nbank or trust company that is authorized to carry on a trust business in one or more\nstates of the United States and has a capital surplus and undivided profits of not less\nthan h.  In the event that the then corporate trustee resigns, is removed, or fails or\nceases to serve for any reason, the successor corporate trustee named in the manner\nprovided in this paragraph is to succeed to all the powers and duties of the original\ncorporate trustee.\nSuccessor Individual Trustee:\n5\nPLR-117664-99\nSpouse or, if Spouse is then deceased or has renounced his right to name a\nsuccessor individual trustee, a majority of the adults then entitled to receive income\nfrom the Testamentary Trust (or if only one, then that one) may at any time or times by\ninstrument in writing delivered to the then individual trustee, name a successor\nindividual trustee and may change any designation of a successor individual trustee\npreviously made (prior to the time when the individual trustee has become individual\ntrustee of the Testamentary Trust).  In the event that the then individual trustee resigns,\nis removed, or fails or ceases to serve for any reason, the successor individual trustee\nnamed in the manner provided in this paragraph is to succeed to all the powers and\nduties of the original individual trustee.\nIf no successor individual trustee is named\npursuant to the provisions of this paragraph, the corporate trustee is to serve as the\nsole trustee with all the powers and duties provided for the trustee until such time as an\nindividual trustee is named pursuant to this paragraph to serve with the corporate\ntrustee.\nSince the initial funding of the Testamentary Trust, it has been administered as\nthree separate trusts:   (1) Trust A for the benefit of Son 1 and his descendants; \n(2) Trust B for the benefit of Son 2 and his descendants, and (3) Trust C for the benefit\nof Daughter and her descendants (collectively the Trusts).  Each Trust has its own\ntaxpayer identification number and files its own fiduciary income tax return.\nSon 1 died in i and his children, Grandson and Granddaughter, currently receive\nthe income from Trust A by representation.  Each of Grandson and Granddaughter has\nreached the age of d, therefore, no Trust A income is currently being accumulated.\nOver the years the relationships among the income beneficiaries of the Trusts\nhave deteriorated.  Until j, the Trusts were administered by the same corporate trustee. \nThe income beneficiaries of the Trusts requested the resignation of the corporate\ntrustee, but could not come to a majority agreement concerning the naming of a\nsuccessor corporate trustee.  Because, Decedent\u2019s will does not authorize the income\nbeneficiaries to name a different corporate trustee for each separate Trust, the trustees\npetitioned the Court to give each income beneficiary the power to name a separate\nsuccessor corporate trustee for his or her separate Trust.  In addition, the trustees\npetitioned the Court to divide Trust A between the income beneficiaries, Grandson and\nGranddaughter.  The petition also requested the clarification of the terms by which the\nsuccessor trustees would distribute the Trusts\u2019 assets on their termination.\nOn k, the Court issued an order (Court Order) dividing Trust A between\nGrandson and Granddaughter and allowing the income beneficiary of each Trust to\nappoint a separate successor trustee for his or her respective Trust.  In addition, the\nCourt ordered that until its termination, the Testamentary Trust is to consist of four\nseparate Trusts: (1) Trust B for the benefit of Son 2 and his descendants; (2) Trust C\nfor the benefit of Daughter and her descendants; (3) Trust D  for the benefit of\nGrandson and his descendants; and (4) Trust E for the benefit of Granddaughter and\n6\nPLR-117664-99\nher descendants.  Until these Trusts terminate, each successor trustee is to administer\na Trust by making current income distributions only to the income beneficiary or his or\nher respective living lineal descendants, per stirpes. \nIt is represented that following the Court Order, it became apparent that the\nterms for distribution prior to the Trust\u2019s termination also needed clarification.  All\ninterested parties entered into Consent and Stipulation as to Terms Governing the\nDistribution of Trust Assets (Consent and Stipulation).  The Court approved the\nConsent and Stipulation on l.  \nParagraph 1 of the Consent and Stipulation provides that each of Trust B and\nTrust C (collectively, the Separate Trusts), and Trust D, and Trust E (collectively, the\nSub-Trusts) will terminate at the same time on the first to occur of the following events:\n(a) e years after the death of the survivor between Son 2 and Daughter, or (b) the death\nof the survivor among all of Decedent\u2019s lineal descendants.  \nParagraph 2 of the Consent and Stipulation provides that on the final\ntermination, the assets of each of each Separate Trust and each Sub-Trust are to\nremain separated along the family lines of Decedent\u2019s children, except as otherwise\nspecifically provided in the Consent and Stipulation.  \nParagraph 3 of the Consent and Stipulation provides that on final termination,\nthe balance of the assets in each Separate Trust is to be distributed per stirpes to the\nthen-living descendants of the child of Decedent for whose benefit the Separate Trust\nwas created.\nUnder Paragraph 4 of the Consent and Stipulation, on final termination, the\nbalance of the assets in each Sub-Trust is to be distributed to the income beneficiary of\nthe Sub-Trust.  In the event that the income beneficiary is not then living, the balance of\nthe assets is to be distributed to the deceased income beneficiary\u2019s then-living\ndescendants per stirpes, or if none, the assets are to be distributed per stirpes among\nthe then-living descendants of the deceased income beneficiary\u2019s nearest lineal\nancestor who was a descendant of Decedent and who has one or more then-living\ndescendants.  In the event a Sub-Trust has more than one income beneficiary, the\nbalance of the assets in the Sub-Trust is to be distributed per stirpes to the then-living\nlineal descendants of the beneficiary for whose benefit the Sub-Trust was created.  \nParagraph 5 of the Consent and Stipulation provides that on the final\ntermination, in the event that a child of Decedent has no living lineal descendants, the\nbalance of the assets in that child\u2019s Separate trust, or a Sub-trust created therefrom, as\nthe case may be, is to be distributed to the then-living descendants of Decedent per\nstirpes. \n7\nPLR-117664-99\nParagraph 6 of the Consent and Stipulation provides that in the event that no\nlineal descendants of Decedent are living on the final termination, all Trust assets are to\nbe distributed pursuant to the \u201cDistribution on Termination\u201d section of the Testamentary\nTrust.\nParagraph 8 of the Consent and Stipulation provides that prior to the final\ntermination, the trustee is to pay the income from a Separate Trust semiannually (or\nmore often in its discretion) to the child of Decedent for whom the Separate Trust was\ncreated.  \nParagraph 9 of the Consent and Stipulation provides that after the death of a\nchild of Decedent, the trustee is to pay the income from the Separate Trust\nsemiannually (or more often in its discretion) to the lineal descendants of the child who\nare living at the time of the respective distributions, per stirpes, subject to the\n\u201cAccumulation of Income\u201d section of the Testamentary Trust.  Notwithstanding the\nforegoing, if\n(a)\none or more of the descendants of a deceased child request the trustee to \ndivide the Separate Trust into sub-trusts for the descendants,\n(b)\nthe trustee in its discretion considers it advisable to make such a division,\nand\n(c)\nthe Internal Revenue Service issues a favorable private letter ruling\ndetermining that such a division will not cause the Trust to lose its\n\u201cgrandfathered\u201d exemption from the federal generation-skipping transfer\ntax,\nthen the trustee in its discretion may divide the Separate Trust per stirpes among the\nthen-living descendants of the deceased child.  Each share created for a descendant is\nto be held and administered as a sub-trust for the benefit of that descendant.\nParagraph 10 of the Consent and Stipulation provides that in the event that, prior\nto final termination, any Separate Trust ceases to have a current income beneficiary\n(e.g., a Separate Trust\u2019s sole beneficiary dies without then-living lineal descendants)\nthe balance of such Trust\u2019s assets is to be divided per stirpes among the then-living\nlineal descendants of Decedent and the share of such descendant is to be transferred\nto the Separate Trust or Sub-Trust benefitting the descendant.\nParagraph 11 of the Consent and Stipulation provides that the trustee is to pay\nthe income from a Sub-Trust semiannually (or more often in its discretion) to the\ndescendant of Decedent for whom the Sub-Trust was created.  \n8\nPLR-117664-99\nParagraph 12 provides that after the death of the descendant, the trustee is to\npay the income from a Sub-Trust semiannually (or more often in its discretion) to the\nlineal descendants of the deceased descendant who are living at the time of the\nrespective distributions, per stirpes, subject to the \u201cAccumulation of Income\u201d section of\nthe Testamentary Trust.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if\n(d)\none or more of the descendants of a deceased descendant request the\ntrustee to  divide the Sub-Trust into further sub-trusts for the descendants,\n(e)\nthe trustee in its discretion considers it advisable to make such a division,\nand\n(f)\nthe Internal Revenue Service issues a favorable private letter ruling\ndetermining that such a division will not cause the Trust to lose its\n\u201cgrandfathered\u201d exemption from the federal generation-skipping transfer\ntax,\nthen the trustee in its discretion may divide the Sub-Trust per stirpes among the\nthen-living descendants of the deceased descendant.  Each share created for a\ndescendant is to be held and administered as a sub-trust for the benefit of such \nthen-living descendant.\nParagraph 13 of the Consent and Stipulation provides that in the event that, prior\nto final termination, a Sub-Trust ceases to have a current income beneficiary (e.g., a\nSub-Trust\u2019s sole income beneficiary dies without then-living lineal descendants) the\nbalance of the assets of the Sub-Trust is to be divided per stirpes among the\nthen-living descendants of the deceased income beneficiary\u2019s nearest lineal ancestor\nwho was a descendant of Decedent and who has one or more then-living descendants,\nor if none, per stirpes among the then-living lineal descendants of Decedent.  Each\nshare created for a then-living descendant is to be transferred to the Separate Trust or\nSub-Trust benefitting the descendant.\nParagraph 14 of the Consent and Stipulation provides that each Separate Trust\nand each Sub-Trust need not have the same trustee.\nIt is represented that the Testamentary Trust was irrevocable on September 25,\n1985, and there have been no additions (actual or constructive) to it since that date.\nYou have requested the following rulings:\n1.  The proposed partition of Trust A will into two Sub-Trusts for the benefit of\nGrandson and Granddaughter will not cause the resulting Sub-Trusts to be subject to\nthe GST tax.\n9\nPLR-117664-99\n2. The modification and clarification of the administrative provisions of the\nTestamentary Trust will not cause Trust A, Trust B, or Trust C to be subject to the GST\ntax.\nSection 2601 of the Internal Revenue Code imposes a tax on every \ngeneration-skipping transfer made by the \"transferor\" to a \"skip-person.\"\nSection 26.2601-1(b)(1)(i) of the Generation-Skipping Transfer Tax Regulations\nprovides that the tax does not apply to any generation-skipping transfer under a trust\n(as defined in \u00a7 2652(b)) that was irrevocable on September 25, 1985.  The rule of the\npreceding sentence does not apply to a pro rata portion of any generation-skipping\ntransfer under an irrevocable trust if additions are made to the trust after \nSeptember 25, 1985.\nSection 26.2601-1(b)(1)(ii) provides that, except as provided in \n\u00a7 26.2601-1(b)(1)(ii)(B) or (C), any trust in existence on September 25, 1985, is\nconsidered an irrevocable trust.\nSection 2611(a) defines the term \"generation-skipping transfer\" to mean:   (1) a\ntaxable distribution, (2) a taxable termination, and (3) a direct skip.\nSection 26.2611-1 provides that a generation-skipping transfer is an event that is\neither a direct skip, a taxable distribution, or a taxable termination.  The determination\nas to whether an event is a generation-skipping transfer is made by reference to the\nmost recent transfer subject to the estate or gift tax.\nSection 2612(c)(1) defines the term \"direct skip\" to mean a transfer subject to a\ntax imposed by chapter 11 or 12 of an interest in property to a skip person.\nSection 2613(a) defines the term \"skip person\" to mean -- \n(1) a natural person assigned to a generation that is two or more generations\nbelow the generation assignment of the transferor, or\n     \n(2) a trust --\n     \n        \n(A) if all interests in such trust are held by skip persons, or       \n        \n(B) if --\n           \n (i) there is no person holding an interest in the trust, and\n(ii) at no time after the transfer may a distribution (including\ndistributions on termination) be made from the trust to a non-skip person.\n10\nPLR-117664-99\nThe Testamentary Trust is a generation-skipping trust because it provides for\ndistributions to more than one generation of beneficiaries below Decedent\u2019s generation. \nThe Testamentary Trust, however, has been exempt from the GST tax pursuant to  \n\u00a7 26.2601-1(b)(1)(i) because it was irrevocable on September 25, 1985, and there have\nbeen no additions (actual or constructive ) to it since that date.  You have requested a\nruling that the partition of Trust A into Sub-Trusts for the benefit of Grandson and\nGranddaughter and the proposed modification of the provision relating to the\nappointment of successor individual trustees of the Testamentary Trust will not cause\nTrust A, Trust B, or Trust C to be subject to the GST tax.\nAn amendment to a trust that was irrevocable on September 25, 1985, and, thus,\nis exempt from the GST tax, will cause the trust to lose its exemption if the amendment\nmodifies or otherwise changes the quality, value, or timing of any of the powers,\nbeneficial interests, rights, or expectancies originally provided under the terms of the\ntrust.  A trust's exemption from the GST tax is not affected, however, by amendments\nrelating to the administration of a trust.\nBased on the information submitted and the representations made, the interests\nof the income beneficiaries under the division of Trust A, will remain the same and the\ntiming of the termination of the Sub-Trusts will remain the same.  Consequently, the\nvalue of the income or corpus interest of each income beneficiary will not change\nmaterially as a result of the division of Trust A into two separately administered \nSub-Trusts.  Therefore, the division of Trust A into two Sub-Trusts will not change the\nquality, value, or timing of any powers, beneficial interests, rights, or expectancies\noriginally provided for under the terms of the Testamentary Trust.  Accordingly, we\nconclude that the division of Trust A into two Sub-Trusts will not cause distributions\nfrom the Sub-Trusts to be subject to GST tax imposed by chapter 13, provided that no\nadditions are made to the Sub-Trusts after September 25, 1985.  \nIn addition, we conclude that the modification and clarification of the Separate\nTrust and the Sub-Trusts relates to the administration of those Trusts and will not\nmodify or otherwise change the quality, value, or timing of any of the powers, beneficial\ninterests, rights, or expectancies originally provided under the terms of the Trust. \nAccordingly, neither distributions from the Separate Trusts or the Sub-Trusts to skip\npersons nor terminations of interests of non-skip persons in the Separate Trusts or\nSub-Trusts will be subject to the GST tax.\nExcept as ruled above, we express or imply no opinion  concerning the federal\ntax consequences of this transaction under the cited provisions or any other provision of\nthe Code.  \nThis ruling is directed only to the taxpayer who requested it.  Section 6110(j)(3)\nprovides that it may not be used or cited as precedent. \n11\nPLR-117664-99\nIn accordance with the power of attorney on file with this office, we are sending a\ncopy of this letter to your authorized representative.\n                                           Sincerely yours,\nJoseph H.

The information \nsubmitted in that letter and in later correspondence is summarized below.  \nThe rulings contained in this letter are based on facts and representations \nsubmitted by the taxpayers and accompanied by penalties of perjury statements \nexecuted by the appropriate parties.  This office has not verified any of the materials \nsubmitted in support of the request for rulings.  Verification of the information, \nrepresentations, and other data may be required as part of the audit. \n \nSummary of Facts \n \nCorp A is a nonstock not-for-profit corporation that is the common parent of a \ngroup that files a consolidated federal income tax return.  Corp A derives its revenues \nprimarily from Business A.   \n \nAs a nonstock corporation, Corp A does not have authorized capital stock; rather, \nparticipation in Corp A is obtained through Membership Interests held by Members.  \nEach Corp A Membership Interest is comprised of a Corp A Trading Right and Equity \nInterest. The Corp A Trading Right represents certain rights and privileges that entitles \nits holder to access certain facilities of Corp A to engage in Business A.  The Equity \nInterest allows the Member to elect directors and to vote on any other matter at any \nmeeting of Corp A Members, and to share equally with other Members in any liquidating \ndistribution in the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution, or \nwinding up of Corp A\u2019s affairs.  Members and certain other individuals may also hold \nlimited rights, as expressly provided for in the bylaws and the rules of Corp A, to engage \nin specified trading activities associated with Business A (the \u201cCorp A Trading Permits\u201d). \n \nPLR-149672-06 \n \n \n3 \nCorp B is a publicly traded corporation that engages in Business B.  Corp B \nwholly owns Merger Sub.  Merger Sub was recently formed in order to effectuate certain \nsteps of the proposed transaction.   \nCorp A, Corp B, and Merger Sub are parties to an agreement and plan of merger \ndated as of Date A, amended as of Date B (collectively, the \u201cAgreement\u201d).  The \nAgreement provides for certain transactions that are intended to culminate in the \ncombination of Corp A and Corp B.   \n \nProposed Transaction \n \n \nTo effectuate the combination, the following steps (collectively, the \u201cProposed \nTransaction\u201d) will occur in the order listed: \n \n(1) \nIn the Merger, Corp A will merge with and into Merger Sub.  Merger Sub will be \nthe surviving corporation (\u201cSurviving Corp\u201d) and the separate corporate existence of \nCorp A will cease.  Surviving Corp will continue to be a wholly owned subsidiary of  \nCorp B.   \n(2) \nAt the effective time of the Merger (the \u201cEffective Time\u201d), each outstanding Equity \nInterest will be converted into the right to receive, at the election of the holder of such \nEquity Interest, either: \n(i) \nStock Consideration \n(A) a shares of newly issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares of Corp \nB Common Stock, plus  \n(B) the right to receive, in cash from Corp B based on x (the \u201cExcess \nConsideration\u201d), if any, plus \n(C) an amount equal to the amount of cash and shares of Corp B \nCommon Stock allocated to a bonus pool for certain directors and \nemployees of Corp A (the \u201cBonus Pool\u201d) that is in fact not paid to such \ndirectors or employees divided by the number of Equity Interests as of the \nEffective Time (the \u201cAdditional Consideration\u201d), if any; or \n(ii) \nCash Consideration \n(A) the right to receive an amount of cash from Corp B equal to b, plus  \n(B) the right to receive the Excess Consideration, if any, plus  \n \nPLR-149672-06 \n \n \n4 \n(C) the Additional Consideration, if any. \nThere will be no dissenters to the transaction.  Cash will be paid in lieu of any \nfractional shares of Corp B Common Stock. \n(3) \nThe total Merger Consideration in the transaction will be comprised of Stock \nConsideration and Cash Consideration.  All Excess Consideration will be paid in cash \nby Corp B, except to the extent such Excess Consideration must be paid in shares of \nCorp B Common Stock as necessary to cause the Merger to be treated as a \nreorganization under section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code.  The remaining \nMerger Consideration, which is all of the Merger Consideration other than Excess \nConsideration in cash, will be paid in the relative proportions, based on each Member\u2019s \nelection of cash and/or shares of Corp B Common Stock, subject to the certain \nlimitations, including the following: the sum of (A) the total aggregate Cash \nConsideration paid to Members (excluding any Excess Consideration paid to Members \nin cash), plus the aggregate cash paid in lieu of fractional shares, and (B) the portion of \nthe Bonus Pool that is paid in cash to Corp A employees and directors may not exceed \n$c.  Based on a calculation of the Merger Consideration on Date A, this amount of Cash \nConsideration represents approximately ------ of the Merger Consideration.   \n(4) \nAt the Effective Time,  \n(i) each Corp A Trading Right will become solely the right to access the facilities \nto engage in the trading rights and privileges associated with Business A as \noperated by Surviving Corp (a \u201cSurviving Corp Trading Right\u201d); and  \n(ii) each Corp A Trading Permit will become solely the right to engage in \nspecified trading activities associated with Business A as operated by Surviving \nCorp (a \u201cSurviving Corp Trading Permit\u201d).   \nThe Surviving Corp Trading Rights will have rights that do not differ materially \nfrom the Corp A Trading Rights and the Surviving Corp Trading Permits will have rights \nthat will not differ materially from the Corp A Trading Permits. \nRepresentations \n \nThe following representations have been made regarding the Proposed \nTransaction: \n(a) \nThe fair market value of the Corp B Common Stock and cash from Corp B \nreceived by each Corp A Member in the Proposed Transaction will be approximately \nequal to the fair market value of the Corp A Equity Interests surrendered in exchange \ntherefor. \n \n \nPLR-149672-06 \n \n \n5 \n(b) \nAt the time of the Proposed Transaction, Corp A will not have outstanding \nany warrants, options, convertible securities, or any type of right pursuant to which any \nperson could acquire Corp A Equity Interests. \n \n(c) \nAt least 40% of the proprietary interest in Corp A will be exchanged for \nCorp B Common Stock and will be preserved (within the meaning of Treas. Reg.          \nsection 1.368-1(e)). \n \n(d) \nNeither Corp B nor any person related to Corp B (within the meaning of \nsection 1.368-1(e)(3)) has any plan or intention to reacquire any Corp B Common \nStock issued in the transaction to Corp A Members in exchange for any consideration \nother than Corp B Common Stock. \n \n(e) \nSurviving Corp will acquire at least 90% of the fair market value of the net \nassets and at least 70% of the fair market value of the gross assets held by Corp A \nimmediately prior to the Proposed Transaction.  For purposes of this representation, \namounts paid by Corp A to its Members who receive cash or other property, Corp A \nassets used to pay its reorganization expenses, and all redemptions and distributions \nmade by Corp A immediately preceding the Proposed Transaction will be included as \nassets of Corp A held immediately prior to the Proposed Transaction. \n \n(f) \nPrior to the Proposed Transaction, Corp B will be in control of Surviving \nCorp within the meaning of section 368(c) of the Code. \n \n(g) \nFollowing the Proposed Transaction, Surviving Corp will not issue \nadditional shares of its stock that would result in Corp B losing control of Surviving Corp \nwithin the meaning of section 368(c). \n \n(h) \nCorp B has no plan or intention to reacquire any of its stock issued in the \nProposed Transaction. \n \n(i) \nNeither Corp B nor any of its affiliates has any plan or intention to liquidate \nSurviving Corp, to merge Surviving Corp with or into another corporation, or to sell or \notherwise transfer or dispose of any of the assets of Corp A acquired in the Proposed \nTransaction, except for transfers or dispositions made in the ordinary course of \nbusiness or transfers described in section 368(a)(2)(C) and section 1.368-2(k). \n \n(j) \nThe liabilities of Corp A assumed by Surviving Corp and the liabilities to \nwhich the Corp A assets are subject were incurred by Corp A in the ordinary course of \nits business and are associated with the assets transferred. \n \n(k) \nFollowing the Proposed Transaction, Surviving Corp will continue the \nhistoric business of Corp A within the meaning of section 1.368-1(d). \n \n \nPLR-149672-06 \n \n \n6 \n(l) \nEach of Corp A, Corp B, Surviving Corp, and the Corp A Members will pay \ntheir respective expenses, if any, incurred in connection with the Proposed Transaction, \nexcept that (i) Surviving Corp shall pay all property and transfer taxes imposed in \nconnection with the Proposed Transaction, and (ii) expenses incurred in connection \nwith the filing, printing, and mailing of the proxy statement and the registration \nstatement will be shared equally by Corp A and Corp B. \n \n(m) \nThere is no intercorporate indebtedness existing between Corp A and \nCorp B or between Surviving Corp and Corp A that was issued, acquired, or will be \nsettled at discount. \n \n(n) \nNone of Corp A, Corp B, or Surviving Corp is an investment company as \ndefined in section 368(a)(2)(F)(iii) and (iv). \n \n(o) \nCorp A is not under the jurisdiction of a court in a Title 11 or similar case \nwithin the meaning of section 368(a)(3)(A). \n \n(p) \nNone of the compensation received by any Corp A Member who is also an \nemployee of Corp A (a \u201cMember-employee\u201d) will be separate consideration for, or \nallocable to, any of their Equity Interests and none of the shares of Corp B Common \nStock received by any Member-employee in the Proposed Transaction will be separate \nconsideration for, or allocable to, any employment agreement. \n \n(q) \nThe fair market value of the assets of Corp A transferred to Surviving Corp \nwill equal or exceed the sum of the liabilities assumed by Surviving Corp, plus the \namount of liabilities, if any, to which the Corp A assets are subject. \n \n(r) \nNo equity interests of Surviving Corp will be issued in the Proposed \nTransaction. \n \n(s) \nThe distribution of cash in lieu of fractional shares of Corp B Common \nStock is undertaken solely for the purpose of saving Corp B the expense and \ninconvenience of issuing and transferring fractional shares and is not separately \nbargained-for consideration.   \n \n(t) \nCorp A, Corp B, and Surviving Corp will report the Proposed Transaction \nin compliance with section 1.368-3T(a). \n \nRulings \n \nBased solely on the information submitted and the representations set forth \nabove, we rule as follows regarding the Proposed Transaction. \n \n \nPLR-149672-06 \n \n \n7 \n(1) \nProvided that the Merger qualifies as a statutory merger in accordance \nwith applicable State law, the Merger, as described above, will qualify as a \nreorganization within the meaning of sections 368(a)(1)(A) and 368(a)(2)(D) of the \nCode.  Corp A, Corp B, and Surviving Corp will each be \u201ca party to a reorganization\u201d \nwithin the meaning of section 368(b). \n \n(2) \nNo gain or loss will be recognized by Corp A upon the transfer of Corp A \nassets to Surviving Corp in exchange for Corp B Common Stock, cash, and the \nassumption of Corp A liabilities by Surviving Corp (sections 361(b) and 357(a)). \n \n(3) \nNo gain or loss will be recognized by Corp B and Surviving Corp on the \nreceipt by Surviving Corp of the assets of Corp A in exchange for Corp B Common \nStock, cash, and the assumption by Surviving Corp of the liabilities of Corp A (Rev. Rul. \n57-278, 1957-1 C.B. 124). \n \n(4) \nThe basis of the assets of Corp A acquired by Surviving Corp will be the \nsame as the basis of such assets in the hands of Corp A immediately prior to the \nProposed Transaction (section 362(b)). \n \n(5) \nThe holding period of the assets of Corp A in the hands of Surviving Corp \nwill include the period during which such assets were held by Corp A (section 1223(2)). \n \n(6) \nNo gain or loss will be recognized by the Corp A Members on the receipt \nof solely Corp B Common Stock in exchange for their Corp A Equity Interests in the \nProposed Transaction (section 354(a)). \n \n(7) \nThe basis of the Corp B Common Stock received by the Corp A Members \nwill be the same as the basis of the Corp A Equity Interest surrendered in exchange \ntherefor (section 358(a)). \n \n(8) \nGain, if any, will be recognized by Corp A Members upon the receipt of \nCorp B Common Stock and cash in the Proposed Transaction, but in an amount not in \nexcess of the cash received (section 356(a)(1)).  If the exchange has the effect of the \ndistribution of a dividend (determined with the application of section 318(a)), then the \namount of the gain recognized that is not in excess of the Corp A Member\u2019s ratable \nshare of undistributed earnings and profits will be treated as a dividend (section \n356(a)(2)).

The information submitted in that request is \nsummarized below.\nThe rulings contained in this letter are based on facts and representations \nsubmitted by the taxpayer and accompanied by a penalty of perjury statement executed \nby an appropriate party.  This office has not verified any of the materials submitted in \nsupport of the request for rulings.  Verification of the information, representations, and \nother data may be required as part of the audit process.\nSUMMARY OF FACTS\nParent is the common parent of an affiliated group of corporations (the \u201cParent \nGroup\u201d) that files a consolidated return for Federal income tax purposes.  All members \nof the consolidated group use the accrual method of accounting. Parent, through its \nsubsidiaries, is engaged in Business A. \nParent indirectly owns all of the outstanding stock of Successor Sub 1.  \nSuccessor Sub 1 owns all of the outstanding stock of Successor Sub 2.  Successor Sub \n2 owns all of the outstanding stock of Target Sub 1.  Target Sub 1 owns all of the \noutstanding stock of Successor Sub 3, Target Sub 2, and Target Sub 3.  Successor Sub \n3 owns all of the outstanding stock of Target Sub 4.  Target Sub 4 owns all of the \noutstanding stock of Successor Sub 4.  Successor Sub 4 owns all of the outstanding \nstock of Successor Sub 5 and Target Sub 5. \nAs a result of past restructurings, Successor Sub 1, Successor Sub 2, Successor \nSub 3, Successor Sub 4, and Successor Sub 5 are accounting for intercompany gains \nunder the rules of \u00a71.1502-13.  The relevant intercompany gains were recognized as a \nresult of the distribution of assets in Year A by a former member of Parent Group to \nmultiple group members in a liquidation to which Sections 332 and 336(a) applied (\u201cthe \nYear A Liquidation\u201d).  Successor Sub 1, Successor Sub 2, Successor Sub 3, Successor \nSub 4, and Successor Sub 5 are successors to those gains in accordance with \n\u00a7 1.1502-13(j)(2)(i)(A).\nThe assets distributed in the Year A Liquidation consisted of stock of subsidiaries \nwithin Parent Group.  The stock of two of those subsidiaries were disposed of in Year B \nand Year C and the intercompany gains associated with the Year A distribution of that \nstock was taken into account (\u201cthe Prior Dispositions\u201d).  The intercompany gains  from \nthe Year A Liquidation with respect to the stock of other subsidiaries has not been taken \ninto account and those intercompany gains are reflected in  blocks of stock of Target \nSub 1, Target Sub 2, Target Sub 3, Target Sub 4, Successor Sub 3, Successor Sub 4, \nSuccessor Sub 5 and Target Sub 5.\nPLR-148291-12\n4\nPROPOSED TRANSACTIONS\nParent proposes to effect the following partially consummated transactions, on or \nprior to Date C: \n(i)\nOn Date A, Successor Sub 4 formed New Successor Sub 5.  \n(ii)\nOn or before Date B, Successor Sub 5 will merge with and into New \nSuccessor Sub 5.\n(iii)\nOn Date C, New Successor Sub 5 will convert into a limited liability company \n(\u201cLLC\u201d) under State A law.  \n(iv)\nOn Date C, Successor Sub 4 will merge with and into Target Sub 4.  \n(v)\nOn Date C, Target Sub 4 will merge with and into Successor Sub 3.  \n(vi)\nOn Date C, Successor Sub 3 will convert to an LLC under State B law. \n(vii)\nOn Date C, Target Sub 2 will convert to an LLC under State A law.    \n(viii)\nOn Date C, Target Sub 1 will convert to an LLC under State A law.    \n(ix)\nOn Date C, Successor Sub 2 will convert into an LLC under State A law.    \nFollowing completion of the Proposed Transactions, Target Sub 5 and Target \nSub 3 will remain in existence as direct subsidiaries of Successor Sub 1 for U.S. federal \ntax purposes.  \nREPRESENTATIONS\nThe following representations have been made by Parent: \n(a) Section 332 applied to the Year A Liquidation by reason of \u00a7 1.1502-34; \nhowever, there was not an 80-percent distributee as defined in Section 337(c).\n(b) Successor Sub 1, Successor Sub 2, Successor Sub 3, Successor Sub 4, and \nSuccessor Sub 5 are successor persons (as defined in \u00a7 1.1502-13(j)(2)) to the \nintercompany gain recognized as a result of the Year A Liquidation.  There are \nno other successors (as defined in \u00a7 1.1502-13(j)(2)) to the intercompany gain \nfrom the Year A Liquidation.\nPLR-148291-12\n5\n(c) The stock of each of Target Sub 1, Target Sub 2, Target Sub 3, Target Sub 4, \nSuccessor Sub 3, Successor Sub 4, Successor Sub 5, and Target Sub 5 was \ndistributed in the Year A Liquidation or is considered a successor asset (as \ndefined in \u00a7 1.1502-13(j)(1)) to stock distributed in the Year A Liquidation.  \n(d) Proposed Transactions (i) and (ii) will, together, qualify as a reorganization under \nSection 368(a)(1)(F), and New Successor Sub 5 stock will be a successor asset \nto Successor Sub 5 stock with respect to the Year A Liquidation under \u00a7 1.1502-\n13(j)(1).\n(e) Proposed Transactions (iii) through (ix) will each qualify as a nontaxable \nliquidation under Sections 332 and 337(a), or as a reorganization under Section \n368(a)(1)(A) or Section 368(a)(1)(C).  As such, the respective shareholders\u2019 \nbases in the affected subsidiaries will be permanently eliminated and there will \nnot be a successor asset to which such bases attach.\n(f) Following the conversions of New Successor Sub 5, Successor Sub 3, Target \nSub 2, Target Sub 1, and Successor Sub 2 to LLCs in Proposed Transactions \n(iii), (vi), (vii), (viii), and (ix), respectively, each will be treated as a disregarded \nentity for U.S. federal income tax purposes.  There is no current plan or intention \nfor any of these entities to elect to be classified as an association taxable as a \ncorporation for U.S. federal tax purposes.\n(g) Other than the intercompany gains taken into account as a result of each of the \nPrior Dispositions, the effects of each intercompany transaction that resulted \nfrom the Year A Liquidation have not previously been reflected on the Parent \nGroup's consolidated return.\n(h) The Parent Group has not derived, and no taxpayer will derive, any federal \nincome tax benefit from the Year A Liquidation that gave rise to the intercompany \ngains or the redetermination of the intercompany gains (including any adjustment \nto basis in member stock under \u00a7 1.1502-32).\nRULINGS\nBased solely on the facts and representations submitted, we rule as follows: \n(1) Except as provided in Ruling (3) below, ,the remaining intercompany gains from \nthe Year A Liquidation .will be redetermined to be excluded from gross income \nunder the Commissioner\u2019s Discretionary Rule of \u00a7 1.1502-13(c)(6)(ii)(D).  \n(2) The intercompany gain that is redetermined to be excluded from gross income \nwill not be taken into account as earnings and profits of any member and will not \nbe treated as tax-exempt income under \u00a7 1.1502-32(b)(2)(ii).\n(3) Intercompany gain from the Year A Liquidation with respect to the stock of Target \nSub 3 and Target Sub 5 (and any asset with respect to which the stock of those \nPLR-148291-12\n6\nsubsidiaries are successors under \u00a7 1.1502-13(j)(1)) will not be eliminated nor \ntaken into account as a result of the Proposed Transactions.\nCAVEATS\nNo opinion is requested and no opinion is expressed whether Proposed \nTransactions 1 and 2 will qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section \n368(a)(1)(F), or whether each of Proposed Transactions 3 through 9 will qualify as a \nliquidation under Sections 332 and 337 or as a reorganization under Section 368(a)(1).  \nAdditionally, no opinion is expressed concerning the tax treatment of the Proposed \nTransactions under other provisions of the Code or regulations or the tax treatment of \nany conditions existing at the time of, or effects resulting from, the Proposed \nTransactions that are not specifically covered by the above rulings.\nPROCEDURAL STATEMENTS\nThis ruling is directed only to the taxpayer requesting it.  Section 6110(k)(3) \nprovides that it may not be used or cited as precedent.  A copy of this letter must be \nattached to any income tax return to which it is relevant.  Alternatively, taxpayers filing \ntheir returns electronically may satisfy this requirement by attaching a statement to their \nreturn that provides the date and control number of this ruling letter.\nPursuant to the power of attorney on file in this office, a copy of this letter is being \nsent to your authorized representative.\nSincerely,\n_Lawrence M.

Claimant is an individual residing in State M.  Claimant uses the cash receipts\nand disbursement method of accounting for filing his federal income tax returns.  In May\n1995, Claimant negotiated a Settlement Agreement with a defendant to recover\ndamages on account of personal injuries that provides for periodic payments of $v per\nmonth beginning on date 1 for the longer of a u-year period (the Guaranteed Period) or\n2\nPLR-119273-97\n1  Assignee has advised Claimant and Factor that it will not honor the assignment of the periodic\npayments to Factor absent a court order.  Thus,  Assignee has not made any periodic payments to\nClaimant or Factor after it made the date 2 payment and the three succeeding monthly payments.\nClaimant\u2019s life.  You represent that amounts payable under the Settlement Agreement\nare excludable from Claimant\u2019s gross income under \u00a7 104(a)(2).  Pursuant to the\nSettlement Agreement, the defendant made an assignment of its periodic payment\nliability to Assignee in what you represent was a \u201cqualified assignment\u201d under \u00a7 130(c).\nThe Settlement Agreement states that Claimant has no right \u201caccelerate or defer said\nfuture payments, ... receive the present discounted value of future payments or ... have\nthe power to sell, mortgage, encumber, or anticipate the future payments or any part\nthereof by assignment or otherwise.\u201d\nAfter receiving monthly periodic payments of $v from Assignee for about 18 months, \nClaimant entered into a contract with Factor to transfer $w per month of his rights in the\nremaining monthly payments during the Guaranteed Period beginning on date 2 to\nFactor for a lump sum payment of $x.  This $w per month is equal to approximately\n80% of the $v monthly payments.  This transfer (\u201cFactoring Transaction\u201d) closed during\ndate 3 with Factor issuing checks to Claimant for $y, because Claimant, not Factor,\nreceived the date 2 payment and the three succeeding monthly payments.  \nAs part of the Factoring Transaction, Factor notified Assignee that it was to make the $v\nmonthly payments to Claimant at a new address in care of banks appointed by Factor\nto receive those payments.  Claimant also executed a power of attorney authorizing \nFactor or its assignee to cash the monthly periodic payment checks issued by\nAssignee.  Thus, after the Factoring Transaction, Factor was to receive the $v monthly\npayments from Assignee, retain from each full monthly payment the $w per month it\nacquired in exchange for its lump sum $y payment and then send a check to Claimant\nin the amount of the $z portion of each monthly payment that Claimant did not transfer\nto Factor.1   \nThe $y lump sum that Claimant received is equal to approximately 26 percent of the\nface amount of the payments acquired by Factor, resulting in a return to Factor of about\n20 percent.  You represent that Factor has engaged in other factoring transactions and\nthat each of them is individually structured and highly negotiated, both as to the\namounts being assigned at each payment interval and the discount rate applied thereto. \nYou represent that the Factoring Transaction is governed by and is enforceable under\nthe law of State N, and that a court in State M would look to State N law in determining\nwhether the Factoring Transaction is enforceable.  For purposes of this ruling we have\nassumed but do not decide that the Factoring Transaction is enforceable under\napplicable state laws.\n3\nPLR-119273-97\nSpecifically, you request the following two rulings:\n1.  Lump sum payments paid by Factor to Claimant in exchange for the right to\nreceive a portion of the future payments due to Claimant under the Settlement\nAgreement constitute damages received on account of personal injuries under\nformer \u00a7 104(a)(2).\n2.   Periodic payments paid to Claimant under the Settlement Agreement in\nexcess of the amount assigned by Claimant to Factor will constitute damages\nreceived on account of personal injuries under former \u00a7 104(a)(2).\nLAW.  Section 61(a) provides that except as otherwise provided in subtitle A,  gross\nincome means all income from whatever source derived.   \nSection 104(a)(2), as in effect prior to the amendments made by \u00a7 1605(a) of the Small\nBusiness Job Protection Act of 1996 (\u201c1996 Act\u201d), provided, in general that gross\nincome does not include the amount of any damages received (whether by suit or\nagreement and whether as lump sums or as periodic payments) on account of personal\ninjuries or sickness.  Section 1605(d)(2) of the Act provides that the amendments made\nby \u00a7 1605(a) to \u00a7 104(a)(2) do not apply to any amount received under a written binding\nagreement, court decree, or mediation award in effect on (or issued on or before)\nSeptember 13, 1995.    \nSection 451 provides that the amount of any item of gross income shall be included in\nthe gross income of the taxpayer for the taxable year in which received by the taxpayer,\nunless, under the method of accounting used in computing taxable income, the amount\nis to be accounted for as of a different period.  Section 1.451-1(a) of the Income Tax\nRegulations likewise provides that under the cash receipts and disbursements method\nof accounting, income must be included in gross income when actually or constructively\nreceived.    \nRev. Rul. 79-220, 1972-2 C.B. 74, involves an insurance company that had a continuing\nobligation to pay an amount monthly to an individual for an agreed period of time in\nsettlement of a suit for personal injuries.  The insurance company purchased a single\npremium annuity from another insurance company as an investment to provide a\nsource of funds to satisfy its obligation to the individual.  The ruling holds that the\nexclusion from gross income provided by \u00a7 104(a)(2) applies to the full amount of the\nmonthly payments received by the individual because the individual had a right to\nreceive only the monthly payments and did not have the actual or constructive receipt\nor the economic benefit of the lump sum amount that was invested to yield the monthly\npayments.  In support of its holding, Rev. Rul. 79-220 cites to Rev. Rul. 72-25, 1972-1\nC.B. 127, which relates to a similar arrangement made by an employer to provide for\npayment of deferred compensation to an employee and concludes that the employee\n4\nPLR-119273-97\nincludes the compensation in income in the taxable year in which it is actually received\nor otherwise made available, whichever is earlier.  \nAmounts that are not taxable under actual or constructive receipt principles,\nnevertheless, may satisfy the requirements for inclusion in income under the doctrine of\ncash equivalency.  Under this doctrine a taxpayer is treated as having income when the\ntaxpayer receives property that is the \u201cequivalent of cash.\u201d  Decisions in cases involving\ncash equivalency have been based on the facts and circumstances of particular cases.  \nIn situations where a contract provided for deferred payments and no notes or other\nevidences of indebtedness were given, the contract rights, which in the situations\ndescribed were not of a type commonly sold or given as part of a purchase price, were\nheld not to be property and, therefore, not a cash equivalent.  Ennis v. Commissioner,\n17 T.C. 465 (1951);  Johnson v. Commissioner, 14 T.C. 560 (1950).  Compare Rev.\nRul. 68-606, 1968-2 C.B. 42 (obligor\u2019s payments to make future installment payments is\na cash equivalent, even though contained only in a contract if the rights under the\ncontract are freely transferable and readily saleable.) \nUnder \u00a7 1.83-7(a) if a nonqualified stock option provided to an employee for services \nhas no readily ascertainable fair market value when granted, the employee defers\nincome realization until the option is exercised or the option is sold or otherwise\ndisposed of at which time the employee realizes compensation income.  See also Rev.\nRul. 72-25, supra. \nDISCUSSION.  Claimant settled his personal injury claim in exchange for defendant\u2019s\nobligation to make periodic payments, which was then assumed by Assignee.  Claimant\nhas not actually or constructively received the full damage amount.  In addition,\nClaimant did not receive the discounted value of Assignee\u2019s future periodic payment\nobligation because under these facts that payment obligation was in no proper sense\nthe equivalent of cash. Thus, Claimant excluded from gross income the full amount of\neach monthly payment as Assignee made each payment.  \nAs a result of the Factoring Transaction, Claimant received a $y lump sum payment in\nexchange for the sale of his right to receive $w of each of the remaining monthly\nperiodic payments for the Guaranteed Period, thereby closing the transaction as to that\nportion of Assignee\u2019s periodic payment obligation.  In the context of deferred\ncompensation, an employee\u2019s sale of a nonqualified stock option without a readily\nascertainable fair market value to a third party closes a transaction created when the\nemployer granted the option to the employee and results in income of the same\ncharacter (i.e., compensation income) to the employee in the year of the sale.  Similarly,\nClaimant\u2019s receipt of Factor\u2019s lump sum payment in exchange for the sale of his right to\n$w of each of the remaining monthly periodic payments closes the May 1995\ntransaction attributable to that portion of Assignee\u2019s periodic payment obligation and\nresults in income of the same character as would have been received absent the \n5\nPLR-119273-97\nFactoring Transaction.  Thus, the $y that Factor paid to Claimant in the Factoring\nTransaction is considered received on account of personal injuries under former \n\u00a7 104(a)(2).  The fact that the $y lump sum was paid by Factor does not affect its\ncharacter under \u00a7 104(a)(2) in this case in which the Settlement Agreement was not\nreadily saleable and Claimant uses the cash method of accounting.  See Rev. Rul. 72-\n224, 1972-1 C.B. 30 (cash method seller excludes from income as tax-exempt interest\nunder \u00a7 103 that portion of proceeds received from purchaser of state or local\ngovernmental obligation attributable to interest accrued prior to sale).  See also Rev.\nRul. 70-151, 1970-1 C.B. 116.  \nIn addition, Claimant did not transfer to Factor its right to receive $z per month out of\neach monthly payment during the Guaranteed Period.  However, pursuant to the\nFactoring Transaction, this $z of the monthly $v payment will be sent to Claimant in\ncare of a designated bank.  Factor will retain $w of the monthly payment and will direct\nthat the remaining $z be remitted to Claimant.  Thus, Factor is merely Claimant\u2019s agent\nwith respect to the $z per month of the periodic payments that are paid by Assignee\nunder the Settlement Agreement.     \nCONCLUSION.  Accordingly, based strictly on the information submitted and\nrepresentations and assumptions made, we conclude that:\n1.  The $y lump sum payment received by Claimant from Factor pursuant to the\nFactoring Transaction is damages received on account of personal injuries or\nsickness under former \u00a7 104(a)(2).\n2.  The $z monthly periodic payments paid by Assignee and remitted to Claimant\nby Factor, which were not assigned by Claimant to Factor in the Factoring\nTransaction are damages received on account of personal injuries or sickness\nunder former \u00a7 104(a)(2).  Similarly, periodic payments made after the\nGuaranteed Period, which were not assigned by Claimant to Factor in the\nFactoring Transaction and that are received by Claimant from Assignee are\ndamages received on account of personal injuries or sickness under former        \n\u00a7 104(a)(2).  \nExcept as expressly set forth in the preceding paragraph, no opinions are expressed\nconcerning the tax consequences of the transaction described in this letter under any\nprovision of the Internal Revenue Code.  As noted above we have assumed but not\ndecided that the Factoring Transaction is valid under applicable state law.  Thus, this\nruling shall be considered of no effect retroactively if the Factoring Transaction is not\nvalid under applicable state law.\nFor two reasons we decline to rule on Claimant\u2019s request concerning whether the\nFactoring Transaction adversely affected Assignee\u2019s exclusion under \u00a7 130 of amounts\nit received from defendant to assume the liability to make periodic payments.  First,\n6\nPLR-119273-97\nunder \u00a7 2.02 of Rev. Proc. 99-1 1999-1 I.R.B. 6, 12 the Service issues rulings applying\nthe tax laws to a taxpayer\u2019s specific set of facts.  The tax consequences under \u00a7 130 do\nno pertain to Claimant, the taxpayer who is requesting this ruling.  Second, the Service\nmay decline to issue a ruling when appropriate in the interest of sound tax\nadministration or on other grounds whenever warranted by the facts and circumstances\nof a particular case. \nA copy of this letter should be attached to any income tax return to which it is relevant.\nThis ruling is directed only to the taxpayer requesting it.  Section 6110(k)(3) provides\nthat it may not be used or cited as precedent.  \nSincerely,\nDeputy Assistant Chief Counsel\n(Income Tax & Accounting)\nBy                                                         \nMichael J.

The information in that\nrequest is summarized below.\nSummary of Facts   \n          Mutual Bank is a federally chartered mutual savings association engaged in\nbanking and banking related business in State X.  As a mutual entity, Mutual Bank does\nnot have authorized capital stock.  Instead, holders of Mutual Bank deposit accounts\n(the \u201cDepositors\u201d) have mutual ownership interests consisting of liquidation and voting\nrights in Mutual Bank.  \n          For what are represented to be valid business purposes, Mutual Bank\u2019s Board of\nDirectors has decided Mutual Bank should convert to a federally chartered mutual\nholding company structure.    \n                                                    \nProposed Transaction\nPLR-103743-99\n2\n          Mutual Bank proposes the following steps, all of which will be undertaken\npursuant to a plan and occur sequentially on approximately the same date:\n          (i) Mutual Bank will form a federal stock savings association (\u201cInterim 1\") as its\nwholly owned subsidiary.\n          (ii) Interim 1 will form a federal stock corporation (\u201cSHC\u201d) and an interim federal\nstock savings association (\u201cInterim 2\u201d), each as its wholly owned subsidiary.\n          (iii) Mutual Bank will exchange its federal mutual savings association charter for\nthat of a federal stock savings association to become Stock Bank (the \u201cConversion\u201d).  In\nthe Conversion, the Depositors will constructively exchange their mutual ownership\ninterests in Mutual bank for shares of stock in Stock Bank.\n(iv) Interim 1 will cancel its outstanding stock and exchange its charter for that of\na federal mutual holding company to become MHC.\n(v) Interim 2 will merge with and into Stock Bank with Stock Bank surviving as a\nwholly owned subsidiary of MHC (the \u201cMerger\u201d).  In the Merger, the Depositors will\nexchange the stock of Stock Bank constructively received in the Conversion for mutual\nownership interests in MHC.\n(vi) MHC will transfer the stock of Stock Bank to SHC (the \u201cContribution\u201d).\n(vii) SHC will offer for sale up to y percent of its common stock, with priority\nsubscription rights granted, in descending order, to certain Depositors in the former\nMutual Bank, to certain employee stock benefit plans of Stock Bank, to other members\nof Mutual Bank, and to certain members of the general public (the \u201cOffering\u201d).\n \n          As a result of the transaction, Stock Bank will be a wholly owned subsidiary of\nSHC, which will be (until step (vii) above) a wholly owned subsidiary of MHC.  MHC will\nnot have authorized capital stock.  Rather, mutual ownership interests in MHC will\nconsist solely of liquidation and voting rights.  The Depositors will retain interests in\nMHC as long as they maintain their deposit accounts in Stock Bank.\n          You propose that the transaction be treated as, in substance, the conversion of\nMutual Bank to Stock Bank, followed by the contribution of Stock Bank by its owners to\nMHC in exchange for mutual ownership interests in MHC, followed by the contribution\nof Stock Bank to SHC.  You further propose that the Conversion be treated as a\nreorganization described in \u00a7 368(a)(1)(F) of the Internal Revenue Code and that the\nMerger and Contribution be treated as transfers of property solely in exchange for stock\ndescribed in \u00a7 351(a).  \n          Section 3.01(27) of Rev. Proc. 99-3, 1999-1 I.R.B. 103, 107, provides that the\nPLR-103743-99\n3\nInternal Revenue Service will not rule on the qualification of a transaction as a\nreorganization under \u00a7 368(a)(1)(F).  Additionally, \u00a7 3.01(22) of Rev. Proc. 99-3\nprovides that the Service will not rule on the application of \u00a7 351 to an exchange of\nstock for stock in the formation of a holding company.  Although Rev. Proc. 99-3\nprovides a general no-rule policy concerning \u00a7\u00a7 368(a)(1)(F) and 351, it also provides\nthat the Service has discretion to rule on significant subissues that must be resolved to\ndetermine whether a transaction qualifies under either of those sections.  The Service\nwill only rule on such subissues if they are significant and not clearly and adequately\naddressed by a statute, regulation, decision of the Supreme Court, tax treaty, revenue\nruling, revenue procedure, notice, or other authority published in the Internal Revenue\nBulletin.\nRepresentation\n          To the best of the taxpayer\u2019s knowledge and belief, and but for the resolution of\nthe requested rulings below: (i) the Conversion is a reorganization described in\n\u00a7 368(a)(1)(F); and (ii) the Merger, in which the Exchange occurs, and the Contribution\nare transfers of property solely in exchange for stock described in \u00a7 351(a).\n          \nRulings\n          Based solely on the information submitted and the representation set forth\nabove, we rule as follows:\n          (1) The requirement \u00a7 1.368-1(b) and (e) of the Income Tax Regulations that\nthere be a continuity of interest in a reorganization is satisfied by the Depositors\u2019\nconstructive exchange of mutual ownership interests in Mutual Bank for stock in Stock\nBank in the Conversion, notwithstanding the Depositors\u2019 constructive exchange of that\nstock for mutual ownership interests in MHC immediately thereafter.  See Rev. Rul. 80-\n105, 1980-1 C.B. 78; Rev. Rul. 69-646, 1969-2 C.B. 54.\n          (2) Neither the Exchange, the Contribution, nor the Offering will prevent the\nConversion from qualifying as a reorganization under \u00a7 368(a)(1)(F).  See \u00a7 1.368-\n1(e)(2); Rev. Rul. 96-29, 1996-1 C.B. 50; Rev. Rul. 80-105, 1980-1 C.B. 78; Rev. Rul.\n69-516, 1969-2 C.B. 56.\n          (3) The Merger, in which the Exchange occurs, will be treated as the Depositors\u2019\ncontribution of Stock Bank to MHC in exchange for mutual ownership interests in MHC. \nSee Rev. Rul. 90-95, 1990-2 C.B. 67; Rev. Rul. 67-448, 1967-2 C.B. 144.\n          (4) The mutual ownership interests in MHC received by the Depositors will be\ntreated as stock within the meaning of \u00a7 351(a).  See Rev. Rul. 78-286, 1978-2 C.B.\n145; Rev. Rul. 69-3, 1969-1 C.B. 103.\nPLR-103743-99\n4\n   \n          A determination of whether the Conversion qualifies as a reorganization under\n\u00a7 368(a)(1)(F) and whether the Exchange and Contribution are described in \u00a7 351(a)\nwill be made by the District Director\u2019s office upon audit of the federal income tax returns\nof Mutual Bank, Stock Bank, SHC, and MHC.\n          We express no opinion on the tax treatment of the transaction under other\nprovisions of the Code and regulations, or the tax treatment of any conditions existing at\nthe time of, or effects resulting from, the transaction that are not specifically covered by\nthe above rulings.\nThe rulings in this letter are based on the facts and representations submitted\nunder penalties of perjury in support of the request for rulings.

Sister Corp., an affiliate of\nTaxpayer, administers the ABC Program.  You have requested a ruling that,  for purposes of\ndetermining whether the investments supporting the AB Contracts whose owners are enrolled in\nthe ABC Program are adequately diversified for purposes of \u00a7 817(h) of the Internal Revenue\nCode, the group of assets selected by Sister Corp. for each \u201cinvestment profile\u201d within the ABC\nProgram qualifies as the \u201csegregated asset account\u201d (as defined in \u00a7 1.817-5(e) of the Income \nTax Regulations) for the AB Contracts assigned to that \u201cinvestment profile.\u201d   Additional\ninformation and representations relating to this ruling request were submitted by letters dated\nAugust 16, 2000, October 12, 2000, and January 22, 2001.  \nFACTS\nInsurer 1 and Insurer 2 are wholly owned stock subsidiaries of Second Tier Parent, which\nis a wholly owned stock subsidiary of First Tier Parent, and are life insurance companies subject\n-3-\n1\n2\nIn the case of Insurer 1, Separate Account 1 and Separate Account 2 are separate\ninvestment accounts established on Date A, under the laws of State A.  In the case of Insurer 2,\nSeparate Account 1 and Separate Account 2 are separate investment accounts established on Date\nB, under the laws of State B.  Each Separate Account 2 holds shares in a                    fund and is\nnot relevant for purposes of this ruling.\nto tax under \u00a7 801 of the Code.  Both Sister Corp. and First Tier Parent are wholly owned stock\nsubsidiaries of Parent; Broker Affiliate is a wholly owned stock subsidiary of Sister Corp. \nInsurer 1 is organized under the laws of State A and Insurer 2 is organized under the laws of\nState B.  Each of the foregoing corporations join with Parent, as the common parent of the\naffiliated group, in the filing of a consolidated federal income tax return.  Because the underlying\nfacts relevant to this ruling request are identical for both Insurer 1 and Insurer 2,  the term\n\u201cTaxpayer\u201d will be used hereinafter to apply to both life insurance companies.  \nIn Date C, Taxpayer began offering the AB Contracts.                                                          \n                                                                                                                                                             \n                                                                                                                                                     1      \n        At present, Taxpayer has approximately b AB Contracts outstanding.  \nThe AB Contracts provide for an initial premium payment and generally permit the policy\nowner to make additional premiums at any time prior to the annuity date.  Although Taxpayer\nowns the assets supporting the AB Contracts, State law requires these assets be segregated from\nTaxpayer\u2019s other assets.   Taxpayer holds the assets supporting the AB Contracts in Separate\nAccount 1 or Separate Account 2.   Assets held in these separate accounts cannot be charged with\nliabilities arising out of any other business that Taxpayer conducts.  Additionally, a Separate\nAccount cannot be charged with any liabilities of any other Separate Account of Taxpayer.2  The\nSeparate Accounts are each registered as a unit investment trust under the Investment Company\nAct of 1940 (the \u201c1940 Act\u201d).  Taxpayer has organized Separate Account 1 into various divisions\nthat it refers to as \u201csubaccounts.\u201d\nIf not enrolled in the ABC Program, the owner of an AB Contract may direct the\ninvestment of his or her premiums among a number of investment options, each of which is \nrepresented by a subaccount of Separate Account 1.  Each subaccount is represented by shares of\na regulated investment company (hereinafter referred to collectively as the \u201cFunds\u201d).  The policy\nowner is permitted to reallocate contract values among the Funds supporting the AB Contract\nwhenever he or she chooses, but Fund transfers in excess of   per year are subject to a transfer\nchange and Taxpayer reserves the right to limit the number of additional transfers permitted.   \nEach Fund is registered (or is a \u201cseries\u201d of a mutual fund that is registered) under the\n1940 Act as an open-end management investment company.  Each of the Funds has a stated\ninvestment objective and professional fund manager or managers who make all decisions\n-4-\n3\nIn order to assist Sister Corp. in implementing its investment strategies, Taxpayer\nhas modified a number of the provisions of the AB Contracts as regards those owners who\nparticipate in the ABC Program.  For example, owners of AB Contracts who are enrolled in the\nABC Program may not choose Dollar Cost Averaging, they are not subject to subaccount transfer\nfees, and they not subject to any limit that may be imposed on the maximum number of Fund\ntransfers per year.  \nregarding how the Fund\u2019s assets will be invested.  Each Fund is treated as a separate regulated\ninvestment company under \u00a7 851 and meets the diversification requirements of \u00a7 1.851-2(c) of\nthe Income Tax Regulations.  Additionally, each Fund is required by its investment policies to\nmanage its investment assets in a manner that will assure that those assets will always be\nadequately diversified within the meaning of \u00a7 817(h) and \u00a7 1.817-5(b).  Shares in the Funds are\noffered solely to pension plans and to life insurance company separate accounts to support\nvariable annuity and life insurance contracts. \nShares in the Funds fluctuate in value based on the investment experience of the\nunderlying regulated investment company.  The amount paid as an annuity under the AB\nContract reflects the investment return and market value of the assets represented by the shares of\nthe Funds to which the policy owner has allocated the premiums and contract values. \nSince Date C, Taxpayer has offered an asset allocation program (the \u201cABC Program\u201d) to\nowners of AB Contracts who are interested in obtaining the expertise of the investment\nprofessionals employed by Sister Corp. in managing the portfolio of assets supporting their AB\nContracts.  Generally, the owner of an AB Contract will enroll in the ABC Program at the same\ntime he or she purchases the AB Contract.                                                                                         \n                                                                                                                                                     \nTo enroll in the ABC Program, the owner of an AB Contract executes an agreement\nwhich provides that any allocation of the premiums and contract values among the subaccounts\nof Separate Account 1 shall be at the direction of Sister Corp. so long as the contract owner\ncontinues to be enrolled in the ABC Program.  The fundamental premise of the ABC Program is\nthat, in exchange for obtaining the investment expertise of Sister Corp.\u2019s investment\nprofessionals, the policy owner  gives up the right to select the Funds that support his or her\ncontract.  Rather, the Funds are selected by investment professionals of Sister Corp.3  The policy\nowner pays Sister Corp. an annual advisory fee for the services provided by Sister Corp. in\nmanaging the portfolio of investments underlying his or her AB Contract.  At present,\napproximately c of Taxpayer\u2019 AB contract owners have elected to participate in the ABC\nProgram. \nPrior to enrolling in the ABC Program, the policy owner must complete an ABC Profiling\nQuestionnaire, which elicits information about the extent and nature of the policy owner\u2019s\nfinancial holdings, tolerance for risk, and time horizon.  The questionnaire is initially evaluated\nby Taxpayer for a preliminary determination of the policy owner\u2019s eligibility for the ABC\nProgram and to ensure proper completion of all documentation.   Next, the completed\n-5-\nquestionnaire is  evaluated by personnel of Sister Corp. in accordance with an algorithm which\ndetermines whether the policy owner is suitable for one of the \u201cinvestment profiles\u201d designed by\nSister Corp. for the ABC Program.   \nWhile a contract owner\u2019s responses to the questionnaire may affect the application of the\nalgorithm and the investment profile assigned to the contract owner by Sister Corp.\u2019s investment\nprofessionals, the contract owner cannot select specific subaccounts or specific securities for\ninvestment.  Each investment profile consists of a particular selection of Funds and a plan of\nallocation among those Funds that are appropriate for contract owners fitting that profile.  At any\ngiven time, several thousand contract owners may be assigned to a particular investment profile.\nIf a contract owner requests that a particular Fund or Funds be included in the portfolio of Funds\nthat support his or her contract, this request will be denied.  Sister Corp., in its sole discretion,\ndetermines the group of Funds that are associated with each investment profile and the\nproportion of premiums and contract values allocated to each Fund.  The group of Funds selected\nfor an investment profile and the allocation of premiums and contract values among the Funds in\nthat group may be changed by the personnel of Sister Corp. at any time.  A policy owner is not\nadvised of the existence of the investment profiles or of the composition of the Funds for each\ninvestment profile prior to the investment of any premium or contract value by Sister Corp.\u2019s\ninvestment professionals.  However, quarterly statements and investment confirmation\nstatements inform a contract owner after Fund shares have been purchased by the subaccounts to\nwhich premiums and contract values have been allocated on behalf of the policy owner.     \nThe ABC Profiling Questionnaire does advise the policy owner that he or she \u201cmay have\nthe ability to restrict certain funds\u201d from the portfolio of investments that support his or her AB\nContract.  In actual practice, however, very few of the participants in the ABC Program have\nrequested that a specific fund be restricted from the portfolio of investments supporting their AB\nContracts.  Moreover, a restriction request is evaluated to determine whether the restriction\nrequest may be accommodated without compromising Sister Corp.\u2019s responsibility for\ndetermining how the premiums and contract values are invested.  Requests for specific\ninvestment allocations are not honored.  If the contract owner requests that multiple Funds be\nexcluded from the portfolio supporting his or her AB Contract, or if the requested restriction\nwould prevent Sister Corp.\u2019s investment professionals from making sound investment decisions\non the policyholder\u2019s behalf, this contract owner would be reminded that the ABC Program is\nintended for the contract owner who wants Sister Corp.\u2019s investment professionals to make all\ninvestment decisions regarding the allocations of premiums and contract values.  The contract\nowner would be offered the opportunity to modify or withdraw the restriction request and enroll\n(or remain) in the ABC Program.  Contract owners who decide to take control over the\ninvestment of premiums and/contract values in specific Funds will terminate their participation\nin the ABC Program.\nThe operative effect of the ABC Program, therefore, is that the premiums and contrct\nvalues of every AB Contract assigned to a particular investment profile are allocated to each of\n-6-\nthe Funds in that profile in the same fashion.  Every policy owner assigned to a particular\ninvestment profile will have the same relative portion of his or her total contract value allocated \nto a Fund as every other policy owner assigned to that investment profile.  Each AB Contract\nassigned to a particular investment profile, therefore, will share in the market value and\ninvestment return of the particular mix of assets allocated to that investment profile in an\nidentical manner with every AB Contract assigned to that investment profile.\nBased on the foregoing, Taxpayer has requested a ruling that, in determining whether the\ninvestments supporting the AB Contracts issued by Taxpayer to policyholders who enroll in the\nABC Program are \u201cadequately diversified\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 817(h), Taxpayer should\nconsider the assets of all of the Funds assigned to a particular investment profile as comprising\nthe \u201csegregated asset account\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 1.817-5(e) for AB contracts assigned to\nthat investment profile. \nLAW AND ANALYSIS\nSection 817(d) defines the term \u201cvariable contract\u201d for purposes of Part I of subchapter L\nof the Code (\u00a7\u00a7 801-818).  In order for an annuity contract to be a variable contract, (1) it must\nprovide for the allocation of all or part of the amounts received under the contract to an account\nthat, pursuant to state law or regulation, is segregated from the general asset accounts of the\nissuing insurance company; (2) it must provide for the payment of annuities; and (3) \u201cthe\namounts paid in, or the amounts paid out, must reflect the investment return and market value of\nthe segregated asset account.\u201d  Section 817(d)(1)-(3).\nSection 817(h)(1) provides that, for purposes of subchapter L, \u00a7 72 (relating to annuities),\nand \u00a7 7702(a) (relating to the definition of a life insurance contract), a variable contract (other\nthan a pension plan contract), which is otherwise described in \u00a7 817 and which is based on a\nsegregated asset account, shall not be treated as an annuity, endowment, or life insurance contract\nfor any period (and any subsequent period) for which the investments made by such account are\nnot, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Treasury, adequately diversified.\nSection 1.817-5 contains the diversification requirements for variable contracts based on\nsegregated asset accounts.  Generally, the investments of a segregated asset account will be\nconsidered to be \u201cadequately diversified\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 817(h) and \u00a7 1.817-5 if no more than\n55 percent of the value of the total assets of the account is represented by any one investment, no\nmore than 70 percent by any two investments, no more than 80 percent by any three investments,\nand no more than 90 per cent by any four investments.  See \u00a7 1.817-5(b)(1).\nSection 817(h)(4) provides, in certain situations,  a \u201clook-through\u201d rule for meeting the\ndiversification requirements.  If all of the beneficial interests in a regulated investment company\nor trust are held by one or more (A) insurance companies (or affiliated companies) in their\ngeneral account or in segregated asset accounts, or (B) fund manages (or affiliated companies) in\nconnection with the creation or management of the regulated investment company, the\n-7-\ndiversification requirements of \u00a7 817(h) are applied by taking into account the assets held by\nsuch regulated investment company.\nSection 1.817-5(f)(1) provides that, if the \u201clook-through\u201d rule applies, a beneficial\ninterest in an investment company, partnership, or trust will not be treated as a single investment\nof the segregated asset account.  Instead, a pro rata portion of each asset of the investment\ncompany, partnership, or trust is treated, for purposes of \u00a7 1.817-5, as an asset of the segregated\nasset account.\nSection 1.817-5(f)(2)(i) provides, in relevant part, that the \u201clook-through\u201d rule will apply\nto an investment company only if- (i) all the beneficial interests in the investment company (other\nthan those described in \u00a7 1.817-5(f)(3)) are held by one or more segregated asset accounts of one\nor more insurance companies; and (ii) public access to such investment company is available\nexclusively (except as otherwise permitted in \u00a7 1.817-5(f)(3)) through the purchase of a variable\ncontract.\nSection 1.817-5(e) provides that, for purposes of \u00a7 817(h) and the diversification\nrequirements of \u00a7 1.817-5, a \u201csegregated asset account shall consist of all assets the investment\nreturn and market value of each must be allocated in an identical manner to any variable contract\ninvested in any such assets.\u201d\nSection 1.817-5(g) contains examples that illustrate the provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 1.817-5(e) and\n(f).  In Example 1, a life insurance company\u2019s variable contracts are supported by two groups of\nassets: (a) a diversified portfolio of debt securities, and (b) interests in P, a partnership that is\npublicly registered.  All of the beneficial interests in P are held by one or more segregated asset\naccounts of one or more insurance companies and public access to P is available through the\npurchase of a variable contract.  The variable contracts provide that policyholders may specify\nwhich portion of each premium is to be invested in the debt securities and which portion is to be\ninvested in P interests.  The portfolio of debt securities and the assets of P, considered separately,\neach satisfy the diversification requirements of \u00a7 1.817-5(b).\nAccording to Example 1, as a result of the ability of policyholders to allocate premiums\namong the two groups of assets, the investment return and market value of the interests in P and\nthe debt securities may be allocated to different variable contracts in a non-identical manner. \nAccordingly, the interests in P are treated as part of one segregated asset account \n(\u201cAccount 1\") and the debt securities are treated as part of a different segregated asset account\n(\u201cAccount 2\").  Because P is a partnership described in \u00a7 1.817-5(f)(2)(i), interests in P will not\nbe treated as a single investment of Account 1.  Rather, Account 1 is treated as owning a pro rata\nportion of the assets of P.  Because Account 1 and Account 2 each satisfy the requirements of\n\u00a7 1.817-5(b), variable contracts that are based on either or both accounts will be treated as\nannuity, endowment, or life insurance contracts.\n-8-\nThe facts in Example 2 are the same as in Example 1, except some of the interests in P\nare held by persons not described in \u00a7 1.817-5(f)(3).  As a result, the \u201clook-through\u201d rule does\nnot apply, and interests in P will be treated as a single investment of Account 1.  Thus, Account 1\ndoes not satisfy the diversification requirements of \u00a7 1.817-5(b), and variable contracts based on\nwhole or in part on Account 1 will not be treated as annuity, endowment, or life insurance\ncontracts.\nThe facts in Example 4 are the same as in Example 2, except that the variable contracts\ndo not permit policyholders to allocate premiums between or among the portfolio of debit\nsecurities and interests in P.  As a result, the investment return and market value of the interests\nin P and the debt securities must be allocated to the same variable contracts and in an identical\nmanner.  Thus, under \u00a7 1.817-5(e), the interests in P and the debt securities are treated as part of\na single segregated asset account.  If the interests in P (which by itself does not meet the\ndiversification requirements of \u00a7 1.817-5(b)) and the debt securities, considered together, satisfy\nthe diversification requirements of \u00a71.817-5(b), contracts based on this segregated asset account\nwill be treated as annuity, endowment, or life insurance contracts.\nSection 1.817-5(e) defines a \u201csegregated asset account\u201d as consisting of \u201call assets the\ninvestment return and market value of each of which must be allocated in an identical manner to\nany variable contract invested in any of such assets.\u201d  This definition focuses on whether the\ninvestment return and market value of each asset in a group of assets must be allocated in\nidentical proportions to all policyholders whose contract values are supported by that group of\nassets.   The examples of \u00a7 1.817-5(g) illustrate this definition by combining assets into one\nsegregated asset account, or dividing assets into multiple segregated asset accounts, depending on\nwhether policyholders have the ability under their contracts to allocate their premiums within the\ngroup of assets.  In other words, if policyholders have the ability to allocate their premiums or\ncontract values between or among various assets, the assets cannot be treated as a single\nsegregated asset account.        \nTaxpayer represents that owners of AB Contracts who are enrolled in the ABC Program\nmay neither direct the allocation of their premiums or policy values among the various\nsubaccounts nor choose among the Funds available to support their contracts.  Rather, the\nparticular Funds that support the AB Contracts of policyholders who have enrolled in the ABC\nProgram are selected solely by investment professionals employed by Sister Corp.  As noted, the\ninvestment professionals employed by Sister Corp. combine Funds into \u201cinvestment profiles\u201d\nand assign owners of AB Contracts to various profiles depending upon their personal financial\ninformation and tolerance for risk.  At any given time, several thousand contract owners may be\nassigned to a particular investment profile.  If  the owner of an AB Contract who is enrolled in\nthe ABC Program requests the investment professionals employed by Sister Corp. to include a\nparticular Fund or Funds in the portfolio of Funds that supports his or her AB Contract, this\nrequest would be denied.   In addition, no owner of an AB Contract whose contract values are\nadministered under the ABC Program may request that particular types of securities (for\nexample, stocks of communications companies) be excluded from the investment portfolio\n-9-\nsupporting his or her AB Contract.  Accordingly, the operation of the ABC Program results in the\ninvestment return and market value of the assets from the Funds selected for an investment\nprofile being allocated in an identical manner to all AB Contracts assigned to that investment\nprofile.  The assets from the Funds selected for each investment profile, therefore, may be\nproperly characterized as the \u201csegregated asset account\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 1.817-5(e)\nwhich supports the AB Contracts assigned to that investment profile. \nAccordingly, based solely on the information submitted and the representations made in\nconnection with Taxpayer\u2019 ruling request, we conclude as follows:\nFor purposes of determining whether the investments supporting the AB Contracts whose\npolicy owners have enrolled in the ABC Program are \u201cadequately diversified\u201d within the\nmeaning of \u00a7 817(h) and \u00a7 1.817-5(b), the group of assets corresponding to the combination of\nFunds selected by Sister Corp.\u2019s investment professionals for each investment profile comprises\nthe \u201csegregated asset account\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 1.817-5(e) for the AB Contracts assigned\nto that particular investment profile. \n      \nExcept as expressly provided herein, no opinion is expressed or implied concerning the\ntax consequences of any aspect of any transaction or item discussed or referenced in this letter.   \nThis ruling is directed only to the taxpayer who requested it.

Additional information was submitted in letters dated November 30, 2001,\nFebruary 12, 13, and March 1, 2002.  The information submitted for consideration is\nsubstantially as set forth below.\nThe ruling contained in this letter is based upon information and representations\nsubmitted by the taxpayer and accompanied by a penalty of perjury statement executed\nby an appropriate party.  While this office has not verified any of the material submitted\nin support of the request for rulings, it is subject to verification on examination.\nA was born on Date B in Country C.  A came to the United States for\nemployment reasons and obtained a green card.  A is also a citizen of Country C where\nhe now lives.  On Date D, A relinquished his green card.  A will be subject to Country C\ntax on his worldwide income.  On the date of A\u2019s expatriation, his net worth exceeded\nthe applicable amount set forth in section 877(a)(2).\nSection 877 generally provides that a citizen who loses U.S. citizenship or a U.S.\nlong-term resident who ceases to be taxed as a lawful permanent resident (individuals\nwho \"expatriate\") within the 10-year period immediately preceding the close of the\ntaxable year will be subject to the special rules of section 877(d) for such taxable year,\nunless such loss did not have for one of its principal purposes the avoidance of U.S.\n2\nPLR-106358-02\ntaxes. Sections 2107 and 2501(a)(3) provide special estate and gift tax regimes,\nrespectively, for individuals who expatriate with a principal purpose to avoid U.S. taxes.\nA former U.S. citizen or former U.S. long-term resident will be treated as having\nexpatriated with a principal purpose to avoid U.S. taxes for purposes of sections 877,\n2107 and 2501(a)(3) if the individual\u2019s average income tax liability or the individual\u2019s net\nworth on the date of expatriation exceed certain thresholds. See sections 877(a)(2),\n2107(a)(2)(A) and 2501(a)(3)(B).\nA former U.S. citizen whose net worth or average tax liability exceeds these\nthresholds, however, will not be presumed to have a principal purpose of tax avoidance\nif that former citizen is described within certain statutory categories and submits a\nrequest for a ruling within one year of the date of loss of U.S. citizenship for the\nSecretary\u2019s determination as to whether such loss had for one of its principal purposes\nthe avoidance of U.S. taxes.

Therefore, A will not be presumed under section\n877(a)(2) to have had as one of his principal purposes for expatriating the avoidance of\nU.S. taxes.  We further conclude that A will not be treated under section 877(a)(2) as\nhaving had as one of his principal purposes for expatriating the avoidance of U.S. taxes\nbecause the information submitted clearly establishes the lack of a principal purpose to\navoid taxes under subtitle A or B of the Code.\nExcept as expressly provided herein, no opinion is expressed or implied\nconcerning the tax consequences of any aspect of any transaction or item discussed or\nreferenced in this letter.  In addition, no opinion is expressed as to A\u2019s U.S. tax liability\n3\nPLR-106358-02\nfor the taxable years prior to or after his expatriation under sections of the Code other\nthan sections 877, 2107, and 2501(a)(3).\nA copy of this letter must be attached to A\u2019s U.S. income tax return for the year in\nwhich A obtained the ruling (whether or not A is otherwise required to file a return).\nThis ruling is directed only to the taxpayer requesting it.

Fund requests \nthat the Internal Revenue Service rule that: (1) any and all cash and shares of Fund's \ncommon stock distributed by Fund as part of the Dividend (as described in this letter) \nshall be treated as a distribution of property with respect to its common stock to which \nsection 301 of Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \"Code\") applies and \n(2) the amount of the dividend of shares of Fund's common stock received by any \nshareholder electing to receive such shares will be considered to equal the amount of \nPLR-150872-08\n2\nmoney which could have been received instead had the shareholder elected cash \n(without regard to the cash limit) pursuant to section 1.305-1(b)(2) of the Income Tax \nRegulations (the \u201cRegulations\u201d).\nFACTS\nFund is organized as a State corporation and is registered under the Investment \nCompany Act of 1940, 15 U.S.C. 80a-1 et seq., as amended (the \u201c1940 Act\u201d), as a \nclosed-end management investment company.  Fund has elected to qualify as a \nregulated investment company (\u201cRIC\u201d) under section 851 of the Code. \nFund has one class of common stock outstanding (the \u201cCommon Stock\u201d), which \nis publicly traded and listed on the Exchange.\nAs a RIC, Fund regularly distributes its earnings and profits as required under \nsection 852(a)(1) of the Code.  In order to meet the requirements under section \n852(a)(1) and to avoid incurring an excise tax under section 4982, Fund intends to \ndeclare a dividend in the total amount of approximately $Z with respect to its taxable \nyear ended Date 1 (the \"Dividend\").  The Dividend will be declared on or before Date 2 \nto shareholders of record as of a day in Month 1, and paid on a day in Month 2 (the \n\u201cPayment Date\u201d).\nEach shareholder entitled to receive the Dividend will be permitted to designate \nby a specified date (the \"Shareholder Election Date\") whether it desires to receive its \ndistribution in the form of (a) cash (the \"Cash Option\") or (b) Common Stock (the \"Stock \nOption\").  If any shareholder does not make a valid election by the Shareholder Election \nDate, the shareholder will receive the Dividend entirely in Common Stock pursuant to \nthe Stock Option (the \"Default Election\").  Generally, Fund will pay cash in lieu of any \nfractional shares.  Fund will issue fractional shares to direct shareholders (those who \nown their shares directly with Fund and not through an intermediary) who participate in \nFund's dividend reinvestment plan.  All other Fund shareholders will receive cash in lieu \nof fractional shares. There are no provisions in Fund's charter that would limit share \nownership of Common Stock received as part of the Dividend.  \nFund expects that Common Stock issued as part of the Dividend will be of \nequivalent value to the amount of cash which would have been distributed instead had \nthe shareholder elected the Cash Option (without regard to the \"Cash Limit\u201d as defined \nbelow).  The number of shares of Common Stock to be issued as part of the Dividend will be \ncalculated in accordance with a formula that is based on the fair market value of Fund\u2019s shares \nof Common Stock as of a date (the \"Valuation Date\") that will be as close as reasonably \npracticable to the Payment Date.   The formula referred to in the preceding sentence will \nincorporate an adjustment that reflects the decrease in the stock's price which will result \nfrom a delayed ex-dividend date.\nPLR-150872-08\n3\nPursuant to the terms of the Dividend, the total amount of cash distributed, \nexcluding cash paid in lieu of fractional shares of Common Stock, will be limited to 20% \nof the total Dividend (such amount, the \"Cash Limit\").  Any remaining unpaid balance of \nthe Dividend in excess of cash equal to the Cash Limit will be paid in shares of \nCommon Stock.  \nIf the total number of shares of Common Stock electing for the Cash Option \n(\"Cash Election Shares\") would result in the payment of cash in an aggregate amount \nthat is less than or equal to the Cash Limit, then all holders of Cash Election Shares will \nreceive cash on all such shares.  If the number of Cash Election Shares would result in \nthe payment of cash in an aggregate amount that is greater than the Cash Limit, then \neach shareholder electing the Cash Option will receive the following on its Cash \nElection Shares:  (a) cash on each shareholder's Cash Election Shares equal to the \nproportion that such shareholder's Cash Election Shares bear to the total Cash Election \nShares of all shareholders, multiplied by an amount equal to the Cash Limit, plus (b) \nshares of Common Stock on each shareholder's remaining Cash Election Shares.  If the \nnumber of Cash Election Shares would result in the payment of cash in an aggregate \namount that is greater than the Cash Limit, a shareholder electing the Cash Option will \ninstead receive a pro rata amount of cash but in no case less than 20% of its share of \nthe Dividend in cash.\nLAW AND ANALYSIS\nSection 852(a)(1) of the Code provides, in part, that the provisions of part I of \nsubchapter M of Chapter 1 (except section 852(c)) shall not apply to a RIC for a tax \nyear unless the deduction for dividends paid during the taxable year (as defined in \nsection 561, but determined without regard to capital gains dividends) equals or \nexceeds 90 percent of its investment company taxable income.  \nSection 852(b)(2)(B) of the Code provides that in determining investment \ncompany taxable income, the taxable income of the RIC shall be adjusted by, among \nother things, the deduction for dividends paid during the year (as defined in section 561) \ncomputed without regard to capital gain dividends and exempt-interest dividends.  \nSection 561(a) of the Code provides, in part, that the deduction for dividends paid \nshall be the sum of (1) the dividends paid during the taxable year, and (2) the consent \ndividends for the taxable year (determined under section 565).  \nSection 562(a) of the Code provides that the term dividend shall, except as \notherwise provided in that section, include only dividends described in section 316. \nSection 301(a) of the Code generally provides that a distribution of property \nmade to a shareholder shall be treated in the manner provided in section 301(c). \nSection 301(c)(1) provides that in the case of a distribution to which section 301(a) \napplies, that portion of the distribution that is a dividend (as defined in section 316) shall \nPLR-150872-08\n4\nbe included in gross income. The term dividend is defined in section 316(a) as any \ndistribution of property made by a corporation to its shareholders out of current or \naccumulated earnings and profits. \nSection 305(a) of the Code provides that, except as otherwise provided in section \n305, gross income does not include the amount of any distribution of the stock of a \ncorporation made by such corporation to its shareholders with respect to its stock.\nSection 305(b)(1) provides that section 305(a) shall not apply to a distribution by \na corporation of its stock, and the distribution shall be treated as a distribution of \nproperty to which section 301 applies, if the distribution is, at the election of any of the \nshareholders (whether exercised before or after the declaration thereof), payable either \nin its stock or in property.\nSection 305(b)(2) provides that section 305(a) shall not apply to a distribution by \na corporation of its stock, and the distribution shall be treated as a distribution of \nproperty to which section 301 applies, if the distribution (or a series of distributions of \nwhich such distribution is one) has the result of the receipt of property by some \nshareholders, and an increase in the proportionate interests of other shareholders in the \nassets or earnings and profits of the corporation.\nSection 1.305-2 of the Regulations generally provides that under section \n305(b)(1), if any shareholder has the right to an election or option with respect to \nwhether a distribution shall be made either in money or any other property, or in stock or \nrights to acquire stock of the distributing corporation, then, with respect to all \nshareholders, the distribution of stock or rights to acquire stock is treated as a \ndistribution of property to which section 301 applies.\nCONCLUSION\nBased solely on the information provided and the representations made, we rule \nas follows:  Any and all of the cash and stock distributed in the Dividend by Fund shall \nbe treated as a distribution of property with respect to its stock to which section 301 \napplies.  We further rule that the amount of the distribution of the stock received by any \nshareholder electing to receive stock will be considered to equal the amount of the \nmoney that could have been received instead under section 1.305-1(b)(2) of the \nRegulations.  \nCAVEATS\nExcept as expressly provided herein, no opinion is expressed or implied \nconcerning the tax consequences of any aspect of any transaction or item discussed or \nreferenced in this letter.

Additional information with respect to the proposed transaction\nwas submitted in letters dated December 10, 1999 and January 12, 2000.  The\ninformation submitted for consideration is summarized below.  \nAcquiring is organized under the laws of State X and registered under the\nInvestment Company Act of 1940 (the \u201c1940 Act\u201d) as a non-diversified, closed-end\nmanagement investment company.  Acquiring has elected to be taxed as a regulated\ninvestment company (\u201cRIC\u201d) under \u00a7\u00a7 851-855 of the Internal Revenue Code (the\n\u201cCode\u201d).  Acquiring\u2019s investment objective is to provide shareholders with high income\nexempt from Federal income tax and State Y personal income taxes.  Acquiring seeks\nto achieve its investment objective by investing primarily in a portfolio of long-term,\ninvestment grade municipal obligations issued by or on behalf of State Y, its political\nsubdivisions, agencies and instrumentalities and by other qualifying issuers that pay\ninterest which, in the opinion of bond counsel to the issuer, is exempt from Federal\nincome tax and State Y personal income taxes.  Acquiring currently has outstanding\nvoting common stock and one series of voting preferred stock.\nTarget Fund is organized under the laws of State X and registered under the\nInvestment Company Act of 1940 (the \u201c1940 Act\u201d) as a non-diversified, closed-end\n2\nPLR-116161-99\nmanagement investment company.  Target Fund has elected to be taxed as a RIC\nunder \u00a7\u00a7 851-855 Code.  Like Acquiring, Target Fund's investment objective is to\nprovide shareholders with current income exempt from Federal income tax and State Y\npersonal income taxes.  Target Fund seeks to achieve its investment objective by\ninvesting primarily in a portfolio of long-term, investment grade municipal obligations\nissued by or on behalf of State Y, its political subdivisions, agencies and\ninstrumentalities and by other qualifying issuers that pay interest which, in the opinion of\nbond counsel to the issuer, is exempt from Federal income tax and State Y personal\nincome taxes.  Target Fund currently has outstanding voting common stock and one\nseries of voting preferred stock.\nAcquiring and Target Fund have entered into an agreement and plan of\nreorganization for what are represented to be valid business reasons.  Pursuant to the\nagreement, the transaction consists of the following steps:\n(1)\nTarget Fund will transfer all of its assets and liabilities to Acquiring in exchange\nfor an equal value of newly issued Acquired common voting stock and non-\nqualified preferred stock.\n(2)\nTarget Fund will distribute to their shareholders all of the Acquiring stock\nreceived in the transaction.  Each Target Fund shareholder will receive shares of\nAcquiring on a pro rata basis.\n(3)\nTarget Fund will liquidate and dissolve in accordance with the laws of State X,\nand terminate its registration under the 1940 Act.\nThe following representations have been made in connection with the proposed\ntransaction:\n(a)  The fair market value of the Acquiring stock received by Target Fund shareholders\nwill be approximately equal to the fair market value of the Target Fund stock\nsurrendered in the exchange.\n(c)  Acquiring will acquire at least 90 percent of the fair market value of the net assets\nand at least 70 percent of the fair market value of the gross assets held by Target Fund\nimmediately prior to the Reorganization.  For purposes of this representation, amounts\npaid by Target Fund to dissenters, amounts used by Target Fund to pay its\nreorganization expenses, amounts paid by Target Fund to shareholders who receive\ncash or other property, and all redemptions and distributions (except for redemptions in\nthe ordinary course of Target Fund\u2019s business as an closed-end investment company\nas required by \u00a7 22(e) of the 1940 Act pursuant to a demand of a shareholder and\nregular, normal dividends) made by Target Fund immediately preceding the transfer will\nbe included as assets of Target Fund held immediately prior to the transaction. \n3\nPLR-116161-99\n(d)  Acquiring has no plan or intention to reacquire any of its stock issued in the\ntransaction.\n(e)  Acquiring has no plan or intention to sell or otherwise dispose of any of the assets\nof Target Fund acquired in the transaction, except for dispositions made in the ordinary\ncourse of business or transfers described in section 368(a)(2)(C) of the Code.\n(f) Target Fund will distribute to its shareholders the stock of Acquiring received\npursuant to the Plan of Reorganization.\n(g) The liabilities of Target Fund assumed by Acquiring and any liabilities to which the\ntransferred assets of Target Fund are subject were incurred by Target Fund in the\nordinary course of its business.\n(h) Following the Reorganization, Acquiring will continue the historic business of Target\nFund or use a significant portion of Target Fund\u2019s historic business assets in the\ncontinuing business.\n(i) Target Fund, Acquiring and the shareholders of Target Fund will pay their respective\nexpenses, if any, incurred in connection with the Reorganization.\n(j) There is no intercorporate indebtedness existing between Target Fund and Acquiring\nthat was issued, acquired, or will be settled at a discount.\n(k) Target Fund and Acquiring qualify as a regulated investment companies as defined\nin section 368(a)(2)(F)(i) and (ii) of the Code.\n(l) The fair market value of the assets of Target Fund transferred to Acquiring will equal\nor exceed the sum of the liabilities assumed by Acquiring.\n(m)  Acquiring does not own, directly or indirectly, nor has it owned during the past five\nyears, directly or indirectly, any stock of Target Fund.\n(n) Cash is being distributed to shareholders of Target Fund in lieu of fractional shares\nof Acquiring solely to save Acquiring the expense and inconvenience of issuing and\ntransferring fractional shares, and such cash does not represent separately bargained\nfor consideration in the Reorganization.  The total cash consideration that will be paid in\neach transaction between Acquiring and Target Fund to the Target Fund shareholders\ninstead of issuing fractional shares of Acquiring stock will not exceed one percent of the\ntotal consideration that will be issued in the transaction to Target Fund shareholders in\nexchange for their shares of Target Fund stock.  The fractional share interests of each\nshareholder of Target Fund will be aggregated, and no Target shareholder will receive\ncash in an amount equal to or greater than the value of one full share of Acquiring\nstock.\n4\nPLR-116161-99\n(o) Target Fund is not under the jurisdiction of a court in a Title 11 or similar case within\nthe meaning of section 368(a)(3)(A).\n(p) Target Fund and Acquiring have elected to be taxed as RICs under \u00a7 851, and for\nall of their taxable periods (including the last short taxable period ending on the date of\nReorganization for Target Fund), have qualified for the special tax treatment afforded\nRICs under the Code.  After the Reorganization, Acquiring intends to continue to so\nqualify.\n(q) There is no plan or intention by Acquiring or any person related (as defined in \n\u00a7 1.368-1(e)(3)) to Acquiring to acquire any of the stock of Acquiring issued in the\ntransaction either directly or through any transaction, agreement, or arrangement with\nany other person.\n(r)  During the five-year period ending on the date of the proposed transaction, Target\nFund nor any person related to Target Fund (as defined in \u00a7 1.368-1(e)(3) of the\nIncome Tax Regulations without regard to section 1.368-1(e)(3)(i)(A)) will have directly\nor through any transaction, agreement, or arrangement with any other person, (i)\nacquired stock of Target Fund with consideration other than shares of Acquiring or\nTarget Fund, or (ii) made distributions with respect to Target Fund stock, except for (a)\ndistributions described in \u00a7\u00a7 852 and 4982 of the Code, and (b) additional distributions,\nto the extent such distributions do not exceed 50 percent of the value (without giving\neffect to such distributions) of the proprietary interest in Target Fund on the effective\ndate of the proposed transaction.\n(s)  Prior to or in the transaction, neither Acquiring nor any person related to Acquiring\n(as defined in 1.368-1(e)(3)) will have acquired directly or through any transaction,\nagreement or arrangement with any other person, stock of Target Fund with\nconsideration other than shares of Acquiring.  \n(t) Acquiring and Target Fund is incorporated under the laws of State X and is\nregistered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (\u201c1940 Act\u201d) as non-diversified,\nleveraged closed-end investment companies.  Non-Diversified within the meaning of the\n1940 Act means that investment companies are not limited in the proportion of assets\nthat they may invest in the securities of a single issuer.  Acquiring and the Target Fund\nare, however, managed so as to meet the diversification requirements of \u00a7 851(b)(3) of\nthe Code and qualify for tax treatment as RICs. \n(u)  There is no plan or intention for Acquiring (the issuing corporation as defined in \n\u00a7 1.368-1(b)), or any person related (as defined in \u00a7 1.368-1(e)(3)) to Acquiring, to\nacquire, during the five year period beginning on the date of the proposed transaction,\nwith consideration other than Acquiring stock, Acquiring stock furnished in exchange for\na proprietary interest in Target Fund in the proposed transaction, either directly or\nthrough any transaction, agreement, or arrangement with any other person, except for\n5\nPLR-116161-99\ncash distributed to the Target Fund\u2019s common shareholders in lieu of fractional shares\nof Acquiring common stock.\n(v)  During the five year period ending on the date of the proposed transaction:  \n(i)  neither Acquiring, nor any person related (as defined in \u00a7 1.368-1(e)(3)) to\nAcquiring, will have acquired Target Fund\u2019s stock\u0003with consideration other than\nAcquiring stock;  (ii) Target Fund, nor any person related (as defined in \u00a7 1.368-1(e)(3)\ndetermined without regard to \u00a7 1.368-1(e)(3)(i)(A)) to Target Fund, will have acquired\nsuch Target Fund\u2019s stock with consideration other than Acquiring stock or Target\nFund\u2019s stock;  and (iii)  no distributions will have been made with respect to Target\nFund\u2019s stock (other than ordinary, normal, regular, dividend distributions made pursuant\nto target\u2019s historic dividend paying practice), either directly or through any transaction,\nagreement, or arrangement with any other person, except for a) cash paid to dissenters\nand b) distributions described in \u00a7\u00a7 852 and 4982 of the Code, as required for Target\nFund\u2019s tax treatment as a RIC.\n(w) The aggregate value of the acquisitions, redemptions and distributions discussed in\nparagraphs (u) and (v), above, will not exceed 50 percent of the value (without giving\neffect to the acquisitions, redemptions and distributions) of the proprietary interest in\nTarget Fund on the effective date of the proposed transaction.\n(x)  The Acquiring preferred stock received by Target Fund preferred stockholders will\nbe substantially identical (as defined in Prop. Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.356-7(b)(2), 65 Fed. Reg.\n4203 (2000)) to the Target Fund preferred stock surrendered in exchange therefor.\nBased solely upon the information and representations set forth above, we hold\nas follows:\n(1)\nThe acquisition by Acquiring of substantially all of the assets of Target Fund\nsolely for Acquring voting stock and the assumption by Acquiring of the liabilities\nof Target Fund, as described above, will qualify as a reorganization within the\nmeaning of \u00a7 368(a)(1)(C) of the Code.  \u201cSubstantially all\u201d means at least 90% of\nthe fair market value of the net assets and at least 70% of the fair market value\nof the gross assets of Target Fund.  Acquiring and Target Fund will each be \u201ca\nparty to a reorganization\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 368(b).\n(2)\nNo gain or loss will be recognized by Target Fund upon the transfer of\nsubstantially all of its assets to Acquiring solely in exchange for Acquiring voting\ncommon stock (\u00a7 361(a)).\n(3)\nNo gain or loss will be recognized by Target Fund upon the distribution of such\nAcquiring stock to Target Fund shareholders (\u00a7 361(c)). \n(4)\nAcquiring will not recognize any gain or loss on the receipt of the assets of\n6\nPLR-116161-99\nTarget Fund in exchange for voting shares of Acquiring (\u00a71032(a)).\n(5)\nThe basis of Target Fund assets in the hands of Acquiring will be the same as\nthe basis of those assets in the hands of Target Fund immediately prior to the\nexchange (\u00a7362(b)).\n(6)\nThe holding period of Target Fund assets in the hands of Acquiring will include\nthe period during which such assets were held by Target Fund (\u00a7 1223(2)).\n(7)\nThe common and preferred shareholders of Target Fund will not recognize any\ngain or loss on their receipt of common and preferred stock of Acquiring\n(including fractional share interests to which they may be entitled) solely in\nexchange for their Target Fund shares, as described above (\u00a7 354(a)(1)).\n(8)\nThe basis of the Acquiring shares (including fractional share interests to which\nthey may be entitled) received by Target Fund shareholders will be the same as\nthe basis of the Target Fund shares surrendered in exchange therefor (\u00a7\n358(a)(1)).\n(9)\nThe holding period of the Acquiring shares (including fractional share interests to\nwhich they may be entitled) received by Target Fund shareholders in exchange\nfor their Target Fund shares will include the period during which the exchanged\nTarget Fund shares were held, provided that the Target Fund shares are held as\na capital asset in the hands of the Target Fund shareholders on the date of the\nexchange (\u00a71223(1)).\n(10)\nThe payment of cash to Target Fund shareholders in lieu of fractional shares of\nAcquiring will be treated as though the fractional shares were distributed as part\nof the Reorganization and then redeemed by Acquiring.  The cash payment will\nbe treated as a distribution in full payment for the fractional shares deemed\nredeemed under \u00a7 302(a), with the result that Target Fund shareholders will\nhave short-term or long-term capital gain or loss to the extent that the cash\ndistribution differs from the basis allocable to their fractional shares.\n(11)\nPursuant to \u00a7 381(b) of the Code and \u00a7 1.381(a)-1 of the Income Tax\nRegulations, the tax year of Target Fund will end on the effective date of the\ntransfer. \n(12)\nAcquiring will succeed to and take into account the items of Target Fund\ndescribed in \u00a7 381(c) of the Code, subject to the provisions and limitations\nspecified in \u00a7\u00a7 381, 382, 383 and 384 of the Code and the regulations\nthereunder.\nNo opinion is expressed about the federal income tax treatment of the proposed\n7\nPLR-116161-99\ntransaction under other provisions of the Code and regulations or about the tax\ntreatment of any conditions existing at the time of, or effects resulting from, the\nproposed transaction that are not specifically covered by the above rulings. \nExcept as expressly provided herein, no opinion is expressed or implied\nconcerning the tax consequences of any aspect of any transaction or item discussed or\nreferenced in this letter.  Specifically, no opinion was requested, and none is expressed,\nabout whether Acquiring or Target Fund qualify as RICs that are taxable under\nSubchapter M, Part I of the Code.\nThis ruling is directed only to the taxpayer(s) requesting it.

X intends to \nform Y under the laws of State and cause Y to become a publicly traded partnership \nwithin the meaning of \u00a7 7704(b).  X represents that Y will earn income by providing \nservices to oil and natural gas producers critical to the producers\u2019 ability to retrieve \notherwise inaccessible oil and gas reserves.  Specifically, Y will earn income by \nproviding essential fluid, solids, and other oilfield waste handling, treatment, and \ndisposal services necessary for its customers\u2019 use of the fracturing technique of oil and \nnatural gas extraction.  X intends that Y provide such services through affiliated \noperating limited partnerships, limited liability companies, or disregarded entities.\nFracturing is a technique by which fluids are pumped into an oil or gas well at \nhigh pressure to fracture geologic formations and open up pathways for the oil or gas to \nflow up for extraction.

Y also will provide heating \nservices with respect to such fluids using superheaters and hot oilers.  In addition, Y will \ntreat and dispose of completion fluids, drilling muds, drill cuttings, contaminated soil, \ntank bottoms, produced water, pit water, fracturing fluid and flowback which result from \nthe use of the fracturing process in compliance with environmental regulations.  Y will \nalso remove and treat fluids used to wash and remove debris from containers, trucks, \nand equipment used by the oil and gas producers.\nIn addition to its provision of fluids and waste removal, treatment, recycling, and \ndisposal services, Y will earn income from hydrocarbon remediation services.  Y will \nremove such hydrocarbons from drilling waste at its treatment facilities during the waste \ntreatment and disposal process.  Y will then sell such reclaimed hydrocarbons on \nrelevant markets.  X represents that Y does not intend to market reclaimed \nhydrocarbons to end users at the retail level and, to the extent that Y earns income from \nthe marketing of reclaimed hydrocarbons to end-users at the retail level, Y will treat \nsuch income as non-qualifying income under \u00a7 7704(d)(1)(E).    \nX also represents that Y will provide what it refers to as further \u201cmiscellaneous \nservices\u201d related to and in support of its primary fluid handling business.  Y will earn \nincome from the provision of refined fuels, such as diesel, to oil and natural gas \nproducers for use in their exploration and production activities.  X represents that Y\ndoes not intend to provide refined fuels to end-users at the retail level, and, to the extent \nthat Y earns income from the provision of refined fuels to end users at the retail level, Y\nwill treat such income as non-qualifying income under \u00a7 7704(d)(1)(E).  Furthermore, to \nsupport this business, Y will design, own, manage, and operate rail and rail \ntransportation assets.  Y also will design, develop, own, operate, license and manage \ncommunications technology which will provide remote monitoring capabilities to oil and \nnatural gas producers and early detection of problems with the pumps and recovery \nfacilities used in the production activities.  Finally, because oil and natural gas \ncompanies as well as oil and gas pipeline operators are required by law at both the \nfederal and the state level to inspect their oil and gas pipelines and gathering systems \non a regular basis to protect the environment and ensure public safety, Y will provide \ninfrastructure inspection services.\nLAW\nSection 7704(a) provides that a publicly traded partnership shall be treated as a \ncorporation.\nSection 7704(b) provides that the term \u201cpublicly traded partnership\u201d means any \npartnership if (1) interests in that partnership are traded on an established securities \nmarket, or (2) interest in that partnership are readily tradable on a secondary market (or \nsubstantial equivalent thereof).\nPLR-152307-12\n3\nSection 7704(c)(1) provides that \u00a7 7701(a) shall not apply to any publicly traded \npartnership for any taxable year if such partnership met the gross income requirements \nof \u00a7 7704(c)(2) for such taxable year and each preceding taxable year beginning after \nDecember 31, 1987, during which the partnership (or any predecessor) was in \nexistence.\nSection 7704(c)(2) explains that a partnership meets the gross income \nrequirements of \u00a7 7704(c)(2) for any taxable year if 90 percent or more of the gross \nincome of such partnership for such taxable year is qualifying income.\nSection 7704(d)(1)(E) provides that the term \u201cqualifying income\u201d includes income \nor gains derived from the exploration, development, mining or production, processing, \nrefining, transportation (including pipelines transporting gas, oil, or products thereof), or \nthe marketing of any mineral or natural resource (including fertilizer, geothermal energy, \nor timber).\nThe Conference Report accompanying the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of \n1987, in discussing the type of qualifying income described in \u00a7 7704(d)(1)(E), provides \nthe following:\nIncome and gains from certain activities with respect to minerals or natural \nresources are treated as passive-type income.  Specifically, natural resources \ninclude fertilizer, geothermal energy, and timber, as well as oil, gas or products \nthereof ... For this purpose, oil, gas, or products thereof means gasoline, \nkerosene, number 2 fuel oil, refined lubricating oils, diesel fuel, methane, butane, \npropane, and similar products which are recovered from petroleum refineries or \noil field facilities.  Oil, gas, or products thereof are not intended to encompass oil \nor gas products that are produced by additional processing beyond that of \npetroleum refineries or field facilities, such as plastics or similar petroleum \nderivatives.  Income of certain partnerships whose exclusive activities are \ntransportation and marketing activities is not treated as passive-type income.  For \nexample, the income of a partnership whose exclusive activity is transporting \nrefined petroleum products by pipeline is intended to be treated as passive-type \nincome, but the income of a partnership whose exclusive activities are \ntransporting refined petroleum products by truck, or retail marketing with respect \nto refined petroleum products (e.g., gas station operations) is not intended to be \ntreated as passive type income.\nH.R.

By contrast, income from marketing minerals and natural resources to end \nusers at the retail level is not intended to be qualifying income.  For example, \nincome from retail marketing with respect to refined petroleum products (e.g., gas \nstation operations) is not intended to be treated as qualifying income.\nS. Rep. No. 445, 100th Cong., 2d Sess. 424 (1988).\nCONCLUSION\nBased solely on the facts presented and representations made, we conclude that \nY\u2019s gross income from the removal, treatment, recycling, and disposal of fracturing \nflowback, produced water, and other residual waste products generated by oil and gas \nwells during the fracturing process is qualifying income within the meaning of \n\u00a7 7704(d)(1)(E).  \nWe further conclude that the income derived from the marketing and distribution \nof salvaged hydrocarbons, excluding income earned from marketing minerals and \nnatural resources to end users at the retail level, will also constitute qualifying income \nwithin the meaning of \u00a7 7704(d)(1)(E).  \nFinally, we conclude that, to the extent the \u201cmiscellaneous services\u201d described \nabove are provided to customers engaged in drilling, exploration and production, \ntransportation, or mining of a mineral or natural resource for use in those activities, \nexcluding income earned from providing such services with respect to end users at the \nretail level, Y\u2019s gross income from the provision of those services is qualifying income \nwithin the meaning of \u00a7 7704(d)(1)(E). \nExcept as expressly provided herein, no opinion is expressed or implied \nconcerning the tax consequences of any aspect of any transaction or item discussed or \nreferenced in this letter.  In particular, no opinion is expressed as to whether Y meets \nthe 90 percent gross income requirement in \u00a7 7704(c).  To the extent that Y\u2019s gross \nincome from its activities described above are not attributable to its customer\u2019s \n\u00a7 7704(d)(1)(E) activities (i.e., to activities of the customer, such as drilling, exploration \nand production, transportation, or mining of a mineral or natural resources, that would \ngenerally be expected to produce gross income that is qualifying under \u00a7 7704(d)(1)(E) \nregardless of the customer\u2019s Federal tax classification), this letter will not apply in \ndetermining whether the income that may be derived by X from such other uses \nconstitutes qualifying income under \u00a7 7704(d)(1)(E).   \nThis ruling is directed only to the taxpayer requesting it.

The Corporations assist low \nand moderate income individuals to obtain adequate and affordable housing within \ncertain areas in State that have been identified as in moderate or high need for \ncommunity stabilization.  Corporation A and Corporation B provide assistance in Area A \nand Area B, respectively.  The Corporations implement various programs intended to \ncounteract housing deterioration in these communities.  The Corporations operate in \ncooperation with, or on behalf of, various State and local governmental agencies, and \nneighborhood organizations. \nAs of Date 1, the Corporations jointly operate a home ownership program (the \n\u201cProgram\u201d) that provides financing directly to low and moderate income borrowers for \nthe purchase of single-family owner-occupied homes (the \u201cLoans\u201d).  To qualify for a \nLoan, a borrower must be ineligible for conforming market rate mortgage financing and \nmust meet certain income requirements.  At least a percent of the Loans must be \nprovided to borrowers with incomes less than b percent of the area median income as \ndetermined by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (\u201cHUD\u201d).  To \ndate, less than c percent of borrowers had incomes above b percent of HUD area \nmedian income and more than d percent had incomes below a percent.  Homes \npurchased through the Program are located in one of several Target Areas identified as \nin need of community stabilization.  \nThe Loans are currently in the form of contracts for deeds, or land installment contracts, \nthat are treated as mortgages for federal income tax purposes.  The Program might be \nexpanded in the future to include conventional mortgages.  The maximum principal \namount of a Loan is $e, and since inception of the Program, the average principal \namount of a Loan has been $f.  The Loans have maturities of 10 years and bear fixed \ninterest rates.  One of the Program\u2019s goals is to assist the borrower in ultimately \nrefinancing into a 30-year mortgage.  The Program has implemented safeguards to \nmitigate a borrower\u2019s risk of default on a Loan, including extensive screening, financial \ncounseling through a non-profit community-based counseling service, education, and \nPLR-123088-13\n3\nother assistance in the event that the borrower experiences financial difficulty (including \npossible modification of a payment plan).  \n   \nThe Program is funded by charitable contributions and debt financing from the State \nhousing finance agency, quasi-governmental and other housing non-profit entities, \nprivate sector donors, and investors.  Credit enhancement for debt issued to fund the \nProgram is often provided by several cities and counties in State, as well as nonprofit \norganization Entity A.  \nThe Corporations wish to expand the Program to include the issuance of multiple \nmaturity debt financing (the \u201cNotes\u201d) secured by a pledge of the Loans.  The \nCorporations have jointly established a special purpose limited liability company \n(\u201cProgram LLC\u201d) in order to issue the Notes.  Program LLC is a nonprofit limited liability \ncompany organized under the law of State, the membership interests in which are \nowned by the Corporations through their wholly-owned disregarded entities, Corporation \nA LLC and Corporation B LLC.  The Corporations represent that they may establish \nadditional limited liability companies in the future.  The Corporations represent that \nProgram LLC will issue the Notes in multiple tranches with different maturity dates and \ninterest rates in order to attract a broader base of investors with varied investment \ngoals, which will expand the capacity of the Program to originate Loans.  Under the \nrelated debt financing agreements, the Corporations may be required (or permitted) to \nrepurchase a Loan in the event of a breach of certain representations, warranties or \ncovenants in the related debt financing agreement if such breach materially affects the \nvalue of the Loan.  In general, the lenders (or their agent) have the right to enforce the \nrepurchase obligation against the Corporations (or related party).  If a Loan is \nrepurchased, it will have no impact on the ability of the borrower to remain in \npossession of her home.  The Corporations have the right to exercise various remedies \nagainst the borrower if she is in default under a Loan.\nInvestors in the Notes are expected to include the State finance agency, quasi-\ngovernmental and other housing non-profit entities, and private sector investors.  Credit \nenhancement for the Notes is expected to continue to be provided by several cities and \ncounties in State, as well as nonprofit organization Entity A.  The proceeds of the Notes \nwill be used exclusively for the acquisition of homes eligible for inclusion in the Program, \nand the origination or purchase of Loans.  The Corporations request a ruling that \nProgram LLC\u2019s financing of pledged Loans with debt instruments having multiple \nmaturities does not cause the LLC to be a taxable mortgage pool under section 7701(i) \nof the Code.\nThe Corporations represent that, with respect to any Notes issued by Program LLC that \nwould cause Program LLC to be a taxable mortgage pool but for the requested ruling, \nProgram LLC will hold, either directly or indirectly through an indenture trustee or other \ncustodian who will hold the pledged Loans to satisfy the Notes, the remaining beneficial \ninterest in all assets that support the Notes until they are retired.\nPLR-123088-13\n4\nLAW AND ANALYSIS:\nSection 7701(i)(1) provides that a taxable mortgage pool shall be treated as a separate \ncorporation which may not be treated as an includible corporation with any other \ncorporation for purposes of section 1501.\nSection 7701(i)(2)(A) provides that in general, a taxable mortgage pool is any entity \n(other than a REMIC) if (i) substantially all of the assets of such entity consists of debt \nobligations (or interests therein) and more than 50 percent of such debt obligations (or \ninterests) consists of real estate mortgages (or interests therein), (ii) such entity is the \nobligor under debt obligations with 2 or more maturities, and (iii) under the terms of the \ndebt obligations referred to in clause (ii) (or underlying arrangement), payments on such \ndebt obligations bear a relationship to payments on the debt obligations (or interests) \nreferred to in clause (i).  \nSection 7701(i)(2)(B) provides that any portion of an entity which meets the definition of \nsubparagraph (A) shall be treated as a taxable mortgage pool (\u201cTMP\u201d).\nSection 301.7701(i)-4(a)(1) of the Procedure and Administration Regulations excludes \ncertain governmental bond programs from the TMP rules.  It provides that regardless of \nwhether an entity satisfies any of the requirements of section 7701(i)(2)(A), an entity is \nnot classified as a TMP if - (i) The entity is a State, territory, a possession of the United \nStates, the District of Columbia, or any political subdivision thereof (within the meaning \nof \u00a7 1.103-1(b) of this chapter), or is empowered to issue obligations on behalf of one of \nthe foregoing; (ii) The entity issues the debt obligations in the performance of a \ngovernmental purpose; and (iii) The entity holds the remaining interests in all assets that \nsupport those debt obligations until the debt obligations issued by the entity are retired. \nThe term \u201cgovernmental purpose\u201d means an essential governmental function within the \nmeaning of section 115 and does not include mere packaging of debt obligations for \nresale in the secondary market.  \u00a7 301.7701(i)-4(a)(2).  \nSection 301.7701(i)-4(a)(3) provides that if an entity is not described in paragraph (a)(1) \nof this section, but has a similar purpose, then the Commissioner may determine that \nthe entity is not classified as a taxable mortgage pool.\nNeither of the Corporations nor Program LLC are an entity described in section \n301.7701(i)-4(a)(1)(i).  Nevertheless Program LLC may qualify for an exemption from \nthe TMP rules pursuant to section 301.7701(i)-4(a)(3), if it is found that the issuance of \nthe Notes has a similar purpose as described in section 301.7701(i)-4(a)(1)(ii), that is, \nProgram LLC\u2019s purpose in issuing Notes is to issue debt obligations in the performance \nof a governmental purpose and Program LLC meets the requirements of section \nPLR-123088-13\n5\n301.7701(i)-4(a)(1)(iii).  In order to meet the requirement of \u201cperformance of a \ngovernmental purpose,\u201d Program LLC must satisfy the requirements under section \n301.7701(i)-4(a)(2) that the issuance of the Notes (1) is in performance of an essential \ngovernmental function within the meaning of section 115 and (2) is not the mere \npackaging of debt obligations for resale in the secondary market.   \nIn providing an exclusion from gross income, section 115 requires, among other things, \nthat the income be derived in \u201cthe exercise of any essential governmental function.\u201d\nRev. Rul. 77-261, 1977-2 C.B. 45, holds, \u201cIncome from a fund, established under a \nwritten declaration of trust by a State, for the temporary investment of cash balances of \nthe State and its political subdivisions . . . is excludable from gross income . . . .\u201d  The \nruling reasons that the \u201cinvestment of positive cash balances . . . in order to receive \nsome yield on the funds until needed to meet expenses is a necessary incident of the \npower of the State or political subdivision to collect taxes and other revenues for use in \nmeeting governmental expenses.\u201d  In addressing the meaning of an \u201cessential \ngovernmental function\u201d for purposes of section 115, the ruling states, \u201cCongress did not \ndesire in any way to restrict a State\u2019s participation in enterprises that might be useful in \ncarrying out those projects desirable from the standpoint of the State government which, \non a broad consideration of the question, may be the function of the sovereign to \nconduct.\u201d\nCONCLUSION:\nBased on the information submitted and representations made, we conclude that \nCorporation A and Corporation B have satisfied the requirements under section \n301.7701(i)-4(a)(1) for Program LLC to be exempt from the TMP rules under the facts \nand circumstances.  Program LLC will hold, either directly or indirectly through an \nindenture trustee or other custodian, the remaining interests in Loans that support Notes \nissued by Program LLC until those Notes are retired.  The activities of the Corporations \nand Program LLC provide funding to enable low and moderate income individuals to \nborrow the money they need to purchase housing in communities identified as in need \nof stabilization.  Neither the Corporations nor Program LLC are in the business of \npurchasing and selling of debt obligations on the secondary market, rather Program \nLLC will function as the direct issuer of such bonds.  Accordingly, Program LLC\u2019s \nissuance of Notes is in the performance of a governmental purpose for purposes of \nsection 301.7701(i)-4(a)(2) because (1) its activities qualify as an \u201cessential \ngovernmental function\u201d under section 115, and (2) its issuance of Notes is not \u201cthe mere \npackaging of debt obligations for resale on the secondary market.\u201d\nThis ruling is limited to the exemption of Program LLC\u2019s issuance of Notes from the \nTMP rules under section 301.7701(i)-4.  This ruling's application is limited to the facts, \nrepresentations, Code sections, and regulations cited herein.  No opinion is expressed \nwith regard to whether Program LLC could meet the requirements of a REMIC under \nPLR-123088-13\n6\nsection 860D(a), whether Program LLC would otherwise be a TMP under section \n7701(i), whether it is otherwise exempt under section 501(c)(3), or whether Program \nLLC\u2019s issuance of Notes satisfies either the accrual requirement or the private benefit \nrequirement of section 115.  \nExcept as expressly provided herein, no opinion is expressed or implied concerning the \ntax consequences of any aspect of any transaction or item discussed or referenced in \nthis letter.\nThis ruling is directed only to the taxpayer that requested it.  Section 6110(k)(3) \nprovides that it may not be used or cited as precedent.  In accordance with the \nprovisions of a Power of Attorney on file, we are sending a copy of this ruling letter to \nyour authorized representative.\nThe rulings contained in this letter are based upon information and representations \nsubmitted by the taxpayer and accompanied by a penalty of perjury statement executed \nby an appropriate party.   While this office has not verified any of the material submitted \nin support of the request for rulings, it is subject to verification on examination.\nSincerely\nMary Brewer\nAssistant to the Branch Chief\nOffice of Chief Counsel, Branch 6\n(Financial Institutions & Products)\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Non-Adverse"}]}

Proc. 2003-1, \u00a7 12.04.\nCompany is a State A corporation engaged in Business A.  On Date 3, the date\nof death of Decedent, Company had outstanding A shares of voting common stock, B\nshares of nonvoting common stock, C shares cumulative voting preferred stock (which\nbecame nonvoting at Decedent\u2019s death), and D shares of nonvoting preferred stock. \nOn Date 3: over half of the voting common stock was held by Decedent\u2019s daughter\n(\u201cDaughter\u201d); over half of both the voting and nonvoting preferred stock (m shares\nvoting and n shares nonvoting) was held by a revocable trust (\u201cRevocable Trust\u201d).  All\nthe other stock in Company is held by, or for the benefit of, Decedent\u2019s children and\ngrandchildren, and/or persons married to the children. \nDecedent, a State B resident, died on Date 3 survived by Daughter, Son, and\nthree grandchildren.  On Decedent\u2019s Form 706, United States Estate (and Generation\nSkipping Transfer) Tax Return, the executor of Decedent\u2019s estate (\u201cEstate\u201d) elected to\ndeduct the value of Decedent\u2019s qualified family-owned business interests (\u201cQFOBI\u201d)\nunder section 2057 of the Internal Revenue Code, and claimed the maximum allowable\n$675,000 deduction.  Decedent\u2019s QFOBI consisted of the Company stock (m shares of\nvoting preferred and n shares of nonvoting preferred) held by Decedent indirectly\nthrough Revocable Trust.  By a letter dated Date 4, the Internal Revenue Service\naccepted Decedent\u2019s estate tax return.\nRevocable Trust was established on Date 1 through an agreement between\nDecedent (as grantor) and Decedent and his wife (as trustees).  On Date 2, Decedent\namended and restated Revocable Trust in its entirety, with Revocable Trust being\nestablished for the benefit of Decedent, Daughter, and other descendants of Decedent. \nPursuant to Article VI, section D of Revocable Trust, the property passing under Articles\nIII and IV bears the excess costs, including funeral and estate administration expenses,\ndeath taxes, pre-residuary gifts, and certain other charges.  On Decedent\u2019s death,\nRevocable Trust ceased to be revocable.  Daughter and an independent trustee are the\ntwo trustees of this trust.\nOn Date 2, Decedent executed a will.  Article II of Decedent\u2019s will provides that\nDecedent\u2019s tangible personal property is to be distributed in accordance with any\nmemoranda signed and dated by Decedent which disposes of any of Decedent\u2019s\ntangible personal property.  Except as otherwise devised, Decedent gives and devises\nhis tangible personal property, along with any insurance policies relating thereto, to\nDaughter, if she survives Decedent.  Article III of Decedent\u2019s will provides that\nDecedent\u2019s residuary estate is to be distributed to the then serving trustees of the\nRevocable Trust.  \nArticle V, section B of Decedent\u2019s will provides that any estate, legacy,\nsuccession, inheritance, transfer, excise (including any excise tax imposed under\nsection 4980A) and other similar taxes (including any generation-skipping transfer tax)\nimposed by reason of Decedent\u2019s death, together with any interest and penalties\n4\nPLR-104741-03\nthereon, referred to therein as \u201cdeath taxes,\u201d are to be paid as follows: (1) All death\ntaxes, other than any generation-skipping transfer tax imposed upon or with respect to\nproperty which passes (i) under the will, or (ii) to or under the Revocable Trust is to be\npaid out of Decedent\u2019s general estate as an administration expense, without proration\nor apportionment against any recipient thereof and without any statutory rights to\nrecover any amounts so paid.  (2) All other death taxes are to be prorated and\napportioned in the manner provided by law.  Article V, section C of Decedent\u2019s will\nprovides that funeral, medical, and administration expenses are to be paid out of his\ngeneral estate.  Article V, section D of the will provides that Decedent\u2019s \u201cresiduary\nestate\u201d is to consist of all of Decedent\u2019s property wherever located (except any property\nover which Decedent had a power of appointment, it being Decedent\u2019s intention not to\nexercise any such power by the disposition of the residuary estate), remaining after\npayment of all debts, funeral and administration expenses and death taxes as provided\nin this article, any pre-residuary gifts and any other charges payable out of the principal\nof Decedent\u2019s general estate.  Article V, section E of the will provides that if the assets\nof Decedent\u2019s general estate (exclusive of residential real property and tangible\npersonal property) are insufficient or too illiquid to pay decedent\u2019s funeral and\nadministration expenses or any death taxes required by this article to be paid out of\nDecedent\u2019s general estate as an administration expense, Decedent\u2019s personal\nrepresentative is to make a written request to the trustees of the Revocable Trust to\ndistribute to Decedent\u2019s personal representative, or pay directly from the principal of\nthat trust, such amount as may be necessary to pay such expenses and death taxes.\nArticle II of the Revocable Trust, as amended, provides for the administration of\nthe trust upon Decedent\u2019s death, with the trust then termed the Terminating Trust. \nArticle II, section B of the Revocable Trust provides that if the Terminating Trust\ncontains any stock of Company, then such stock is to be disposed of as follows: (1) the\ntrustees are to distribute the Company voting preferred stock as follows: (a) if Son\nsurvives Decedent, then the voting preferred stock is to be held by trustees in a\nseparate trust pursuant to Article III of the agreement;  (2) the trustees are to distribute\nthe Company nonvoting preferred stock pursuant to Article IV of the agreement.  Article\nII, section C provides that the balance of the Terminating Trust remaining after the\ndistributions directed under the preceding sections of Article II, referred to in the\nagreement as Decedent\u2019s \u201cresiduary estate,\u201d is to be disposed of pursuant to Article V\nof the agreement.\nArticle III of the Revocable Trust provides for the establishment of a separate\ntrust for the benefit of Son, Son\u2019s descendants, and Son\u2019s wife.  Upon the death of the\nlast to die of Son and Son\u2019s wife, the trustees are to distribute the principal of this trust,\ntogether with all accrued or collected but undistributed income, to Daughter, if she is\nthen living.  If Daughter is not then living, then the trust assets are to be distributed\npursuant to a special power of appointment exercised by Daughter.\nArticle IV of the Revocable Trust provides for the establishment of a separate\ntrust to be funded with a fractional share of the property allocated to Article IV, the\n5\nPLR-104741-03\nnumerator of which equals Decedent\u2019s unused GST exemption [see section 2631,\ndealing with the generation-skipping transfer tax exemption], and the denominator of\nwhich equals the value of the property allocated to this article as finally determined for\nfederal estate tax purposes.  The trustees may pay or apply all or any part of the net\nincome and principal thereof to or for the benefit of Daughter and Daughter\u2019s\ndescendants in such proportions as the trustees in their discretion consider advisable\nfor any eligible beneficiary\u2019s maintenance in health and reasonable comfort, education,\nor support in such eligible beneficiary\u2019s accustomed manner of living.  If Daughter\nsurvives Decedent, then upon Daughter\u2019s death the trustees are to distribute the\nremaining trust assets pursuant to a special power of appointment exercised by\nDaughter.\nArticle V of the Revocable Trust provides for the disposition of Decedent\u2019s\nresiduary estate.  Section A of this article provides that the trustees are to pay\nDecedent\u2019s debts, death taxes, and expenses as provided by Article VI.  Section B of\nArticle V provides for the distribution of the balance of Decedent\u2019s residuary estate as\nfollows: (1) if Daughter or any of her descendants survive Decedent, an equal share is\nto be disposed of pursuant to Article IV; and (2) one equal share is to be distributed to\nSon, if Son survives Decedent, or if he does not survive Decedent, to Son\u2019s\ndescendants who survive Decedent, per stirpes. \nArticle VI, section A of Revocable Trust provides that upon Decedent\u2019s death,\nthe trustees are to pay to or on behalf of Decedent\u2019s executor out of the principal of the\nresiduary estate, such amounts as the personal representative requests in writing for\nDecedent\u2019s funeral expenses, the expenses of administering Decedent\u2019s estate, and\nany estate, legacy, succession, inheritance, transfer, excise (including any excise tax\nimposed under section 4980A) and other similar taxes (including any generation-\nskipping transfer tax) imposed by reason of Decedent\u2019s death, together with any\ninterest and penalties thereon, referred to in this article as \u201cdeath taxes,\u201d that are\nrequired by Decedent\u2019s will to be paid out of Decedent\u2019s general estate as an\nadministration expense. \nArticle VI, section D of Revocable Trust provides that to the extent that\nDecedent\u2019s residuary estate is not sufficient to pay all of the expenses and death taxes\nas provided in Article VI, sections A and B, then the amount of such expenses and\ndeath taxes described in Article VI, sections A and B, which are not paid from\nDecedent\u2019s residuary estate (\u201cexcess costs\u201d) are to be paid as follows: (1) the property\npassing under Articles III and IV of this agreement is to bear a proportionate share of\nthe excess costs.  The proportionate share of the excess costs payable from the\nproperty passing under each such article is to equal a fraction of the excess costs, the\nnumerator of which is the fair market value of the property passing under such article as\nfinally determined for federal estate tax purposes, and the denominator of which is the\nfair market value of the property passing under both Articles III and IV as finally\ndetermined for federal estate tax purposes.  (2) The excess costs payable out of the\nproperty passing under Article IV of this agreement is to be paid first from the property\npassing under Article IV, section B, and then, to the extent that the property passing\n6\nPLR-104741-03\nunder Article IV, section B is not sufficient to pay all of the excess costs payable out of\nthe property passing under Article IV, from the property passing under Article IV,\nsection A.\nTerminating Trust, which was created under Article II of Revocable Trust,\nbecame the holder of the m shares of voting preferred stock and n shares of nonvoting\npreferred stock following the death of Decedent.  \nThe m shares of voting preferred stock and n shares of nonvoting preferred\nstock held by Revocable Trust prior to Decedent\u2019s death (which were included in\nDecedent\u2019s taxable estate) were valued at $e  and $v  (a total of $ev) on Decedent\u2019s\nForm 706.  On audit of the Form 706, the value of the m shares of voting preferred\nstock was increased from $e to $a.  Thus, the total audit value of the Company stock\nincluded in Decedent\u2019s Estate, $a plus $v, was $av.\nThe value of Decedent\u2019s gross estate is $h.  The amount allowable as a\ndeduction to Estate under sections 2053 and 2054 is $i.  The value of the gross estate\nless the deductions (h minus i) is $j.  The $av value of the Company stock included in\nEstate is p percent of the $j total value of the gross estate less deductions.\nThe federal and State B estate, inheritance, legacy, and succession taxes\nimposed because of Decedent\u2019s death totaled $t.  The amount of funeral and\nadministrative expenses totaled $fa.  Together the $fa expenses and $t taxes totaled\n$fat.\nIt is now proposed that Company will redeem shares of voting and nonvoting\npreferred stock from Terminating Trust in an amount approximately equally to $fat.\n In connection with the proposed transaction, the following representations have\nbeen made:\n(a) \nThe amount to be paid in redemption of the Company stock will not\nexceed the sum of the federal and State B death taxes (including interest\ncollected as part of such taxes) imposed because of Decedent\u2019s death\nplus the amount of funeral and administration expenses allowed as\ndeductions to Estate under section 2053.  All death taxes and funeral and\nadministrative  expenses were paid by the trustees of Terminating Trust\nunder Article II of the Revocable Trust.\n(b) \nThe total of (i) the funeral and administrative expenses allowable as\nsection 2053 deductions plus (ii) the federal and State B death taxes\nimposed as a result of Decedent\u2019s death is $fat.\n(c)\nThe fair market value of Company\u2019s stock included in Decedent\u2019s gross\nestate for federal estate tax purposes exceeds 35 percent of the gross\nestate over the amounts allowable as deductions under sections 2053 and\n7\nPLR-104741-03\n2054.\n(d) \nThe interest of Terminating Trust in Company will be directly reduced by\nthe redemption used to pay the funeral expenses, administration\nexpenses, and death taxes.\n(e) \nIn the proposed redemption, Terminating Trust will receive cash which will\nbe approximately equal to the fair market value of the stock in Company\nsurrendered in exchange therefor.\n(f)\nCompany and Terminating Trust will each pay their own expenses\nincurred in the transaction.\n(g)\n No shareholder of Company is, or will be, obligated to purchase any of\nthe Company stock that will be redeemed.      \n(h) \nTerminating Trust will not transfer any property to Company other than\nstock in Company.   \n(i) \nThe proposed redemption will be the first redemption of any stock\nincluded in Estate.\n(j)\nThere is no plan to issue additional stock in Company and there are no\noutstanding warrants or options to purchase stock in Company, nor are\nthere any outstanding debentures or obligations that are convertible into\nstock in Company.  There is no plan or intention to issue any options,\nwarrants, debentures, or other obligations that may be convertible into\nCompany stock, or which would be considered to be Company stock.\n(k) \nThere are no declared but unpaid dividends, or funds set apart for\ndividends, on any Company stock.  \n \n(l) \nThe redemption will be completed prior to Date 5, so that it will occur in\nthe period subsequent to Decedent\u2019s death that is specified in section\n303(b)(1).\nSection 2057(a)(1) provides, generally, that for purposes of the tax imposed by \nsection 2001, in the case of an estate of a decedent to which this section applies, the\nvalue of the taxable estate shall be determined by deducting from the value of the gross\nestate the adjusted value of the qualified family-owned business interests (QFOBI) of\nthe decedent.  Section 2057(a)(2) provides that the deduction allowed by this section\nshall not exceed $675,000.\nSection 2057(f)(1) provides, generally, that there is imposed an additional estate\ntax if, within 10 years after the date of the decedent\u2019s death and before the date of the\nqualified heir\u2019s death: (A) the material participation requirements described in \n8\nPLR-104741-03\nsection 2032A(c)(6)(B) are not met with respect to the QFOBI which was acquired (or\npassed) from the decedent; (B) the qualified heir disposes of any portion of a QFOBI\n(other than by a disposition to a member of the qualified heir\u2019s family or through a\nqualified conservation contribution under section 170(h)); (C) the qualified heir loses\nUnited States citizenship (within the meaning of section 877) or with respect to whom\nan event described in section 877(e)(1)(A) or (B) occurs, and such heir does not comply\nwith the requirements of section 2057(g); or (D) the principal place of business of a\ntrade or business of the QFOBI ceases to be located in the United States. \nSection 2057(i)(3)(O) provides that for purposes of section 2057, rules similar to\nthe rules in section 6166(g)(1)(B), (C), and (D) (relating to acceleration of payment)\nshall apply.\nSection 6166(g)(1)(A) provides that if: (i) any portion of an interest in a closely\nheld business which qualifies under section 6166(a)(1) is distributed, sold, exchanged,\nor otherwise disposed of, or money and other property attributable to such an interest is\nwithdrawn from such trade or business, and (ii) the aggregate of such distributions,\nsales, exchanges, or other dispositions and withdrawals equals or exceeds 50 percent\nof the value of such interest, then the extension of time for payment of tax provided in\nsection 6166(a) shall cease to apply, and the unpaid portion of the tax payable in\ninstallments shall be paid upon notice and demand from the Secretary.\nSection 6166(g)(1)(B) provides that in the case of a distribution in redemption of\nstock to which section 303 (or so much of section 304 as relates to section 303) applies:\n(i) the redemption of such stock, and the withdrawal of money and other property\ndistributed in such redemption, shall not be treated as a distribution or withdrawal for\npurposes of section 6166(g)(1)(A), and (ii) for purposes of section 6166(g)(1)(A), the\nvalue of the interest in the closely held business shall be considered to be such value\nreduced by the value of the stock redeemed.  This paragraph shall apply only if, on or\nbefore the date prescribed by section 6166(a)(3) for the payment of the first installment\nwhich becomes due after the date of the distribution (or, if earlier, on or before the day\nwhich is 1 year after the date of the distribution), there is paid an amount of the tax\nimposed by section 2001 not less than the amount of money and other property\ndistributed.\nSection 6166(g)(1)(B) provides that in the case of a distribution in redemption of\nstock to which section 303 (or so much of section 304 as relates to section 303) applies,\nthe redemption of such stock, and the withdrawal of money and other property\ndistributed in such redemption shall not be treated as a distribution or withdrawal for\npurposes of determining whether the extension of time for payment of tax shall cease to\napply.  In applying rules similar to section 6166(g)(1)(B) to section 2057, a distribution in\nredemption of stock to which section 303 applies is not a disposition that would trigger\nadditional estate tax with respect to the QFOBI.  The reduction in the value of the\ninterest pursuant to section 6166(g)(1)(B)(ii) is applicable in determining whether\nsubsequent distributions, sales, exchanges, or other dispositions and withdrawals\nexceed 50 percent of the value of the interest under section 6166(g)(1)(A)(ii) and does\n9\nPLR-104741-03\nnot affect the determination of whether the estate is initially eligible for the extension of\ntime to pay under section 6166.  Similarly, in the context of QFOBI, the section 303\nredemption does not affect the initial determination of whether the estate is eligible to\nmake the QFOBI election.  Accordingly, a distribution in redemption of stock to which\nsection 303 applies shall not be treated as a disposition of any portion of a qualified\nfamily-owned business interest under section 2057(f)(1)(B).  Provided the proposed\nredemption satisfies the requirements of section 303, the proposed redemption will not\nresult in the imposition of an additional estate tax under section 2057(f)(1)(B). \nBased solely on the information submitted and the representations set forth\nabove, we hold as follows:\n(1)\nThe proposed distribution of cash by Company in redemption of a portion\nof the Company stock held by Terminating Trust, as described above,\nconstitutes a distribution in full payment in exchange for the Company\nstock redeemed as provided in section 303(a), to the extent that the\namount received does not exceed the sum specified in section 303(a) and\nprovided that the requirements set forth in section 303(b) are satisfied.\n(2)\nAs provided in section 1001, gain will be recognized by Terminating Trust\nmeasured by the difference between the redemption price and the\nadjusted basis of the stock surrendered as determined under section\n1011.  Provided section 341 (relating to collapsible corporations) is not\napplicable, and provided also that the stock is a capital asset in the hands\nof Terminating Trust, the gain, if any, will constitute capital gain subject to\nthe provisions and limitations of Subchapter P of Chapter 1..   \n(3)\nThe distribution in redemption of stock to which section 303 applies will\nnot be treated as a disposition of any portion of a qualified family-owned\nbusiness interest under section 2057(f)(1)(B).  Provided the proposed\nredemption satisfies the requirements of section 303, the proposed\nredemption will not result in the imposition of an additional estate tax\nunder section 2057(f)(1)(B).\nThe above rulings are effective to the extent that the amount distributed by\nCompany equals the fair market value of the stock redeemed.  No opinion is expressed\nas to the tax effect of the amount, if any, by which the distribution by Company exceeds\nor is less than the fair market value of the stock redeemed.  A determination of the fair\nmarket value of the stock redeemed is reserved until the income tax returns of the\ntaxpayers concerned have been filed for the year the transaction is consummated. \n.\nIn addition, no opinion is expressed about the tax treatment of the transaction\nunder other provisions of the Code and regulations or about the tax treatment of any\nconditions existing at the time of, or effect resulting from, the transaction that are not\nspecifically covered by the above rulings.\n10\nPLR-104741-03\nThis ruling is directed only to the taxpayer who requested it. Section 6110(k)(3)\nof the Code provides that it may not be used or cited as precedent.\nA copy of this letter should be attached to the federal income tax returns of the\ntaxpayer involved for the taxable year in which the transaction covered by this ruling\nletter is consummated.\nPursuant to a power of attorney on file in this office a copy of this letter is being\nsent to your authorized representative.\nSincerely yours,\n        By  Mark S.

While this office has not verified any of \nthe material submitted in support of the request for rulings, it is subject to verification on \nexamination. \n \nA, a long-term resident of the United States within the meaning of section 877(e), \nrelinquished his U.S. lawful permanent resident status (\"expatriated\") on Date D.  A has \nbeen a citizen of Country F during his entire life by reason of his birth on Date E in \nCountry F.  A became a permanent resident of the United States and obtained his green \ncard in Year G.  On the date of A\u2019s expatriation, his net worth exceeded the threshold \nrequired under section 877(a)(2). \n \n \nPLR-168481-03 \n \n2 \nSection 877 generally provides that a citizen who loses U.S. citizenship or a U.S. \nlong-term resident who ceases to be taxed as a lawful permanent resident (individuals \nwho \"expatriate\") within the 10-year period immediately preceding the close of the \ntaxable year will be taxed under section 877(b) and section 877(d) for such taxable \nyear, unless such loss did not have for one of its principal purposes the avoidance of \nU.S. taxes.  Sections 2107 and 2501(a)(3) provide special estate and gift tax regimes, \nrespectively, for individuals who expatriate with a principal purpose to avoid U.S. taxes. \n \nA former citizen or former long-term resident will be treated as having expatriated \nwith a principal purpose to avoid U.S. taxes for purposes of sections 877, 2107, and \n2501(a)(3) if the individual's average income tax liability or the individual's net worth on \nthe date of expatriation exceeds certain thresholds.  See sections 877(a)(2), \n2107(a)(2)(A), and 2501(a)(3)(B).  \n \nUnder Notice 98-34, 1998-2 C.B. 29, modifying Notice 97-19, 1997-1 C.B. 394, a \nformer U.S. citizen or former long-term resident whose net worth or average tax liability \nexceeds the applicable threshold will not be presumed to have a principal purpose of \ntax avoidance if that former citizen or former resident is described within certain \ncategories and submits a complete and good faith request for a ruling as to whether \nsuch loss had for one of its principal purposes the avoidance of U.S. taxes.  A is eligible \nto request a ruling pursuant to Notice 98-34 because on the date of expatriation, A was \na resident and fully liable to income tax in Country F, the country where A was born. \n \nNotice 98-34 requires that certain information be submitted with a request for a \nruling that an individual's expatriation did not have for one of its principal purposes the \navoidance of U.S. taxes.  A submitted all the information required by Notice 98-34, \nincluding any additional information requested by the Service after review of the \nsubmission. \n \n \nBased solely on the information submitted and the representations made, we \nconclude that A has made a complete and good faith submission in accordance with \nsection 877(c)(1)(B) and Notice 98-34.  Therefore, A will not be presumed under section \n877(a)(2) to have as one of his principal purposes for expatriating the avoidance of U.S. \ntaxes. \n \nHowever, because the information submitted does not clearly establish either the \nexistence or lack of a principal purpose to avoid taxes under subtitle A or B of the Code, \nno opinion is expressed as to whether A's expatriation had for one of its principal \npurposes the avoidance of such taxes.  While this ruling rebuts the presumption of tax \navoidance under section 877(a)(2), it is not conclusive as to whether A subsequently \nmay be found to have a principal purpose of tax avoidance under sections 877(a)(1), \n2107(a)(1), and 2501(a)(3)(A) based on all the facts and circumstances.  See section \n877(c)(1). \n \n \nPLR-168481-03 \n \n3 \nExcept as expressly provided herein, no opinion is expressed or implied \nconcerning the tax consequences of any aspect of any transaction or item discussed or \nreferenced in this letter.  In addition, no opinion is expressed as to A's U.S. tax liability \nfor taxable periods prior to his loss of permanent resident status or for taxable periods \nafter his loss of permanent resident status under sections of the Code other than \nsections 877, 2107, and 2501(a)(3). \n \nThis ruling is directed only to the taxpayer requesting it.  Section 6110(k)(3) of \nthe Code provides that it may not be used or cited as precedent. \n \nIn accordance with the power of attorney on file with this office, a copy of this \nletter is being sent to A\u2019s representative. \n \nSincerely, \n \n \n \nM.

Grandchild is the beneficiary of Trust, a trust created under \nArticle 10C of Settlor\u2019s last will.  Paragraph 1 of Article 10C provides that during \nGrandchild\u2019s life, the trustees of Trust are to make discretionary payments of the net \nincome and principal to or for the benefit of Grandchild and Grandchild\u2019s issue.  \nParagraph 2 of Article 10C provides that upon the death of Grandchild, the trustees of \nTrust are to pay over the principal, as then constituted, and any accumulated or \nundistributed income, \u201cto such among [Settlor\u2019s] issue\u201d as Grandchild shall validly \nappoint in Grandchild\u2019s last will.  Any balance of Trust remaining and not effectively \nappointed by Grandchild in Grandchild\u2019s last will is disposed of pursuant to \nparagraphs 2 and 3 of Article 10C of Settlor\u2019s last will.\nPLR-104178-14\n2\nRulings Requested\nGrandchild has requested the following rulings:\n1. The testamentary power of appointment granted to Grandchild in Trust does not \nconstitute a general power of appointment within the meaning of \u00a7 2041(b)(1); \nand\n2. The existence, exercise, failure to fully exercise, or partial or complete release of \nGrandchild\u2019s power to appoint the principal and any accumulated or undistributed \nincome of Trust will not cause the value of the property in Trust to be included in \nGrandchild\u2019s gross estate under \u00a7 2041(a).\nLaw and Analysis\nSection 2041(a)(2) provides that the value of the gross estate includes the value of all \nproperty with respect to which the decedent has at the time of his death a general \npower of appointment created after October 21, 1942, or with respect to which the \ndecedent has at any time exercised or released such a power of appointment by a \ndisposition which is of such nature that if it were a transfer of property owned by the \ndecedent, the property would be includible in the decedent\u2019s gross estate under \n\u00a7\u00a7 2035 to 2038, inclusive.  For purposes of \u00a7 2041(a)(2), the power of appointment is \nconsidered to exist on the date of the decedent\u2019s death even though the exercise of the \npower is subject to a precedent giving of notice or even though the exercise of the \npower takes effect only on the expiration of a stated period after its exercise, whether or \nnot on or before the date of the decedent\u2019s death notice has been given or the power \nhas been exercised. \nSection 2041(b)(1) provides, with exceptions not relevant here, that the term \u201cgeneral \npower of appointment\u201d means a power that is exercisable in favor of the decedent, his \nestate, his creditors, or the creditors of his estate.\nSection 20.2041-1(c)(1) of the Estate Tax Regulations provides that the term \u201cgeneral \npower of appointment\u201d as defined in \u00a7 2041(b)(1) means any power of appointment \nexercisable in favor of the decedent, his estate, his creditors, or the creditors of his \nestate.  Section 20.2041-1(c)(1)(a) provides that a power of appointment is not a \ngeneral power if by its terms it is exercisable only in favor of one or more designated \npersons or classes other than the decedent or his creditors, or the decedent\u2019s estate or \nthe creditors of his estate.\nIn this case, Grandchild may appoint by will the principal and accumulated or \nundistributed income of Trust to the class consisting of Settlor\u2019s issue.  Because \nGrandchild\u2019s power of appointment is a testamentary power, Grandchild may not \nappoint any part of Trust to Grandchild or to Grandchild\u2019s creditors during Grandchild\u2019s \nlife.  In addition, based on the terms of Trust, the reference to \u201csuch among [Settlor\u2019s] \nPLR-104178-14\n3\nissue\u201d as a permissible class of appointees of Grandchild\u2019s testamentary power is \nproperly viewed as not including Grandchild\u2019s estate or the creditors of Grandchild\u2019s \nestate after Grandchild\u2019s death.\nAccordingly, based on the information submitted and the representations made, we \nconclude that: (1) Grandchild\u2019s testamentary power of appointment over the principal \nand accumulated or undistributed income of Trust does not constitute a general power \nof appointment within the meaning of \u00a7 2041(b)(1) and (2) the existence, exercise, \nfailure to fully exercise, or partial or complete release of Grandchild\u2019s power to appoint \nthe principal and accumulated or undistributed income of Trust will not cause the value \nof the property in Trust to be included in Grandchild\u2019s gross estate under \u00a7 2041(a).\nExcept as expressly provided herein, no opinion is expressed or implied concerning the \ntax consequences of any aspect of any transaction or item discussed or referenced in \nthis letter.\nThis ruling is directed only to the taxpayer requesting it.

Taxpayers request an extension of \ntime under sections 301.9100-1 and 301.9100-3 of the Procedure and Administration \nRegulations (the \u201cRegulations\u201d) to make an election under section 856(l) of the Internal \nRevenue Code (the \u201cCode\u201d) to treat Company as a taxable REIT subsidiary (\u201cTRS\u201d) of \nTaxpayer effective as of Date 8.\nFACTS\nTaxpayer is a State corporation and represents that it made an election to be \ntreated as a real estate investment trust (\u201cREIT\u201d) under sections 856 through 859 of the \nCode commencing with its taxable year that ended on Date 1.  Taxpayer uses the \naccrual method as its overall method of accounting, and Taxpayer\u2019s taxable year is the \ncalendar year.  Taxpayer owns multiple real estate properties located not only in the \nUnited States, but also in certain foreign countries.\nCompany is a private limited company that was formed under the laws of Country \nX on Date 2.  Company is wholly owned by Taxpayer.  Taxpayer, through Company, \nestablished several property companies in Country X (the \u201cProperty Companies\") in \nconnection with the acquisition of a real estate portfolio in Country X.  The Property \nCompanies have been funded by Taxpayer with a combination of debt (directly and \nindirectly by Taxpayer) and equity (indirectly through Company).\nCompany and the Property Companies are Country X tax entities and tax \nresidents and have filed Country X corporate tax returns since their inceptions.  \nTaxpayers represent that at all times from the dates of their organization and for all \ntaxable years prior to Date 3, Company and the Property Companies have been treated \nas disregarded entities for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and no inconsistent tax or \ninformation returns have been filed during any of the taxable years prior to Date 3.  \nTaxpayers represent that the loans made by Taxpayer to the Property \nCompanies were disregarded for U.S. federal income tax purposes until Date 4.  \nPLR-127123-17\n3\nHowever, for Country X tax purposes, the Property Companies have been claiming a \ntax deduction for the arm\u2019s length interest payments to Taxpayer.\nCountry X introduced certain new tax provisions (the \u201cTax Rules\u201d) that became \neffective on Date 3.  Under the Tax Rules, a tax deduction is disallowed for certain \ninterest payments made by a hybrid payer in cases where an investor in the payer does \nnot include the corresponding interest payments in income.  This deduction \ndisallowance affects the overall economics of the financial arrangement between \nCompany and Taxpayer.\nTaxpayer engaged Firm to assess the effects of the Tax Rules on the \ndeductibility of interest payments made by the Property Companies for Country X tax \npurposes.   Based on the analysis it performed, Firm concluded that it was more likely \nthan not that the Tax Rules would not apply to the inter-company loan arrangement \nbetween Taxpayer and the Property Companies.  Accordingly, under Firm\u2019s conclusion, \nCountry X deductibility would be retained even after the effective date of the Tax Rules, \nand the current relationship and classifications of Company for U.S. tax purposes did \nnot need to change.  Relying on Firm's conclusion, the Property Companies decided to \nmaintain the prior structure, but request a ruling from Agency (Country X\u2019s tax and \nrevenue authority) seeking confirmation that the Tax Rules do not disallow a tax \ndeduction for the arm\u2019s length interest payments made by the Property Companies to \nTaxpayer.  On Date 5, a request for such a ruling was filed with Agency.\nAt the time the ruling request was filed, Taxpayer only had a short period of time, \nby Date 6, to timely file a Form 8832 (Entity Classification Election), and a Form 8875 \n(Taxable REIT Subsidiary Election), to treat the Company as a corporation and as a \nTRS for U.S. federal income tax purposes as of Date 3.  Taxpayers represent that if the \nelections had been recommended by Firm and timely made, the elections would have \nresulted in the Tax Rules not applying to Taxpayer and the Property Companies.  \nHowever, Taxpayers followed the advice of Firm, and believed that the Tax Rules did \nnot apply, and thus determined that such elections were not necessary to avoid the \napplication of the Tax Rules.  Accordingly, Taxpayers did not make an election to treat \nCompany as a TRS of Taxpayer as of Date 3.\nOn Date 7, Agency responded and reached an adverse determination on the \nruling request, causing the Property Companies to lose the Country X tax deductions for \nits interest payments under the then current arrangement.  Taxpayers represent that if \nTaxpayers had known, or had a reasonable expectation of knowing, how that Agency \nwould apply the Tax Rules to the Taxpayers\u2019 situation, Taxpayers would have elected to \ntreat Company as a TRS of Taxpayer as of Date 8.  Rather, Taxpayers relied on Firm\u2019s \nconclusion of how the Tax Rules would apply to the Taxpayers\u2019 case.\nPLR-127123-17\n4\nSubsequent to Agency\u2019s issuance of the adverse determination on the ruling \nrequest, and after further consultation with Firm, Taxpayer and Company decided to file \na Form 8832 and a Form 8875.  On Date 9, the Taxpayers filed a Form 8832, pursuant \nto the late classification relief provided for in Rev. Proc. 2009-41, 2009-39 I.R.B. 439, for \nCompany to elect to be classified as an association taxable as a corporation, effective \nDate 8.  Additionally on Date 9, Taxpayer and Company filed a Form 8875 that listed \nthe earliest possible effective date permitted under Form 8875, which was Date 10, \nalthough the Taxpayers desired an earlier effective date, Date 8.\nTaxpayer and Company make the following additional representations in \nconnection with their request for an extension of time:\n1.  The request for relief was filed before the failure to make the regulatory \nelection was discovered by the Service.\n2.  Granting the relief requested will not result in Taxpayer or Company having a \nlower U.S. federal tax liability in the aggregate for all years to which the election applies \nthan they would have had if the election had been timely made (taking into account the \ntime value of money).\n3.  Taxpayer and Company do not seek to alter a return position for which an \naccuracy-related penalty has been or could have been imposed under section 6662 of \nthe Code at the time they requested relief and the new position requires or permits a \nregulatory election for which relief is requested.\n4.  Being fully informed of the required regulatory election and related tax \nconsequences, Taxpayer and Company did not choose to not file the election.\n5.  Taxpayer and Company are not using hindsight in making the decision to \nseek the relief requested.  No specific facts have changed since the due date for \nmaking the election that make the election advantageous to Taxpayer or Company.\n6.  The period of limitations on assessment under section 6501(a) has not \nexpired for Taxpayer or Company for the taxable year in which the election should have \nbeen filed, nor for any taxable year(s) that would have been affected by the election had \nit been timely filed.\nIn addition, affidavits on behalf of Taxpayer and Company have been provided as\nrequired by section 301.9100-3(e) of the Regulations.\nLAW AND ANALYSIS\nPLR-127123-17\n5\nSection 856(l) of the Code provides that a REIT and a corporation (other than a \nREIT) may jointly elect to treat such corporation as a TRS.  To be eligible for treatment \nas a TRS, section 856(l)(1) provides that the REIT must directly or indirectly own stock \nin the corporation, and the REIT and the corporation must jointly elect such treatment.  \nThe election is irrevocable once made, unless both the REIT and the subsidiary consent \nto its revocation.  In addition, section 856(l) specifically provides that the election, and \nany revocation thereof, may be made without the consent of the Secretary.\nIn Announcement 2001-17, 2001-1 C.B. 716, the Service announced the \navailability of new Form 8875, Taxable REIT Subsidiary Election.  According to the \nAnnouncement, this form is to be used for taxable years beginning after 2000 for eligible \nentities to elect treatment as a TRS.  The instructions to Form 8875 provide that the \nsubsidiary and the REIT can make the election at any time during the taxable year.  \nHowever, the effective date of the election depends on when the Form 8875 is filed.  \nThe instructions further provide that the effective date cannot be more than 2 months \nand 15 days prior to the date of filing the election, or more than 12 months after the date \nof filing the election.  If no date is specified on the form, the election is effective on the \ndate the form is filed with the Service.\nSection 301.9100-1(c) of the Regulations provides that the Commissioner has \ndiscretion to grant a reasonable extension of time to make a regulatory election, or a \nstatutory election (but no more than 6 months except in the case of a taxpayer who is \nabroad), under all subtitles of the Code except subtitles E, G, H, and I.  Section \n301.9100-1(b) defines a regulatory election as an election whose due date is prescribed \nby regulations or by a revenue ruling, a revenue procedure, a notice, or an \nannouncement published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin.\nSection 301.9100-3(a) through (c)(1) sets forth rules that the Service generally \nwill use to determine whether, under the particular facts and circumstances of each \nsituation, the Commissioner will grant an extension of time for regulatory elections that \ndo not meet the requirements of section 301.9100-2.  Section 301.9100-3(a) provides \nthat requests for relief subject to this section will be granted when the taxpayer provides \nthe evidence (including affidavits described in section 301.9100-3(e)) to establish to the \nsatisfaction of the Commissioner that the taxpayer acted reasonably and in good faith, \nand the grant of relief will not prejudice the interests of the Government.\nSection 301.9100-3(b) provides that a taxpayer is deemed to have acted \nreasonably and in good faith if the taxpayer (i) requests relief under this section before \nthe failure to make the regulatory election is discovered by the Service; (ii) failed to \nmake the election because of intervening events beyond the taxpayer\u2019s control; (iii) \nfailed to make the election because, after exercising reasonable diligence (taking into \naccount the taxpayer\u2019s experience and the complexity of the return or issue), the \ntaxpayer was unaware of the necessity for the election; (iv) reasonably relied on the \nPLR-127123-17\n6\nwritten advice of the Service; or (v) reasonably relied on a qualified tax professional, \nincluding a tax professional employed by the taxpayer, and the tax professional failed to \nmake, or advise the taxpayer to make, the election.  A taxpayer will be deemed to have \nnot acted reasonably and in good faith if the taxpayer (i) seeks to alter a return position \nfor which an accuracy-related penalty has been or could be imposed under section \n6662 at the time the taxpayer requests relief and the new position requires or permits a \nregulatory election for which relief is requested; (ii) was informed in all material respects \nof the required election and related tax consequences, but chose not to file the election; \nor (iii) uses hindsight in requesting relief.\nSection 301.9100-3(c)(1) provides that a reasonable extension of time to make a \nregulatory election will be granted only when the interests of the Government will not be \nprejudiced by the granting of relief.  Section 301.9100-3(c)(1)(i) provides that the \ninterests of the Government are prejudiced if granting relief would result in the taxpayer \nhaving a lower tax liability in the aggregate for all taxable years affected by the election \nthan the taxpayer would have had if the election had been timely made (taking into \naccount the time value of money).  Section 301.9100-3(c)(1)(ii) provides that the \ninterests of the Government are ordinarily prejudiced if the taxable year in which the \nregulatory election should have been made or any taxable years that would have been \naffected by the election had it been timely made are closed by the period of limitations \non assessment under section 6501(a) before the taxpayer\u2019s receipt of a ruling granting \nrelief under this section.\nCONCLUSION\nBased on the information submitted and the representations made, we conclude \nthat Taxpayers have satisfied the requirements for granting a reasonable extension of \ntime to elect under section 856(l) to treat Company as a TRS of Taxpayer, effective \nDate 8.  Accordingly, Taxpayers have 90 calendar days from the date of this letter to \nmake the intended election to treat Company as a TRS of Taxpayer, effective Date 8.\nThis ruling is limited to the timeliness of the filing of Form 8875.  This ruling\u2019s \napplication is limited to the facts, representations, and Code and regulation sections \ncited herein. \nExcept as provided herein, no opinion is expressed or implied concerning the tax \nconsequences of any aspect of any transaction or item discussed or referenced in this \nletter.  In particular, no opinion is expressed as to whether Taxpayer qualifies as a \nREIT, or whether Company otherwise qualifies as a TRS of Taxpayer under part II of \nsubchapter M of the Code. \nNo opinion is expressed with regard to whether the tax liability of Taxpayer or \nCompany is not lower in the aggregate for all years to which the election applies than \nPLR-127123-17\n7\nsuch tax liability would have been if the election had been timely made (taking into \naccount the time value of money).  Upon audit of the U.S. federal income tax returns \ninvolved, the director\u2019s office will determine such tax liability for the years involved.  If \nthe director\u2019s office determines that such tax liability is lower, that office will determine \nthe U.S. federal income tax effect.\nThe ruling contained in this letter is based upon information and representations \nsubmitted by Taxpayer and Company and accompanied by penalty of perjury \nstatements executed by the appropriate parties.

In support of its request, the Issuer set forth the facts and \nrepresentations described below.  \nFACTS AND REPRESENTATIONS\nPLR-126285-08\n2\nThe Issuer is an electrical district established by the governing body of County pursuant \nto State law and is a political subdivision of State.  \nThe Tribe is recognized as an Indian tribal government in Rev. Proc. 2002-64, 2002-2 \nC.B. 717, which lists Indian tribal governments that are to be treated similarly to states \nfor specified purposes under the Code. The Borrower is a political subdivision of the \nTribe, recognized as such by the Internal Revenue Service in Rev. Proc. 84-36, 1984-1 \nC.B. 510.  The Borrower was established in Year 1 to provide utility service to the \npopulation of the Tribe, including electrical service, on the Tribe\u2019s reservation (the \n\u201cReservation\u201d).  Tribal law authorizes the Borrower to furnish utility, generation, \ntelecommunications and information services, on a nonprofit basis and at reasonable \ncosts, to all areas of the Reservation, where such services are determined to be \nfeasible and economical, in order to improve the health and welfare of the Tribal \nmembers.\nThe Borrower is governed by a board (the \u201cBoard\u201d) having a members each of which is \nappointed by a committee of the Tribal council.  The Borrower\u2019s officers are selected by, \nand responsible to, the Board.  The Board, after a public hearing, sets the rates for the \nelectrical service on a non-profit basis.  For this purpose, the Board understands this to \nmean that rates must be adequate to assure the continued financial integrity and self-\nsufficiency of the Borrower, rather than generating a financial return to the Tribe.  The \nBorrower has intermittently generated some net surpluses which have been used to \nfund necessary reserves, pay for capital improvements, and subsidize other utility \noperations, such as water and sewage services, by the Borrower.  To date, the \nBorrower has not distributed any surpluses to the Tribe.  \nThe Project is a gas-fired, combustion turbine electric generating facility and related \nsupport facilities located in County, State.  The Issuer intends to issue bonds (the \n\u201cBonds\u201d) to finance a portion of the costs of the Project.  The Borrower will enter into a \nset of long-term agreements (collectively referred to as the \u201cContract\u201d) with the Issuer \nunder which the Borrower will acquire an undivided ownership interest in the Project \nand will pay its pro-rata share of the principal and interest on the Bonds for as long as \nthey are outstanding.  Borrower will file a Form 8038 with respect to the Contract.  The \nProject is expected to be placed in service in Year 2.\nCurrently, the Borrower provides electric service to most of the Reservation.  Other \npower providers generally may serve customers located on the Reservation only with \npermission of the Borrower in areas not served by the Borrower or in certain limited \ncircumstances generally not subject to expansion.  The Borrower owns no generation \nresources and must acquire at wholesale all of the power to serve its customers.  The \nBorrower provides a small amount of service to residential, public entity, and \ncommercial customers immediately outside the Reservation where there is no \ncomparable electric service available.  \nPLR-126285-08\n3\nApproximately one third of the Borrower\u2019s electric power sales are to industrial \ncustomers, with the remainder a mix of residential, governmental, and commercial \nusers.  With some exceptions, the Borrower provides service to all its customers at \nstandard rates and tariffs, including year-long supply contracts with large users.  \nTo the extent that the Borrower expects to provide power from the Project to any user in \na manner that causes private business use of the Project, any such private business \nuse of the Project in excess of that permissible under \u00a7 141 will be financed with funding \nsources other than proceeds of the Bonds.\nThe Issuer presented evidence that in 2005 there were numerous governmentally \nowned electrical utilities (\u201cmunicipal power utilities\u201d) serving 14% of residential \ncustomers in the United States and providing 15% of all power sold to ultimate \nconsumers in the country.  Approximately one third of the municipal power utilities will \nbe 100 years old by 2010.  The total original principal amount of currently outstanding \nbonds used to finance municipal power projects is approximately $303 billion.\nThe Borrower fits within a group of 152 municipal power utilities with more than 20,000 \ncustomers.  Forty-four percent of municipal power utilities in the Borrower\u2019s class \n(20,000 to 50,000 customers) have appointed governing bodies and 91% of such \nutilities in the Borrower\u2019s class serve some customers outside of their jurisdictional \nboundaries.\nLAW AND ANALYSIS\nSection 7871 sets forth the various purposes for which an Indian tribal government may \nbe treated as a state. The term Indian tribal government is defined under \u00a7 7701(a)(4) of \nthe Code to mean the governing body of any tribe, band, community, village or group of \nIndians, or (if applicable) Alaska Natives that is determined by the Secretary of the \nTreasury, after consultation with the Secretary of the Interior, to exercise governmental \nfunctions. The Secretary of the Treasury's determination is set forth in Rev. Proc. 2002-\n64, which contains a modified and supplemented list of Indian tribal governments that \nare to be treated similarly to states for specified purposes under the Code.\nSection 7871(a)(4) provides that, subject to \u00a7 7871(c), an Indian tribal government shall \nbe treated as a state for purposes of \u00a7 103 (relating to state and local bonds). Section \n7871(c)(1) states that \u00a7 103(a) shall apply to an obligation (not described in \n\u00a7 7871(c)(2)) issued by an Indian tribal government (or a subdivision thereof) only if the \nobligation is part of an issue substantially all of the proceeds of which are used in the \nexercise of any essential governmental function.  Section 7871(e) provides that an \nessential governmental function does not include any function that is not customarily \nperformed by state and local governments with general taxing powers.\nPLR-126285-08\n4\nSection 7871(d) provides that for purposes of \u00a7 7871(a), a subdivision of an Indian tribal \ngovernment shall be treated as a political subdivision of a state if (and only if) the \nsecretary of the Treasury determines (after consultation with the secretary of the \nInterior) that such subdivision has been delegated the right to exercise one or more of \nthe substantial governmental functions of the Indian tribal government.  The Secretary \nof the Treasury's determination is set forth in Rev. Proc. 84-36, which contains a list of \nsubdivisions of Indian tribal governments that are to be treated as political subdivisions \nof states for specified purposes under the Code.\nUnder \u00a7 7871(a)(4) and \u00a7 7871(c), an Indian tribal government may be treated as a \nState or political subdivision of a State for purposes of \u00a7 103(a) with respect to proceeds \nof an obligation issued by the tribal government if the proceeds of the obligation are \nused in the exercise of an essential governmental function within the meaning of \n\u00a7 7871(e). In the instant case, the Contract, entered into by the Borrower, will constitute \nan obligation for Federal tax purposes.  Thus, if the proceeds of the Contract (i.e., the \nundivided interest in the Project to be owned by the Borrower) are used in the exercise \nof an essential governmental function, Borrower will be treated as a political subdivision \nof a state for purposes of \u00a7 103.  Whether the ownership and use by the Borrower of its \ninterest in the Project is an essential governmental function depends, in part, on \nwhether such activity is customarily performed by state and local governments with \ngeneral taxing powers.\nSection 7871(c)(1) does not define the term essential governmental function, however, \n\u00a7 7871(e) limits the term to functions that are customarily performed by state or local \ngovernments with general taxing powers. In the absence of a definition, we turn to the \nlegislative history of \u00a7 7871 to determine the intent of Congress with respect to tax-\nexempt financing by Indian tribal governments.\nThe essential governmental function limitation has been in place since the original \nenactment of \u00a7 7871 by The Indian Tribal Government Tax Status Act, Pub. L. No. 97-\n473, \u00a7 202 (1983) (the \u201c1982 Act\u201d). The Report of the Senate Finance Committee, \nexplains:\nThe bill provides that Indian tribal governments are to be treated \ngenerally the same as states (and tribal subdivisions are to be treated \ngenerally the same as political subdivisions of states) for purposes of the \ntax-exempt bond interest provisions. However, the bill includes a number \nof restrictions on this treatment of Indian tribal governments with respect \nto commercial or industrial activities or other activities other than essential \ngovernmental functions. The purpose of those restrictions is generally \neither (1) to allow the profits from such activities to be exempt from federal \nincome tax (because of the basic federal income tax exemption of Indian \ntribes and because Section 115 does not apply to Indian tribes) or (2) to \nallow the interest on the obligations where the proceeds are used in such \nPLR-126285-08\n5\ncommercial or industrial activities to be exempt from federal income tax, \nbut not to allow both of these benefits to apply in any one case.\n. . .\nIf all or a major portion of the proceeds of an Indian tribal \ngovernment obligations are to be used, directly, or indirectly, in one or \nmore commercial or industrial activities (or other activities other than \nessential governmental functions) conducted by the tribe then the interest \non the obligation is not to be exempt from federal income tax.\nS. Rep. No. 97-646, at 13-14 (1982).\nThe Senate Finance Committee report continues:\nThe bill permits one exception to this rule - where an Indian tribal \ngovernment (or a subdivision of that government) issues an obligation the \nproceeds of which are to be used in a utility-type activity.  The bill provides \nthat this exception applies only if the activity provides substantially all of its \nservice on that tribe's reservation.\nA utility-type activity includes the furnishing or sale of electrical \nenergy, gas, water, or sewage disposal services.  It does not include air or \nwater pollution control facilities unless they are a part of the normal \noperation of what would otherwise be a utility-type activity.\nId. at 14.\nThe Conference Committee followed the Senate amendment, with some modifications.  \nThe exception that would have allowed tribes to issue tax-exempt bonds for utility-type \nactivities on the reservation disappeared as an exception.  The Committee, however, \nspecifically recognized sewers, a utility-type activity, as an example of an essential \ngovernmental function along with schools and streets.   The Conference Report \naccompanying the 1982 Act states:\nThe conference agreement follows the Senate amendment, with \nmodifications and clarifications.  First, Indian tribal governments are \npermitted only to issue public activity bonds, the proceeds of which are \nused in an essential governmental function (such as schools, streets, and \nsewers).  Therefore, tribal governments are not permitted to issue private \nactivity bonds (i.e., industrial development bonds, scholarship bonds, and \nmortgage subsidy bonds).  \nH.R. Rep. 97-984 at 16-17 (1982) (Conf. Rep.).  \nPLR-126285-08\n6\nWe do not believe the exclusion of the specific exception for utility-type activity \nfrom the Conference Committee\u2019s report reflects an intent by Congress that \nutility-type activities may not be financed with tax-exempt bonds.  We believe, \ninstead, that the Conference Committee\u2019s specific inclusion of sewers as an \nexample of an essential governmental function was indicative of its intent that \nengaging in utility-type activities, under appropriate circumstances, may \nconstitute an essential governmental function.\nIn October of 1987, the House of Representatives, added \u00a7 7871(e) as part of The \nOmnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987, Pub. L. No. 100-203, 101 Stat. 1330, \n\u00a7 10632(a) (1987) (the \u201c1987 Act\u201d). The House Report explains this provision as follows:\nThe bill clarifies that, with respect to bonds issued by Indian tribal \ngovernments, the term essential governmental function does not include \nany governmental function that is not customarily performed (and financed \nwith governmental tax-exempt bonds) by States and local governments \nwith general taxing powers. For example, the issuance of bonds to finance \ncommercial or industrial facilities (e.g., private rental housing, cement \nfactories, or mirror factories) which bonds technically may not be private \nactivity bonds is not included within the scope of the essential \ngovernmental exception.\nAdditionally, the committee wishes to stress that only those \nactivities that are customarily financed with governmental bonds (e.g., \nschools, roads, governmental buildings, etc.) are intended to be within the \nscope of this exception, notwithstanding that isolated instances of a State \nor local government issuing bonds for another activity may occur. Further, \nthe fact that the Bureau of Indian Affairs may provide Federal assistance \nfor Indian tribal governments to engage in commercial and industrial \nventures as tribal government activities is not intended to be determinative \nfor purposes of the Internal Revenue Code. (Any existing Treasury \nDepartment regulations that may infer a contrary result are to be treated \nas invalid.)\nH.R. Rep. No. 100-391, at 1139 (1987).\nThe Conference Report to the 1987 Act provides:\nThe Conference agreement follows the House bill with a \nmodification permitting Indian tribal governments to issue as tax-exempt \nprivate activity bonds certain bonds for tribal manufacturing facilities as an \nexception to the general rule that tribal governments may issue tax-\nexempt bonds only for essential governmental functions which States and \nPLR-126285-08\n7\nlocal governments customarily perform. The conferees adopted this \nlimited exception in recognition of the unique responsibilities of Indian \ntribal governments in managing historical tribal resources and land held in \ntrust by the Federal Government and limited its scope to bonds designed \nto foster employment opportunities on these tribal lands as part of the \nperformance of this unique responsibility.\nH.R. Rep. No. 100-495, at 1012 (1987) (Conf. Rep.) (footnote omitted).\nUnder the specific language of \u00a7 7871(e), an activity must be customarily performed by \nState and local governments to be eligible to be an essential governmental function.  \nThe term customary has been defined as \"agreeing with custom; established by custom; \ncommonly practiced, used, or observed; familiar through long use or acquaintance.\"1 In \napplying this definition to \u00a7 7871(e), we look both to the prevalence of such activity \namong state and local governments as well as the history of state and local \ngovernments performing the specific activity.  This approach is consistent with the \nlegislative history of \u00a7 7871(e), which says that to find that something is customarily \nperformed requires more than \"isolated instances\" of comparable activity.  \nFinally, the 1987 House Report and the 1987 Conference Report indicate that Congress \nviewed activities customarily conducted by state and local governments as including \npublic works style projects and excluding commercial and industrial activities such as \nmanufacturing facilities.  Congress further reflected this understanding by creating a \nspecial exception to the private activity bond rules for certain tribally owned \nmanufacturing facilities.  \nThus, based upon the language of the statute, the legislative history of \u00a7 7871(a)(4) in \ngeneral and \u00a7 7871(e) in particular, we conclude that an activity is to be considered an \nessential governmental function customarily performed by state and local governments \nonly if: (1) there are numerous state and local governments with general taxing powers \nthat have been conducting the activity and financing it with tax-exempt governmental \nbonds, (2) state and local governments with general taxing powers have been \nconducting the activity and financing it with tax-exempt governmental bonds for many\nyears, and (3) the activity is not a commercial or industrial activity.  For purposes of \napplying this analysis where the activity is the ownership and operation of a facility, only \ncomparable facilities owned and operated by states and local governments may be \ntaken into account.\nBased on the above information, we find that the ownership, operation, and financing \nwith proceeds of tax-exempt bonds of the facilities of municipal power utilities to be both \nsufficiently prevalent and sufficiently longstanding among state and local governments \nto be considered customarily performed by state and local governments.  The \n  \n1 Webster\u2019s Third New Int\u2019l Dictionary 559 (1986).\nPLR-126285-08\n8\nBorrower\u2019s electrical utility system, including its proposed interest in Project, is \ncomparable to the generation, transmission, and distribution systems of these prevalent \nand longstanding municipal power utilities.  Accordingly, we find that the Project is \ncomparable to schools, roads, and sewers customarily owned and operated by state \nand local governments.\nOnce we conclude that the ownership and operation of Borrower\u2019s interest in the Project \nis an exercise of a governmental function that has been performed for many years by \nnumerous state and local governments, we need to also determine whether ownership \nand operation of that interest is a commercial or industrial activity.  The legislative \nhistory to \u00a7 7871 does not define the criteria for identifying a commercial or industrial \nfacility but it does state that \"commercial or industrial facilities (e.g., private rental \nhousing, cement factories, or mirror factories) . . . [are] not included within the scope of \nthe essential governmental function exception.\"  H.R. Rep. No. 100-391, at 1139 (1987).  \nThe legislative history of \u00a7 7871 indicates Congress was making a distinction between a \nbroader public interest and an interest in profit when it distinguished an essential \ngovernmental function from a commercial or industrial activity.  Similarly, the purposes \nof an organization exempt under \u00a7 501(c)(3), which must serve a broad public interest, \ncannot include commercial purposes that serve the private interest of those who profit.  \nAs courts have done for purposes of determining the commercial nature of an entity \nunder \u00a7 501, we look to all the facts and circumstances to determine whether the \nownership and operation of Borrower\u2019s interest in the Project is commercial or industrial \nin nature for purposes of \u00a7 7871(c) and (e).  Relevant factors include, but are not limited \nto whether the Borrower operates that interest (a) to earn a profit for the Tribe, (b) in \ncompetition with for-profit entities, and (c) in a commercial manner.  We also look at the \nbalance of the operations of the Borrower with respect to its interest in the Project \nbetween service to the local community and to paying customers outside of the local \ncommunity.\nAlthough Borrower provides services similar to those of investor-owned electrical \nutilities, unlike those businesses, Tribal law requires that Borrower as an entity operate \non a non-profit basis.  Hence, the rates set for the delivery of electrical service, including \nthose derived from its interest in Project, are to be set high enough for self-sufficiency, \nbut not to earn a profit for the Tribe.  Consistent thereto, surpluses, when generated, are \nnot paid to the Tribe, but are used by the Borrower to fund necessary reserves, make \ncapital improvements and subsidize other utility services within the Borrower\u2019s service \narea.  With very limited exceptions, Borrower, in an uncompetitive environment, delivers \nelectrical power only to residential, commercial, and industrial customers within the \nReservation.  The presence of these factors indicates that Borrower\u2019s ownership and \noperation of the Project is not a commercial activity, and is indistinguishable from public \nworks projects such as roads, schools, sewers, or governmental buildings which lack a \nPLR-126285-08\n9\nprofit-making objective, focus on public benefits to local citizens, and are not in \ncompetition with other businesses.  \nWith respect to the balance of the operations of the facility between service to the local \ncommunity and to paying customers outside of the local community, the electrical power \ngenerated by Borrower\u2019s interest in the Project will be used to service the local \npopulation with only minimal amount of power sold to customers in the immediate \nvicinity of the Reservation that are not adequately served by other power providers.  \nCONCLUSION\nAccordingly, we conclude that the ownership and operation of the Borrower\u2019s interest in \nProject will be an exercise of an essential governmental function customarily performed \nby state and local governments within the meaning of \u00a7 7871(c) & (e).  Consequently, \nBorrower will be treated as a political subdivision of a state for purposes of applying \n\u00a7\u00a7 103 and 141 to the Bonds.  \nExcept as expressly provided herein, no opinion is expressed or implied concerning the \ntax consequences of any aspect of any transaction or item discussed or referenced in \nthis letter, including whether the Bonds are tax-exempt under \u00a7 103 of the Code.\nThis ruling is directed only to the taxpayer requesting it.  Section 6110(k)(3) of the Code \nprovides that it may not be used or cited as precedent.\nTemporary or final regulations pertaining to one or more of the issues addressed in this \nruling have not yet been adopted.  Therefore, this ruling will be modified or revoked by \nthe adoption of temporary or final regulations to the extent the regulations are \ninconsistent with any conclusion in the letter ruling.

The material information submitted in that \nrequest and in a supplemental letter dated October 9, 2009 is summarized below.\nPLR-139967-09\n3\nFACTS\nParent is a publicly traded corporation and is the common parent of an affiliated \ngroup of corporations that join in filing a consolidated Federal income tax return (\u201cParent \nAffiliated Group\u201d).   Seller is a domestic corporation that is unrelated to any member of \nParent Affiliated Group.  Seller currently owns interests in multiple projects -------------------\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n(\u201cProjects\u201d).  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n------------------------------------------------- The Projects are owned indirectly through multiple \ntiers of entities including operating entities that directly own and operate the Projects \n(\u201cOperating Entities\u201d).  \nA member of Parent Affiliated Group entered into a Letter of Intent on Date 1 with \nSeller providing for the purchase by Newco (described below) of an indirect interest in the \nProjects for an aggregate purchase price of approximately b (\u201cPurchase Price\u201d) pursuant \nto a single purchase agreement (\u201cPurchase Agreement\u201d).  The parties later agreed to an \nincrease in the number of Projects underlying the transaction, along with an increase in \nthe Purchase Price to approximately c.  ------------------------------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n--------------------------------------------------------\nIn order to effect the proposed transaction, Seller formed a limited partnership \n(\u201cLP\u201d) under the laws of State A that will hold indirect interests in the Projects.  Newco will \npurchase a limited partnership interest and a general partnership interest in the LP \n(collectively, Newco\u2019s \u201cinterest\u201d in the LP).  A limited liability company wholly owned by \nSeller (\u201cLLC\u201d) ------------------------------- will hold the remaining interests in the LP.  \nReferences to \u201cSeller\u201d herein include references to the LLC as applicable.  A portion of \nthe Purchase Price will be contributed by Newco to the LP and will be paid by the LP to \nSeller in consideration for Seller\u2019s undertakings in the Payment and Authority Agreement -\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------.  The anticipated closing date \nfor the LP investment (\u201cClosing Date\u201d) is on or before Date 2.\nNewco is a recently incorporated State A corporation.  Newco is authorized to \nissue only a single class of stock, which is common stock.  The shares of Newco common \nstock that are issued and outstanding at any time will be referred to as the \u201cNewco \nCommon Stock.\u201d  On or prior to the Closing Date, one or more members of Parent \nAffiliated Group (acting directly or through a disregarded entity) will make a capital \ncontribution to Newco equal to e% of the Purchase Price plus an additional amount \nnecessary to pay transaction expenses, if any.  Newco has not issued any options or \nother rights to purchase its stock.  Newco will pay f% (100 minus e%) of the Purchase \nPrice by delivering a promissory note to Seller (\u201cSeller Financing Note\u201d) and the balance \nin cash.\nPLR-139967-09\n4\nThe by-laws of Newco (\u201cBy-laws\u201d) provide for a board of directors (\u201cNewco Board\u201d) \nconsisting of three members.  Newco\u2019s shareholders will elect all members of the Newco \nBoard.  The Newco certificate of incorporation (\u201cCharter\u201d) and By-laws do not limit the \npowers of the Newco Board or the powers of the shareholders granted under State A law, \nexcept that the By-laws include guidelines (\u201cGuidelines\u201d) that restrict the activities of \nNewco.  \nThe Guidelines limit Newco\u2019s activities to the following: (a) acquiring, holding, and \ndisposing of its LP interest, and making additional capital contributions or loans to the LP; \n(b) entering into a tax sharing agreement (\u201cTax Allocation Agreement\u201d) described below \nwith Parent; (c) entering into the Seller Financing Note and related documentation (\u201cSeller \nFinancing Loan Documents\u201d) with Seller as lender; (d) ----------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------; (e) issuing new shares of stock for \nconsideration or accepting additional capital contributions from stockholders, provided \nthat the share issuances are not in breach of the Seller Financing Loan Documents; (f) \nentering into certain pledge and related agreements (Pledge and Security Agreement and \nCollateral Agency Agreement) and an Early Buy-Out Agreement (as described below) \nwith Seller and other parties, and entering into operating agreements of entities owned by \nthe LP; (g) investing proceeds from the LP, the Tax Allocation Agreement, the Payment \nand Authority Agreement, the Put Option Agreement, the Pledge and Security \nAgreement, and the Early Buy-Out Agreement in demand deposits, U.S. Treasury \nsecurities, debt obligations of or guaranteed by Parent, or equity in money market funds \nholding U.S. Treasury securities; (h) executing documents, exercising rights, fulfilling \nobligations and other activities to the extent necessary or helpful to carry out or facilitate \nthe foregoing, including incurring ordinary course trade payables; and (i) making dividend \nor other distributions on Newco Common Stock, provided they are not made in breach of \nthe Seller Financing Loan Documents.  The Guidelines also provide that Newco shall not \neffect a dissolution, winding up, liquidation, consolidation or merger, or incur, create or \nassume any indebtedness or other liabilities in breach of the Seller Financing Loan \nDocuments.\nThe By-laws may be amended by the Newco Board or Newco\u2019s shareholders but \nthe Guidelines and the amendment provision in the By-laws may not be amended in \nbreach of the Seller Financing Loan Documents.  As discussed below, the Seller \nFinancing Loan Documents will prohibit any change in the Guidelines without consent of \nSeller while the Seller Financing Note is outstanding.  \nThe Charter and By-laws do not impose additional limitations on the ability of the \nNewco Board to declare and pay dividends beyond those imposed by State A law and the \nSeller Financing Loan Documents.  The Seller Financing Loan Documents will allow \nNewco to pay dividends if all required debt service payments have been made and there \nare no events of default under the Seller Financing Loan Documents that have occurred \nand are continuing.  It is not anticipated that dividends would be limited due to insolvency \nconcerns as Newco is not expected to become insolvent.\nPLR-139967-09\n5\nParent will enter into a Tax Allocation Agreement with Newco that will require \nParent to make periodic payments to Newco for making available ordinary losses and -----\n--------- whether or not used by the Parent Affiliated Group, and will require Parent to \nmake payments to Newco for other tax benefits to the extent actually used by the Parent \nAffiliated Group.  It is anticipated that Newco will use payments from Parent under the \nTax Allocation Agreement to make debt service payments on the Seller Financing Note.  \nAs described below, the Tax Allocation Agreement will be pledged to Seller under the \nSeller Financing Loan Documents.  \nThe parties intend to treat the LP as a partnership for Federal income tax \npurposes.  Newco---------------------------and Seller will enter into a Limited Partnership \nAgreement (\u201cLP Agreement\u201d).  Under the LP Agreement, the LP will be a special purpose \nentity that indirectly owns interests in the Projects and only undertakes activities related to \nits investment in the Projects. \nNewco\u2019s economic interest in the LP will be represented by a limited partnership \ninterest.  In addition, Newco ------------------------------ will ------ have a general partnership \ninterest in the LP during an initial period (\u201cInitial Period\u201d).  The Initial Period will be at least \ng months.  The general partnership interest will give Newco --------------------------------------\ncertain management rights and a de minimis economic interest.  -----------Newco ------------\n------------------------- will be allocated h% of the operating profits, losses, gain or loss from \ncapital transactions ----------------------------------------- of the LP during the Initial Period and \ni% after the end of the Initial Period (or the Extension Period, if applicable).  The LP \nagreement provides for an \u201cExtension Period\u201d to begin immediately following the Initial \nPeriod if Newco\u2019s ------------------------------ return on its investment in the LP fails to meet \ncertain conditions.  Newco\u2019s LP allocation percentage will not change to i% until the end \nof the Extension Period (if any).  Extension Period LP allocation percentages will be \ndetermined at the end of the Initial Period.  Seller will hold all interests in the LP not held \nby Newco -------------------------------and will be allocated all items not allocated to Newco ---\n-------------------------.  Distributions of available net operating cash flow will be made in \naccordance with these percentages.    \nThe LP Agreement will impose some restrictions on Newco\u2019s ability to transfer its \ninterest in the LP.  Without Seller\u2019s consent, Newco will not be able to transfer its interest \nin the LP (including a transfer of beneficial ownership without admitting the transferee as \na partner) (1) to certain categories of persons who have business or other interests that \nconflict with those of Seller, (2) in a way that would cause a technical termination of the \nLP under section 708, (3) while there is a material breach by Newco of the Seller \nFinancing Loan Documents, (4) in violation of certain legal restrictions, (5) such that its \ninterest in the LP is divided among more than two persons that are not affiliates, and (6) if \nthe transfer would cause the LP to have a new general partner other than Newco, ----------\n--------------------------or Seller (or any of their affiliates).  Subject to the restrictions \ndescribed in the preceding sentence (and any restrictions under the Seller Financing \nLoan Documents), Newco may transfer beneficial ownership of its interest in the LP to \nany person without admitting the transferee as a partner, so long as Newco is not in \nPLR-139967-09\n6\nmaterial breach of the Seller Financing Loan Documents and the transferee has no right \nto exercise any of the rights and powers of a partner, or enforce the provisions of the LP \nAgreement, the Purchase Agreement, the Payment and Authority Agreement, the Early \nBuy-Out Agreement, the Put Option Agreement, or the Pledge and Security Agreement.  \nA transferee may be admitted as a partner only with Seller\u2019s consent, but such consent \nmay not be unreasonably withheld.  \nThe LP Agreement will grant an option to Seller (\u201cBuyback Option\u201d) to cause the \nLP to redeem Newco\u2019s --------------------------------- interests in the LP during the Initial \nPeriod in the event the LP has suffered a significant reduction in anticipated tax benefits \nfrom the Projects.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n----------------------------------------------------------------  The exercise price may be adjusted \nafter the Buyback Option settlement date to account for certain adverse Internal Revenue \nService (\u201cIRS\u201d) adjustments (\u201cTax Detriments Guaranty\u201d) and any final tax information \nreceived after the settlement date.  \nIf an entity indirectly owned by the LP realizes materially fewer tax benefits than \noriginally projected, Seller will have the right under the LP Agreement to remove the LP\u2019s \nindirect interest in that entity and replace it with direct or indirect interests in new entities \nor increased interests in entities in which the LP already owns an indirect interest, subject \nto Newco\u2019s --------------------------------- consent, not to be unreasonably withheld. \nUnder the LP Agreement, Newco will be granted the right to force a redemption of \nits interest in the LP (\u201cRedemption Option\u201d).  The Redemption Option is exercisable \nduring a k day period after the end of the Initial Period (\u201cInitial Redemption Option \nPeriod\u201d).  Newco has a similar right to exercise the Redemption Option earlier upon the \noccurrence of certain events of default relating to Seller, the LP or certain entities owned \ndirectly by the LP.   The LLC or its designee may in its discretion elect to purchase the \ninterest directly in lieu of causing the LP to redeem the interest.  Under the Put Option \nAgreement, Newco will be granted an option (\u201cPut Option\u201d) to sell its limited partnership \n(but not its general partnership) interest in the LP to Seller in the event that (i) the LP fails \nto redeem the interest on exercise of the Redemption Option, (ii) there is a legal \nimpediment to Newco exercising the Redemption Option or to the LP redeeming Newco\u2019s \nLP interest, or (iii) an event of bankruptcy occurs with respect to the LP between the date \nof exercise and the date of settlement with respect to one of the options in the transaction \nor an event of bankruptcy occurs with respect to Seller.  --------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-------------------------------------------------------------\nIf Newco does not exercise its Redemption Option or the Put Option, Seller does \nnot exercise the Buyback Option, and Newco\u2019s Shareholder does not exercise the Early \nPLR-139967-09\n7\nBuy-Out Option described below, the LP will indemnify Newco on an after-tax basis for \nlosses of tax benefits in respect of the Initial Period resulting from an IRS audit (i) if there \nis a determination that the --------------- losses actually produced by the Projects and \nflowing through to the LP do not flow through to Newco in accordance with its percentage \ninterest in the LP; (ii) if certain Code sections apply to deny or decrease depreciation \ndeductions or reduce the tax basis of the LP\u2019s property; (iii) if the ------------------ is not \namortizable as expected; or (iv) if any judicial doctrine is applied to the transactions \ndescribed herein to disallow some or all of the tax benefits (\u201cStructural Guaranty\u201d).  In \naddition, if Shareholder exercises the Early Buy-Out Option and the exercise price was \ndetermined using the FMV Price (described below), the Structural Guaranty will require \npayments to be made to Newco or Shareholder for any losses of tax benefits after the \nsettlement of the Early Buy-Out Option.  The Structural Guaranty will not protect against \nlosses of tax benefits attributable to certain circumstances including generally a change in \nlaw.  Except after the settlement of the Early Buy-Out Option in the manner described \nabove, the Structural Guaranty will not protect against underperformance by a lower-tier \nentity.   Except after the settlement of the Early Buy-Out Option in the manner described \nabove or in the case of clause (ii) of this paragraph, the Structural Guaranty will not \nprotect against an IRS audit of a lower-tier entity.\nUnder the Payment and Authority Agreement, if the LP or the LLC does not have \nthe funds to pay the Redemption Option exercise price, the Early Buy-Out Option \nexercise price, amounts due under the Tax Detriments Guaranty and the Structural \nGuaranty, post-settlement adjustments to the Buyback Option exercise price, or to cure \ncapital contribution defaults under the LP Agreement (\u201cGuarantied Obligations\u201d), then \nSeller will be obligated to advance the necessary funds.  The Payment and Authority \nAgreement will not restrict Newco\u2019s rights to assign its interest in the LP.  Newco may not \nassign the Payment and Authority Agreement without the consent of Seller unless Newco \ntransfers to the same person its interest in the LP in compliance with the LP Agreement \nand the Seller Financing Loan Documents.\nUnder the Payment and Authority Agreement, Newco will delegate to Seller the \nright to exercise the rights Newco otherwise would have as a general partner of the LP so \nlong as Seller or an affiliate is a partner in the LP, Newco is a general partner of the LP, \nand Seller is not in default of its Guarantied Obligations or any of its obligations under the \nPut Option Agreement.  The delegation will also terminate upon the occurrence of certain \nfinancial triggering events indicating a certain level of financial distress at Seller.  Seller \nwill have certain rights to restore delegation after an early termination by ----------------------\n------------curing a default, or demonstrating an ability to satisfy its Guarantied Obligations.\nNewco\u2019s direct shareholder (\u201cShareholder\u201d), Seller and Newco will enter into an \nEarly Buy-Out Agreement under which the LLC will grant to Shareholder an option (\u201cEarly \nBuy-Out Option\u201d) to cause the LLC (or its designee) to purchase l% of the Newco \nCommon Stock.  Exercise of the Early Buy-Out Option will require Shareholder to give at \nleast m months notice prior to the proposed settlement date (\u201cSettlement Date\u201d).  After \ngiving such notice, Shareholder may revoke the notice until a date that is n days after \nPLR-139967-09\n8\ndelivery of the notice, except that a revocation of the notice will not preclude Shareholder \nfrom giving notice of exercise again at a later date.  The first day on which notice of \nexercise may be given will be o months after the Closing Date.  The last day on which \nnotice of exercise may be given under the Early Buy-Out Agreement will be p months \nprior to the earliest date on which the Initial Period may end.  If Newco Common Stock is \ntransferred by Shareholder to other members of the Parent Affiliated Group, those \nmembers will succeed to the rights and obligations of Shareholder under the Early Buy-\nOut Agreement.\nThe exercise price for the Early Buy-Out Option will be an amount equal to the LP \nAmount plus the Other Assets Amount minus the Liability Amount, in each case \ncalculated as of the Settlement Date.  The Seller Financing Note will become immediately \ndue and payable upon the successful settlement of the Early Buy-Out Option on the \nSettlement Date.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ The \u201cOther \nAssets Amount\u201d is the sum of the amount of cash and cash equivalents held by Newco \nand the fair market value of any assets held by Newco other than cash, cash equivalents \nor the LP investment (treating as zero the value of any asset held by Newco (i) in violation \nof the Seller Financing Loan Documents or (ii) which constitutes a debt obligation of or a \nsecurity issued by a member of the Parent Affiliated Group).  The Liability Amount is the \noutstanding balance (principal plus accrued interest) of all liabilities of Newco, including \nany indebtedness secured by Newco stock or assets.\nIf Shareholder gives notice of exercise of the Early Buy-Out Option and does not \nrevoke such notice, at any time prior to the Settlement Date, in lieu of purchasing r\npercent of the Newco Common Stock, Seller will have the right to purchase Newco\u2019s LP \ninterest or cause the LP to redeem Newco\u2019s LP interest (\u201cInterest Acquisition Election\u201d) on \nthe Settlement Date.  Seller will pay a penalty for exercising the Interest Acquisition \nElection in the form of a reduced penalty to Shareholder for exercising the Early Buy-Out \nOption.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-------------------------\nAn accounting firm will provide an estimate of the exercise price prior to the \nanticipated Settlement Date.  The price will be adjusted as needed following the \nSettlement Date to reflect updated tax information received after the Settlement Date; to \nreflect any payments due from Seller in connection with the Tax Detriments Guaranty, or \nin certain cases described above, the Structural Guaranty for the period through the \nPLR-139967-09\n9\nSettlement Date; and to ensure that all fair market value calculations reflect the facts in \nexistence on the Settlement Date.\nUnder the \u201cPledge and Security Agreement,\u201d the LP will provide Newco ---------------\n------------------------- with a security interest in certain of its investments in lower-tier entities \n(and certain lower-tier entities will provide security interests in their investments in other \nlower-tier entities).  The Pledge and Security Agreement protects Newco ----------------------\n------------in the event of a bankruptcy or receivership of Seller, the LP or entities directly \nowned by the LP.   \nThe Seller Financing Note will mature on Date 3.  It will bear interest at a fixed rate, \nwhich will be payable quarterly.  Principal will be payable according to an amortization \nschedule.  Newco will have certain rights to prepay the Seller Financing Note in part \nbefore the end of the Initial Redemption Option Period and in whole following the end of \nthe Initial Redemption Option Period.  It may have limited rights to repay the Seller \nFinancing Note in whole before the end of the Initial Redemption Option Period upon the \noccurrence of certain events (except generally a de minimis amount may not be prepaid).  \nA prepayment in some circumstances will require payment of a penalty of t basis points of \nthe principal balance that is prepaid.  Seller may transfer the Seller Financing Note in \nwhole but not in part.    \nParent will provide a guarantee (\u201cParent Guarantee\u201d) of Newco\u2019s payment \nobligations under the Seller Financing Loan Documents.  In addition, the Seller Financing \nNote will be secured by Newco\u2019s interest in the LP and the Tax Allocation Agreement \n(\u201cCollateral\u201d).  The Seller Financing Loan Documents will prohibit Newco from disposing \nof the Collateral without Seller\u2019s consent while the Seller Financing Note is outstanding \n(other than dispositions through exercise of the Redemption Option or Put Option, the \nBuyback Option, or the Early Buy-Out Option if the Interest Acquisition Election is \nexercised).  The Seller Financing Loan Documents will also prohibit more than u% of \nNewco Common Stock from being transferred or issued to persons other than members \nof the Parent Affiliated Group without Seller\u2019s consent.  After full repayment of the Seller \nFinancing Note, the Collateral may be disposed of without limitation under the Seller \nFinancing Loan Documents. \nThe Seller Financing Note will become immediately due and payable upon \nsuccessful settlement of the Redemption Option, the Put Option, the Early Buy-Out \nOption, or the Buyback Option, or if certain events of default occur (including an \nassignment by Newco or Parent for the benefit of creditors and certain bankruptcy or \ninsolvency events of Newco or Parent).  \nAssuming no events of default have occurred or are continuing, Newco will be \nallowed to make dividend payments to its shareholders in an amount equal to its legally \navailable funds.  \nPLR-139967-09\n10\nThe Seller Financing Loan Documents will also include covenants that Newco will \nnot engage in any dissolution, liquidation or consolidation or merger with or into any other \nbusiness entity, except to the extent permitted; modify, amend, waive, breach or \nterminate the Guidelines, without obtaining the prior written consent of Seller (to be given \nin Seller\u2019s absolute and sole discretion); modify, amend, waive or terminate its \norganizational documents (other than the Guidelines) without obtaining the prior written \nconsent of Seller, unless such action is taken in connection with the repayment in full of \nthe Seller Financing Note, is expressly permitted, or is taken in accordance with the \norganizational documents and such action would not have a material adverse effect; \namend the Tax Allocation Agreement except in limited circumstances; assign, transfer, or \npledge the Tax Allocation Agreement or any rights or obligations thereunder without \nSeller\u2019s consent; permit an assignment of the rights or obligations of Parent under the Tax \nAllocation Agreement except in limited circumstances; create, incur or assume any debt \nother than ordinary course trade payables and operating expenses incurred in the \nordinary course of Newco\u2019s business, except to the extent expressly permitted; or create \nany lien on any portion of the Collateral with limited exceptions.\nIt is assumed for the purposes of this ruling that, because of the rights and \nobligations Seller has under the Seller Financing Loan Documents, LP Agreement, Put \nOption Agreement and Payment and Authority Agreement, Newco will not be \nconsolidated with Parent for financial accounting purposes during the period prior to the \nend of the Initial Redemption Option Period.\nREPRESENTATIONS\nParent had made the following representations in connection with the transaction \ndescribed above:\n1.\nThe Seller Financing Note is treated as indebtedness for Federal income tax \npurposes.\n2.\nWhile particular terms and conditions vary based on negotiations and the \nparticular requirements of the parties, with respect to secured loans made to finance \nequity investments in real property: (1) it is a conventional term for the loan agreement to\nprevent the borrower from disposing of the investment while it is collateral for the loan \nwithout the lender\u2019s consent, and (2) it is conventional for the loan to be made to a special \npurpose entity that holds the investment, and in such a case (x) for the charter or other \ngoverning documents of the borrower to limit the activities of the borrower to holding the \nfinanced investment and engaging in incidental activities and (y) for the loan agreement to \nprohibit changes in those documents without the lender\u2019s consent.  You have provided us \nwith excerpts from articles and other materials supporting this statement.\n3.\nIt is conventional for v investments in projects substantially similar to the \nProjects to be in the form of limited partnership interests or non-managing limited liability \ncompany interests, with control rights limited to consent or veto rights with respect to non-\nPLR-139967-09\n11\nroutine actions proposed either by a developer or a sponsor, and rights to replace the \nsponsor or developer for cause.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------  You have provided us with \nexcerpts from articles and other materials supporting this statement.\n4.\nParent does not anticipate that the Parent Affiliated Group will derive a \nFederal income tax benefit as a result of Newco being the member of the Parent Affiliated \nGroup that purchases the LP interest and enters into the related transactions with Seller \nas compared with Parent being the purchaser of the LP interest.\n5.\nNewco may derive a return from its investment in the LP -------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n------------------------------------------------------------.  Towards the end of the Initial Period, the \nNewco Board will evaluate the LP investment by reviewing the performance of the \nOperating Entities and the Projects, considering updated projections of future \nperformance -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n------------------------, and then decide whether or not to exercise the Redemption Option.  --\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n--------------------------- The fair market value of the LP interest at the time of exercise of the \nRedemption Option would depend on a number of variables.  These include the then \ncurrent state of the market for projects substantially similar to the Projects and alternative \ninvestments (prices are not a fixed percentage of tax benefits but a negotiated amount), \ntax rates (deductions have a higher value if tax rates are higher), the performance of the \nProjects (if they do well, cash distributions may be higher than originally projected), and \ninterest rates (the cost of funding the continuing investment would depend on then \nprevailing market rates). \n6.\nThe exercise price of the Early Buy-Out Option is based on a formula \ndesigned by the parties in a bona fide attempt to achieve a price that is less than or equal \nto the fair market value of the Newco Common Stock on the Settlement Date based on \nthe facts in existence on such date. \nRULING\nPLR-139967-09\n12\nBased solely on the information and representations submitted by Parent set \nforth above, and provided that there are no modifications to the terms of the Newco \nstock or contractual terms described above, including through arrangements not \ndescribed above, so that the description is no longer accurate in all respects that are \nmaterial to this ruling, we rule as follows:\nThe stock of Newco owned by Parent or other members of the Parent Affiliated \nGroup will meet the 80% vote and value test of section 1504(a)(2) so long as Parent or \nother members of the Parent Affiliated Group collectively own (either directly or through \ndisregarded entities) at least 80% of the Newco Common Stock.\nCAVEATS\nNo opinion is expressed or implied about the tax treatment of any other aspect of \nany transaction or item discussed or referenced in this letter, or about the tax treatment \nof any condition existing at the time of, or effects resulting from, any transaction or item \nthat is not specifically covered by the above ruling.\nPROCEDURAL STATEMENTS\nThe ruling contained in this letter is based upon information and representations \nsubmitted by the taxpayer and accompanied by a penalties of perjury statement \nexecuted by an appropriate party.  While this office has not verified any of the material \nsubmitted in support of the request for ruling, it is subject to verification on examination.\nThis ruling letter is directed only to the taxpayer requesting it.

is in response to a ruling request submitted on behalf\nof Funds   through    (collectively, \"Funds\").  Funds request\nextensions of time pursuant to \u00a7301.9100-1(a) of the Procedure\nand Administration Regulations to elect under section 855(a) of\nthe Internal Revenue Code, and Funds    through    also request\nextensions of time to elect under section 851(b).\nFACTS\nFunds are organized as business trusts under the law of\neither State 1 or State 2 and are registered as open-end\ndiversified management companies under the Investment Company Act\nof 1940, 15 U.S.C. section 80a-1 et. seq.  Each Fund is treated\nPLR-115628-00\n5\nas a separate corporation under \u00a7851(g) of the Code.  From their\ninception, Funds have operated in a manner intended to qualify\nthem as regulated investment companies (\"RICs\") under Part I of\nSubchapter M of the Code.  Funds intend to be treated as RICs by\ncomputing taxable income as RICs for their taxable years ended\nDate 1.\nExtensions of time (Forms 7004) for filing the Funds\u2019\nfederal income tax returns for the taxable year ended Date 1 were\ndue on Date 2.  Agent prepared the extensions before the due date\nand sent them to Manager for signature and filing.  The\nextensions were signed on Date 3, four days before Date 2, and\nwere put aside for mailing.  On Date 2 the extensions went to the\nmail room with instructions that the returns had to be sent by\ncertified mail that day.  It was not until Date 4, however, that\nthe extensions were sent to the United States Postal Service and\na certified mail receipt with a postmark was obtained. \nBeginning on or about Date 5, and continuing through Date 6,\nFunds began receiving notices from the IRS Service Center that\ntheir requests for extensions of time were denied.  Some Funds\nnever received notices, and it was assumed that the notices were\nlost in the mailing process.\nInitially, it was not known to what extent the IRS would\nreject the extensions of time to file Forms 1120-RIC; they were\nfiled only one day late.  By Date 6 it was apparent that the\nposition of the Service Center was that they were all invalid,\neven though rejection notices for some of the Funds were not\nreceived.  In Month, the Funds\u2019 management initiated\nconsultations with Firm as to how to remedy the situation, and it\nwas agreed to request relief pursuant to section 301.9100 of the\nregulations. \nFirm is composed of professional tax advisers.  It became\ninvolved with Funds\u2019 failures to elect in Month, when Firm was\ncontacted by Agent.  Firm advised Agent to file returns\nimmediately, and that administrative relief under section\n301.9100 of the regulations would have to be requested.\nThe majority of Funds filed their returns between Dates 7\nand 8, and all Funds had filed their returns by Date 9, the date\nthe returns would have been due had the requests for extensions\nto file the returns been timely filed.\nFunds filed their request for relief under section 301.9100\nof the regulations on Date 10.  After some of Funds began\nreceiving the notices that their Forms 7004 were being denied,\nFunds investigated the extent of the problem; discussed the\nmatter internally with the Funds\u2019 management to assess its\nconsequences; consulted with their outside adviser, Firm, as to\nPLR-115628-00\n6\nthe most appropriate manner to remedy the situation; and\ncommitted the necessary resources to the preparation and filing\nof the request for relief under section 301.9100.\nAll of the Funds had declared and paid dividends by Date 11,\n1999.\nFunds make the following representations:\n1.  The request for relief was filed by the Funds before the\nfailure to make the regulatory elections were discovered by\nthe Service.\n2.  Granting the relief will not result in each of the Funds\nhaving a lower tax liability in the aggregate for all years\nto which the regulatory election applies than each Fund\nwould have had if the election had been timely made (taking\ninto account the time value of money).\n \n3.  The Funds do not seek to alter a return position for\nwhich an accuracy-related penalty has been or could have\nbeen imposed under section 6662 of the Code at the time the\ntaxpayers requested relief and the new position requires or\npermits a regulatory election for which relief is requested.\n4.  Being fully informed of the required regulatory election\nand related tax consequences, the Funds did not choose to\nnot file the election.\nAPPLICABLE LAW\nSection 301.9100-1(c) of the regulations provides, in part,\nthat the Commissioner has discretion to grant a reasonable\nextension of time to make a regulatory election (defined in\nsection 301.9100-1(b) as an election whose deadline is prescribed\nby regulations or by a revenue ruling, a revenue procedure, a\nnotice, or an announcement published in the Internal Revenue\nBulletin), or a statutory election (but no more than 6 months\nexcept in the case of a taxpayer who is abroad), under all\nsubtitles of the Internal Revenue Code except subtitles E, G, H,\nand I.\nSection 301.9100-3(a) through (c)(1)(i) of the regulations\nsets forth rules that the Internal Revenue Service generally will\nuse to determine whether, under the facts and circumstances of\neach situation, the Commissioner will grant an extension of time\nfor regulatory elections that do not meet the requirements of\nsection 301.9100-2.  Section 301.9100-3(b) provides that subject\nto paragraphs (b)(3)(i) through (iii) of section 301.9100-3, when\na taxpayer applies for relief under this section before the\nfailure to make the regulatory election is discovered by the\nPLR-115628-00\n7\nService, the taxpayer will be deemed to have acted reasonably and\nin good faith; and section 301.9100-3(c) provides that the\ninterests of the government are prejudiced if granting relief\nwould result in the taxpayer having a lower tax liability in the\naggregate for all years to which the regulatory election applies\nthan the taxpayer would have had if the election had been timely\nmade (taking into account the time value of money).\nCONCLUSION\nBased upon the facts and representations submitted, it is\nheld that Funds   through    have shown good cause for granting a\nreasonable extension of time to allow them to make an election\nunder \u00a7855(a) of the Code, and Funds    through    have shown\ngood cause for granting them a reasonable extension of time to\nallow them to make an election under \u00a7851(b).  Accordingly, the\ntime for filing the elections is extended to Date 4.\nNo opinion is expressed as to whether the taxpayer's tax\nliability is not lower in the aggregate for all years to which\nthe regulatory election applies than its tax liability would have\nbeen if the election had been timely made (taking into account\nthe time value of money).  Upon audit of the federal income tax\nreturns involved, the district director's office will determine\nthe taxpayer's tax liability for the years involved.  If the\ndistrict director's office determines the taxpayer's liability is\nlower, that office will determine the federal income tax effect.\nThis ruling is limited to the timeliness of Funds\u2019\nelections.  This ruling does not relieve Funds from any penalties\nthey may owe as a result of their failures to file their federal\nincome tax returns on time.  This ruling's application is limited\nto the facts, Code sections, and regulations cited herein.  No\nopinion is expressed as to whether Funds qualify as RICs under\nsubchapter M, part I, of the Code.\nA copy of this letter is being forwarded to the service\ncenter where Funds file their returns with instructions that\nalthough their returns were not timely filed, Funds are to be\ntreated as having made timely elections under \u00a7855(a) and \u00a7851(b)\nof the Code.\nExcept as specifically provided otherwise, no opinion is\nexpressed on the federal income tax consequences of the\ntransaction described above.\nThis ruling is directed only to the taxpayers that requested\nit.  Section 6110(k)(3) of the Code provides that it may not be\nused or cited as precedent.\nPLR-115628-00\n8\nIn accordance with the terms of a power of attorney on file\nin this office, the original of this letter is being sent to you\nand copies are being sent to your authorized representatives.\nSincerely yours,\nRichard Carlisle                         \nActing Deputy Associate Chief Counsel\n(Financial Institutions & Products)\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Non-Adverse"}]}

X and Y have represented the following. \nX and Y operate refineries where they produce fuel that is used exclusively in\nrace vehicles and boats (the racing fuel).  The racing fuel has an octane level of 110,\ncontains lead in excess of that permitted by the Environmental Protection Agency\n(EPA), and does not have detergent additives that the EPA requires for gasoline.  Also,\nthe racing fuel does not meet the ASTM specification (D 4814) for gasoline.  The racing\nfuel is not a gasoline blendstock.  The vehicles in which the racing fuel is used generally\nare not eligible to be registered for highway use in any state.\nSection 4081 imposes a tax on certain removals, entries, and sales of gasoline. \nSection 48.4081-3 of the Manufacturers and Retailers Excise Tax Regulations \nprovides that the refiner of gasoline is liable for tax when the gasoline is removed from\na refinery at the refinery rack.  Section 48.4081-1(b) provides that gasoline means\nfinished gasoline and gasoline blendstocks.  Section 48.4081-1(b) provides that\nfinished gasoline means all products that are commonly or commercially known or sold\nas gasoline and are suitable for use as a motor fuel, other than products that have an\nASTM octane number of less than 75 as determined by the motor method.\n42 U.S.C. 7545 prohibits the sale of gasoline for use as fuel in a motor vehicle if\nthe gasoline does not contain additives to prevent the accumulation of deposits in\nengines or if the gasoline contains lead (subsection (l)) or contains lead or lead\n-2-\nadditives (subsection (n)).  For this purpose, motor vehicle means any self-propelled\nvehicle designed for transporting persons or property on a street or highway. \nIn United States v. Coastal Refining and Marketing, Inc., 911 F.2d 1036 (5th Cir.\n1990), the court held that particular petroleum products were \u201ccommonly or\ncommercially known or sold as gasoline\u201d for purposes of a regulation of the EPA.  The\ncourt based its holding on the fact that the products met the ASTM specification for\ngasoline.  However, the court also noted that the specification does not necessarily\ninclude all types of gasoline that are satisfactory for automotive engines nor does it\nnecessarily exclude gasolines that may perform unsatisfactorily. \nThe racing fuel does not meet the ASTM specification for gasoline.  In addition, it\ncontains lead and does not meet other prescribed standards for gasoline that is\ncommercially sold for use in registered highway vehicles.  Thus, the racing fuel is not\ngasoline. \nAccordingly, based on the representations made, X and Y are not liable for the\ngasoline tax imposed by \u00a7 4081 on the removal of racing fuel from their refinery racks\nbecause the racing fuel is not gasoline. \nThis ruling is directed only to the taxpayers who requested it.  Section 6110(k)(3)\nprovides that it shall not be used or cited as precedent.  \nSincerely yours,\nAssociate Chief Counsel\n(Passthroughs and Special Industries)\nBy:\nRichard A.

Taxpayer B is an electric public utility company engaged in the generation, \ntransmission, distribution, and sale of electric energy in State A.  Taxpayer B is subject \nto the jurisdiction of Commission A and Commission B with respect to the nuclear \ndecommissioning costs included in its cost of service for regulatory purposes.  Taxpayer \nC is an electric public utility company engaged in the generation, transmission, \ndistribution, and sale of electric energy in State A.  Taxpayer C is subject to the \njurisdiction of Commission A and Commission B with respect to the nuclear \ndecommissioning costs included in its cost of service for regulatory purposes.  Taxpayer \nA is a newly-formed generation company and is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Company, \nwhich is wholly-owned by Parent.  Taxpayer B has an ownership interest of-----------\npercent in the Plant; Taxpayer C has a --------percent ownership interest in the Plant.  \nPlant is situated at Location.  Taxpayers B and C are severally obligated to pay all \nexpenditures for the construction, operation, and maintenance of Plant and are entitled \nto the proportionate share of the electric power produced thereby.  Both Taxpayer B and \nTaxpayer C have obligations to decommission the Plant and have established several \nfunds for that purpose.  Taxpayer B has established Taxpayer D as a fund qualified \nunder \u00a7 468A as well as one or more nonqualified funds.  Taxpayer C has established \nTaxpayer E as a fund qualified under \u00a7 468A as well as one or more nonqualified funds.   \n \nBoth Taxpayer B and Taxpayer C have received revised schedules of ruling \namounts through -------.  On X, Taxpayer B contributed the entire 12-month ruling \namount specified in its most recent schedule of ruling amounts to Taxpayer D.  On X, \nTaxpayer C contributed the entire 12-month ruling amount specified in its most recent \nschedule of ruling amounts to Taxpayer E.   \n \n3 \nPLR-129962-06 \n \n \nOn Y, Taxpayer B and Taxpayer C transferred their interests in Plant to Taxpayer \nA.  Taxpayer A assumed certain obligations with respect to Plant, including the \nobligation to decommission Plant.  Also on Y, Taxpayer B transferred Taxpayer D, as \nwell as all nonqualified decommissioning funds relating to the Plant, to Taxpayer A and \nTaxpayer C transferred Taxpayer E as well as all nonqualified decommissioning funds \nrelating to the Plant, to Taxpayer A.  The assets in Taxpayer D and Taxpayer E were \ntransferred to Taxpayer F, a fund established by Taxpayer A and qualified under \u00a7 \n468A.  The transfers of the interests in Plant were approved by Commission B and \nCommission C.   \n \nAs a result of the contributions of the entire ------- ruling amounts on X by \nTaxpayer B to Taxpayer D, and by Taxpayer C to Taxpayer E, excess contributions \nwere made to those Funds.  On Z, Taxpayer A withdrew from Taxpayer F the excess \ncontributions made by Taxpayer B and Taxpayer C, along with earnings on those \nexcess contributions from the day after X thru and including the day before Z.   \n \nTaxpayer has requested the following rulings: \n \nRequested Ruling #1:  Taxpayer B, Taxpayer C, Taxpayer A, Taxpayer D, \nTaxpayer E, and Taxpayer F will not recognize any gain or loss or otherwise take any \nincome or deduction into account by reason of the transfer of assets of Taxpayer D and \nTaxpayer E into Taxpayer F and Taxpayer F will have a basis in the assets received \nfrom Taxpayer D and Taxpayer E equal to the basis of those assets immediately prior to \nthe transfer. \n \nRequested Ruling #2:  No portion of Taxpayer D or Taxpayer E is disqualified by \nreceipt of the excess contributions from Taxpayer B and Taxpayer C, respectively, and \nthat no portion of Taxpayer F is disqualified by the withdrawal of such excess \ncontributions and the earnings thereon. \n \nLaw and Analysis: \n \nRequested Ruling #1 \n \nSection 1.468A-5(a) sets out the qualification requirements for nuclear \ndecommissioning funds.  It provides, in part, that a qualified nuclear decommissioning \nfund must be established and maintained pursuant to an arrangement that qualifies as a \ntrust under state law.   \n \nSection 1.468A-5(a)(1)(iii) provides that an electing taxpayer can establish and \nmaintain only one qualified nuclear decommissioning fund for each nuclear power plant.  \nIf a nuclear power plant is subject to the ratemaking jurisdiction of two or more public \n4 \nPLR-129962-06 \n \n \nutility commissions and any such public utility commission requires a separate fund to \nbe maintained for the benefit of ratepayers whose rates are established or approved by \nthe public utility commission, the separate funds maintained for such plant (whether or \nnot established and maintained pursuant to a single trust agreement) shall be \nconsidered a single nuclear decommissioning fund. \n \nSection 1.468A-6 provides rules applicable to the transfer of an interest in a \nnuclear power plant (and transfer of the qualified nuclear decommissioning fund) where \ncertain requirements are met.  Specifically, section 1.468A-6(b) provides that section \n1.468A-6 applies if-- \n \n(1) Immediately before the disposition, the transferor maintained a qualified \nnuclear decommissioning fund with respect to the interest disposed of; and \n \n(2) Immediately after the disposition-- \n \n(i) The transferee maintains a qualified nuclear decommissioning fund with \nrespect to the interest acquired; \n \n(ii) The interest acquired is a qualifying interest of the transferee in the \nnuclear power plant; \n \n(iii) Either a proportionate amount (which could include all) of the assets of \nthe transferor\u2019s Qualified nuclear decommissioning fund is transferred to a \nqualified nuclear decommissioning fund of the transferee, or the \ntransferor\u2019s entire qualified nuclear decommissioning fund is transferred to \nthe transferee, provided in the latter case (or if the transferee receives all \nof the assets in the transferor\u2019s qualified nuclear decommissioning fund, \nbut not the transferor\u2019s qualified nuclear decommissioning fund) that the \ntransferee acquires the transferor\u2019s entire qualifying interest in the plant; \nand \n \n(iv) The transferee continues to satisfy the requirements of section \n1.468A-5(a)(iii), which permits an electing taxpayer to maintain only one \nqualified nuclear decommissioning fund for each plant. \n \nSection 1.468A-6(c) provides that a disposition that satisfies the requirements of \nsection 1.468A-6(b) will have the following tax consequences at the time it occurs: \n \n(1) Neither the transferor nor the transferor\u2019s qualified nuclear decommissioning \nfund will recognize gain or loss or otherwise take any income into account by reason of \nthe transfer of a proportionate amount of the assets of the transferor\u2019s qualified nuclear \n \nPLR-129962-06 \n \n \n5 \ndecommissioning fund to the transferee\u2019s qualified nuclear decommissioning fund (or by \nreason of the transfer of the transferor\u2019s entire qualified nuclear decommissioning fund \nto the transferee).  For purposes of the regulations under section 468A, this transfer (or \nthe transfer of the transferor\u2019s qualified nuclear decommissioning fund) will not be \nconsidered a distribution of assets by the transferor\u2019s qualified nuclear decommissioning \nfund. \n \n(2) Neither the transferee nor the transferee\u2019s qualified nuclear decommissioning \nfund will recognize gain or loss or otherwise take any income into account by reason of \nthe transfer of a proportionate amount of the assets of the transferor\u2019s qualified nuclear \ndecommissioning fund to the transferee\u2019s qualified nuclear decommissioning fund (or by \nreason of the transfer of the transferor\u2019s entire qualified nuclear decommissioning fund \nto the transferee).  For purposes of the regulations under section 468A, this transfer (or \nthe transfer of the transferor\u2019s qualified nuclear decommissioning fund) will not \nconstitute a payment or a contribution of assets by the transferee to its qualified nuclear \ndecommissioning fund. \n \n(3) Transfers of assets of a qualified nuclear decommissioning fund to which this \nsection applies do not affect basis.  Thus, the transferee\u2019s qualified nuclear \ndecommissioning fund will have a basis in the assets received from the transferor\u2019s \nqualified nuclear decommissioning fund that is the same as the basis of those assets in \nthe transferor\u2019s qualified nuclear decommissioning fund immediately before the \ndistribution. \n \nUnder section 1.468A-6(g), the Service may treat any disposition of an interest in \na nuclear power plant occurring after December 27, 1994, as satisfying the \nrequirements of the regulations if the Service determines that such treatment is \nnecessary or appropriate to carry out the purposes of section 468A. \n \nRequested Ruling #2 \n \n \nSection 468A(a) and section 1.468A-2(a) provide that a taxpayer that elects the \napplication of section 468A may deduct in the taxable year the election is made any \npayments made by the taxpayer to a qualified nuclear decommissioning fund in that \nyear. \n \n \nFormer section 468A(b) and section 1.468A-(2)(b)(1) provide that, for purposes \nof section 1.468A-2(a), the amount that a taxpayer may pay into a qualified nuclear \ndecommissioning fund for any taxable year shall not exceed the lesser of the amount of \nnuclear decommissioning costs allocable to the fund which is included in the taxpayer's \ncost of service for ratemaking purposes for the taxable year, or the ruling amount \napplicable to fund for that the taxable year.  Section 1.468A-2(b)(1) provides further that \nif the amount of cash payments made (or deemed made) to a qualified nuclear \n \nPLR-129962-06 \n \n \n6 \ndecommissioning fund during any taxable year exceeds the limitation of section 1.468A-\n2(b)(1), the excess is not deductible by the electing taxpayer.   \n \nSection 1.468A-5(a)(2) prohibits a nuclear decommissioning fund from accepting \nany contribution for which a deduction is not permitted under section 468A(a) and \nsection 1.468A-2(a).  Section 1.468A-5(c)(1) provides that, if at any time during a \ntaxable year of a nuclear decommissioning fund the fund does not satisfy the \nrequirements of section 1.468A-5(a), the Service may, in its discretion, disqualify all or \nany portion of the fund as of the date that the fund does not satisfy the requirements of \nsection 1.468A-5(a).    \n \n \nSection 1.468A-2(c)(2) provides that the amount of any cash payment made by \nan electing taxpayer to a qualified nuclear decommissioning fund on or before the 15th \nday of the third calendar month after the close any taxable year shall be deemed made \nduring that taxable year if the electing taxpayer irrevocably designates the amount as \nrelating to that taxable year on its timely filed Federal income tax return for that taxable \nyear. \n \n \nSection 1.468A-5(c)(2)(ii) defines an excess contribution for purposes of section \n1.468A-5(c)(2) as the amount by which cash payments made (or deemed made) to a \nqualified nuclear decommissioning fund during any taxable year exceed the payment \nlimitation in former section 468A(b) and section 1.468A-2(b). \n \n \nSection 1.468A-5(c)(2)(i) provides that a qualified nuclear decommissioning fund \nwill not be disqualified under section 1.468A-5(c)(1) by reason of an excess contribution \nor the withdrawal of that excess contribution by an electing taxpayer if the amount of the \nexcess contribution is withdrawn by the electing taxpayer on or before the date \nprescribed by law (including extensions) for filing the return of the fund for the taxable \nyear for which the excess contribution relates.   \n \n \nSection 1.468A-2(d)(2)(ii) provides that the amount of a withdrawal of an excess \ncontribution (as defined in section 1.468A-5(c)(2)(ii)) by an electing taxpayer pursuant to \nthe rules of section 1.468A-5(c)(2) shall not be included in the gross income of the \nelecting taxpayer. \n \nConclusions: \n \n \nTaxpayer B, Taxpayer C, Taxpayer A, Taxpayer D, Taxpayer E, and Taxpayer F \nwill not recognize any gain or loss or otherwise take any income or deduction into \naccount by reason of the transfer of assets of Taxpayer D and Taxpayer E into \nTaxpayer F and Taxpayer F will have a basis in the assets received from Taxpayer D \nand Taxpayer E equal to the basis of those assets immediately prior to the transfer. \n \n \nPLR-129962-06 \n \n \n7 \n \nWith respect to the excess contributions and the subsequent withdrawal of those \nexcess contributions, the Service will not disqualify any part of Taxpayer D, Taxpayer E, \nor Taxpayer F as a result of these transactions.   \n \nThe rulings contained in this letter are based upon information and \nrepresentations submitted by the Taxpayers and accompanied by a penalty of perjury \nstatement executed by an appropriate party.   While this office has not verified any of \nthe material submitted in support of the request for rulings, it is subject to verification on \nexamination. \n \nExcept as specifically determined above, no opinion is expressed or implied \nconcerning the Federal income tax consequences of the transaction described above. \n \nEffective January 1, 2006, amendments were made to \u00a7 468A by the Energy Tax \nIncentives Act of 2005, Pub. L. 109-58, 119 Stat. 594.  Regulations based on these \namendments are being developed but have not yet been proposed.  The discussion \nabove is based on the law in effect prior to January 1, 2006.  However, this ruling will be \nmodified or revoked by the adoption of temporary or final regulations to the extent the \nregulations are inconsistent with any conclusion in the letter ruling.  See section 11.04 \nof Rev. Proc. 2007-1, 2007-1 I.R.B. 1, 49.  However, when the criteria in section 11.05 \nof Rev. Proc. 2007-1, 2007-1 I.R.B. 50, are satisfied, a ruling is not revoked or modified \nretroactively except in rare or unusual circumstances. \n \nThis ruling is directed only to the Taxpayers who requested it.  Section 6110(k)(3) \nof the Code provides it may not be used or cited as precedent.  In accordance with the \npower of attorney on file with this office, a copy of this letter is being sent to the \nTaxpayer.  We are also sending a copy of this letter ruling to the Director.  Pursuant to \n\u00a71.468A-7(a), a copy of this letter must be attached (with the required Election \nStatement) to the Taxpayers' federal income tax return for each tax year, if any, in which \nthe Taxpayer claims a deduction for payments made to the Fund.  \n \nSincerely, \n \nPeter C.

The information \nsubmitted in that request and in later correspondence is summarized below.\nSummary of Facts\nDistributing is a closely held, State X corporation that was incorporated on Date \n1.  Distributing made a Subchapter S election on Date 2 (more than 10 years ago).  \nDistributing is engaged in Business 1, Business 2 and Business 3.  Distributing has \nsubmitted financial information which indicates that Business 1 and Business 2 have \nhad gross receipts and operating expenses representative of the active conduct of a \ntrade or business for each of the past five years.  Some of the Business 2 assets and \nliabilities are in LLC1, which is wholly owned by Distributing and which Distributing \nrepresents is a disregarded entity.\nDistributing has three classes of common stock: (1) Class A voting stock; \nPLR-116369-08\n4\n(2) Class B nonvoting stock; and (3) Class C voting stock.   Shareholder 1 and \nShareholder 2, together with family trusts, own all the issued and outstanding \nDistributing Class A stock.  A Trust, B Trust, C Trust, D Trust, E Trust, F Trust, G Trust, \nand H Trust (\u201cBeneficiary 1 Trusts\u201d) and I Trust, J Trust, K Trust, L Trust, M Trust, and N \nTrust ( \u201cBeneficiary 2 Trusts\u201d) own respectively bb percent and cc percent of the issued \nand outstanding shares of Distributing Class A stock.   \nOn Date 3, Distributing issued to Beneficiary 1 nonstatutory stock options \nin exchange for services.  The options entitle Beneficiary 1 to acquire dd shares \nof Distributing Class A stock.  The options were not issued pursuant to an \nincentive stock option plan that was approved by the shareholders of Distributing.  \nThe options are not actively traded on an established market.  The grant of the \noptions is subject to the Distributing Stock Option Agreement (Agreement).  The \nAgreement provides that the options shall not be transferable by Beneficiary 1 \nexcept by will or the laws of descent and distribution and shall be exercisable \nduring Beneficiary 1\u2019s lifetime only by Beneficiary 1.\nDistributing incorporated Controlled in State X on Date 4 to effectuate the \nproposed transaction (\u201cProposed Transaction\u201d).  Controlled has two classes of \nauthorized and outstanding stock: Class A voting common stock and Class B nonvoting \npreferred stock.  Controlled is wholly owned by Distributing.  Distributing filed Form \n8869 (\u201cQualified Subchapter S election Classification\u201d) (\u201cQSUB Election\u201d) to treat \nControlled as a qualified Subchapter S subsidiary (\u201cQSUB\u201d) of Distributing, effective as \nof the date of incorporation.\nEach nonstatutory stock option held by Beneficiary 1 that is outstanding \nimmediately before the Proposed Transaction will be exchanged for an option to acquire \nControlled Class A Stock with the same terms and conditions as the option to acquire \nDistributing Class A Stock.  None of the options to acquire Distributing Class A Stock \nhad a readily ascertainable fair market value within the meaning of \u00a7 1.83-7(b) of the \nIncome Tax Regulations at the time the options were granted.   None of the options to \nacquire Controlled Class A Stock will have a readily ascertainable fair market value \nwithin the meaning of \u00a7 1.83-7(b) at the time the options are granted.\nFor what are represented to be valid business purposes, Distributing proposes \nthe following Proposed Transaction: \n(i) \nDistributing proposes to transfer to Controlled its entire membership \ninterest in LLC1 and Business 2 and Business 3 assets and liabilities (the \n\u201cContribution\u201d).  The assets of Business 2 include trade receivables, \ninventory, machinery, equipment, licenses, trademarks, and other assets.  \nThe liabilities that will be transferred include trade payables, accrued \ncompensation, and other current liabilities related to Business 2.\nPLR-116369-08\n5\n(ii) \nDistributing proposes to distribute all of the issued and outstanding shares \nof Controlled Class A stock in exchange for all of the shares of Distributing \nClass A stock held by the Beneficiary 1 Trusts and the Beneficiary 2 \nTrusts and all of the issued and outstanding shares of Controlled Class B \nstock to Shareholder 1 in exchange for a portion of the Distributing Class \nA stock held by Shareholder 1 (the \u201cDistribution\u201d).  Beneficiary 1 Trusts, \nBeneficiary 2 Trusts and Shareholder 1 are hereinafter referred to as the \n\u201cExchanging Shareholders\u201d.\nRepresentations\nThe following representations have been made with respect to the Proposed \nTransaction:\n(a) The fair market value of the Controlled stock to be received by the Exchanging \nShareholders will be approximately equal to the fair market value of the \nDistributing stock surrendered by the Exchanging Shareholders in the exchange.\n(b) No part of the consideration to be distributed by Distributing will be received by \nany of the Exchanging Shareholders as creditor, employee, or in any capacity \nother than that of a shareholder of Distributing.\n(c) The five years of financial information submitted on behalf of Distributing is \nrepresentative of Distributing\u2019s present operation, and with regard to such \ncorporation, there have been no substantial operational changes since the date \nof the last financial statements submitted.\n(d) Following the transaction, Distributing and Controlled each will continue the \nactive conduct of its business, independently and with its separate employees, \nexcept that Distributing and Controlled will be a party to a Transitional Services \nAgreement whereby certain services will be provided by one entity to the other \nfollowing the Distribution.  \n(e) The distribution of the stock of Controlled is carried out for the following \ncorporate business purposes: to resolve shareholder and management conflicts, \nfit and focus, to create operational efficiencies, for risk alignment and liability \nprotection, and to reduce the likelihood of unionization of certain workers.  The \ndistribution of the stock of Controlled is motivated, in whole or substantial part, \nby one or more of these corporate business purposes.\n(f) The transaction is not used principally as a device for the distribution of the \nearnings and profits of Distributing or Controlled or both.\nPLR-116369-08\n6\n(g) No investment credit property is deemed to be transferred between Distributing \nand Controlled as part of the Proposed Transaction. \n(h) No consideration will be issued by Controlled to Distributing except for Controlled \nstock deemed issued upon the termination of the QSUB election of Controlled \nimmediately prior to the Distribution.\n(i)\nThe total adjusted bases and the fair market value of the assets deemed to be \ntransferred to Controlled by Distributing each will equal or exceed the sum of the \nliabilities deemed to be assumed (as determined under \u00a7 357(d)) by Controlled; \nand the liabilities deemed assumed (as determined under \u00a7 357(d)) in the \ntransaction were incurred in the ordinary course of business and are associated \nwith the assets deemed to be transferred.\n(j)\nFor purposes of \u00a7 355(d), immediately after the Distribution, no person \n(determined after applying \u00a7 355(d)(7)) will hold stock possessing 50 percent or \nmore of the total combined voting power of all classes of Distributing stock \nentitled to vote, or 50 percent or more of the total value of shares of all classes of \nDistributing stock, that was acquired by purchase (as defined in \u00a7 355(d)(5) and \n(d)(8)) during the five-year period (determined after applying \u00a7 355(d)(6)) ending \non the Distribution date.\n(k) For purposes of \u00a7 355(d), immediately after the Distribution, no person \n(determined after applying \u00a7 355(d)(7)) will hold stock possessing 50 percent or \nmore of the total combined voting power of all classes of Controlled stock \nentitled to vote, or 50 percent or more of the total value of shares of all classes of \nControlled stock, that was either (i) acquired by purchase (as defined in \n\u00a7355(d)(5) and (8)) during the five-year period (determined after applying \n\u00a7355(d)(6)) ending on the Distribution date, or (ii) attributable to dispositions on \nDistributing stock that was acquired by purchase (as defined in \u00a7 355(d)(5) and \n(8)) during the five-year period (determined after applying \u00a7 355(d)(6)) ending on \nthe Distribution date.\n(l)\nNo two parties to the transaction are investment companies as defined in \n\u00a7\u00a7368(a)(2)(F)(iii) and (iv). \n(m) Distributing is an S corporation (within the meaning of \u00a7 1361(a)).  Immediately \nfollowing the Proposed Transaction, Controlled will elect to be an S corporation \npursuant to \u00a7 1362(a).  There is no plan or intent to revoke or otherwise \nterminate the S corporation election of either Distributing or Controlled.\n(n) No intercorporate debt will exist between the Distributing and Controlled at the \ntime of, or subsequent to, the distribution of the Controlled stock.\nPLR-116369-08\n7\n(o) Payments made in connection with all continuing transactions between \nDistributing and Controlled will be for fair market value based on terms and \nconditions arrived at by the parties bargaining at arm\u2019s length. \n(p) The Distribution is not part of a plan or series of related transactions (within the \nmeaning of \u00a7 1.355-7) pursuant to which one or more persons will acquire \ndirectly or indirectly stock representing a 50 percent or greater interest (within \nthe meaning of \u00a7 355(d)(4)) in Distributing or Controlled (including any \npredecessor or successor of any such corporation).\nRulings\nBased solely on information submitted and the representations set forth above, we \nrule as follows:\n(1)\nThe Distribution will cause a termination of the QSUB election of \nControlled because Controlled will cease to be a wholly-owned subsidiary \nof an S corporation.  Upon the Distribution, Controlled will be treated as a \nnew corporation acquiring all of its assets and assuming all of its liabilities \nimmediately before the termination of Controlled\u2019s QSUB election in \nexchange for the stock of Controlled (the Contribution) (\u00a7\u00a7 1361(b)(3)(B) \nand (C)).\n(2)\nThe Contribution, followed by the Distribution, will constitute a \nreorganization within the meaning of \u00a7 368(a)(1)(D).  Distributing and \nControlled each will be \"a party to the reorganization\u201d within the meaning \nof \u00a7 368(b).\n(3)\nNo gain or loss will be recognized by Distributing upon the Contribution.  \n(\u00a7\u00a7 357(a) and 361(a)).\n(4)\nNo gain or loss will be recognized by Controlled on the Contribution \n(\u00a71032(a)).\n(5)\nThe basis of each asset received by Controlled in the Contribution will \nequal the basis of that asset in the hands of Distributing immediately prior \nto its transfer (\u00a7 362(b)).\n(6)\nThe holding period of each asset received by Controlled from Distributing \nin the Contribution will include the holding period of such asset in the \nhands of Distributing (\u00a7 1223(2)).\n(7)\nNo gain or loss will be recognized by Distributing upon the Distribution \n(\u00a7361(c)).\nPLR-116369-08\n8\n(8)\nNo gain or loss will be recognized by (and no amount will be included in \nthe income of) the Exchanging Shareholders upon their receipt of \nControlled stock in exchange for their Distributing stock in the Distribution \n(\u00a7 355(a)).  \n(9)\nThe aggregate basis of the Controlled stock in the hands of the \nExchanging Shareholders immediately after the Distribution will be the \nsame as the aggregate basis of the Distributing stock, immediately before \nthe Distribution, exchanged therefor by the Exchanging Shareholders \n(\u00a7\u00a7358(a) and (b)).  If the Distributing stock held by Shareholder 1 \nimmediately before the Distribution has different bases (e.g., shares of \nstock were acquired at different times and at different prices), the bases of \nthe Distributing blocks of shares will be allocated between the Controlled \nblocks and his retained Distributing blocks (block by block allocation).  If \nthe Distributing stock held by the Beneficiary 1 Trusts and the Beneficiary \n2 Trusts immediately before the Distribution has different bases (e.g., \nshares of stock were acquired at different times and at different prices), \nthe bases of the Distributing blocks of shares will be allocated to the \nControlled blocks (block by block allocation).\n(10)\nThe holding period of the Controlled stock received by the Exchanging \nShareholders will include the holding period of their Distributing stock \nsurrendered in the Distribution, provided such shares of Distributing stock \nare held as capital assets in the hands of the Exchanging Shareholders at \nthe time of the Distribution (\u00a7 1223(1)).\n(11)\nDistributing's accumulated adjustments account immediately prior to the \nDistribution will be allocated between Distributing and Controlled in a \nmanner similar to the manner in which Distributing's earnings and profits \nwill be allocated under \u00a7 312(h) and \u00a7 1.312-10(a) (\u00a7 1.1368-2(d)(3)).\n(12)\nDistributing\u2019s momentary ownership of the stock of Controlled, as part of \nthe reorganization under \u00a7 368(a)(1)(D), will not cause Controlled to have \nan ineligible shareholder for any portion of its first taxable year under        \n\u00a7 1361(b)(1)(B).  Controlled may, without requesting the Commissioner's \nconsent, make an S election before the expiration of the five-year period \ndescribed in \u00a7 1361(b)(3)(D) and \u00a7 1361-5(c)(1), provided that:                \n(i) immediately following the termination, Controlled is otherwise eligible to \nmake an S election; and (ii) the election is made effective immediately \nfollowing the termination of the QSUB election (\u00a7 1.1361-5(c)(2)).\n(13)\nControlled will not be subject to the built-in gain provisions of \u00a7 1374.\nPLR-116369-08\n9\n(14)\nSection 83 will not apply to the options to acquire Controlled Class A stock\nthat Beneficiary 1 will receive pursuant to the Proposed Transaction \nbecause the options will not have a readily ascertainable fair market value \non the date of acquisition.  Section 83 will apply when these options are \nexercised or otherwise disposed of (\u00a7\u00a7 83(a) and (b) and \u00a7\u00a7 1.83-7(a) and \n(b)(2)). \n(15)\nNo gain or loss will be recognized by Distributing or Controlled upon the \ngranting of the Beneficiary 1 Controlled stock options in replacement of \nthe Beneficiary 1 Distributing stock options.\nCaveats\nWe express no opinion about the tax treatment of the facts described above \nunder any other provision of the Code or Regulations, or the tax treatment of any \nconditions existing at the time of, or effects resulting from, these facts that are not \nspecifically covered by the above ruling. \nIn particular, this Office has not reviewed any information pertaining to, and has \nmade no determination regarding, whether the Distribution: (i) satisfies the business \npurpose requirement of \u00a7 1.355-2(b), (ii) is being used principally as a device for the \ndistribution of earnings and profits of Distributing or Controlled or both (see \n\u00a7\u00a7355(a)(1)(B) and \u00a7 1.355-2(d)), or (iii) is part of a plan (or series of related \ntransactions) pursuant to which one or more persons will acquire directly or indirectly \nstock representing a 50 percent or greater interest in Distributing or Controlled (see \n\u00a7\u00a7355(e) and \u00a7 1.355-7).  Except as specifically ruled upon above, no opinion is \nexpressed concerning whether either Distributing or Controlled is, in fact, an S \ncorporation for Federal tax purposes or concerning whether any particular shareholder \nof Distributing or Controlled is an eligible S corporation shareholder.  Also, no opinion \nwas requested, and none is expressed or implied, regarding the Federal tax treatment \nof the transitional services; the Federal tax treatment of any agreements regarding \nintellectual property; and the application of \u00a7 409A or any other provision to the options \nin ruling (14).                                                                                                                                             \nThe ruling contained in this letter is based upon information and representations \nsubmitted by the taxpayer and accompanied by a penalty of perjury statement executed \nby an appropriate party.

The rulings in this letter are based on the\nfacts and representations submitted under penalties of perjury in support of the request.\nVerification of that information may be required as part of the audit process.  The\nmaterial information is summarized below.\nTax-Exempt 1 is a State X nonprofit corporation that is described in \u00a7 501(c)(3)\nof the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (\u201cCode\u201d).  Tax-Exempt 1 was\nfounded on Date 1 in order to manage and oversee the Business A activities of its\naffiliates in the Area as part of the mission of Religious Organization 1.  The\nmembership of Tax-Exempt 1 consists of up to 25 individuals.  Of these 25 individuals,\neight are either affiliated with Religious Organization 2 or appointed by its officers,\ntwelve are community directors of Tax-Exempt 1, and the remainder are elected by\nsuch members.  Upon the winding up and dissolution of Tax-Exempt 1, any assets\nremaining after all debts are settled will be distributed to Religious Organization 2, its\nsuccessor, or as directed by the Court.\nTax-Exempt 2 is a State X nonprofit corporation that is described in \u00a7 501(c)(3)\nof the Code.  Tax-Exempt 2 was established on Date 2 to further the Business A\nmission of Religious Organization 1 in the Area.  Tax-Exempt 2 is controlled and\nmanaged by a board of 9 directors a majority of which are chosen by Tax-Exempt 1.\nTax-Exempt 1 is the sole member of Tax-Exempt 2.  Upon the winding up and\ndissolution of Tax-Exempt 2, any assets remaining after all debts are settled will be\ndistributed to Tax-Exempt 1, its successor, or as directed by the Court. \nCompany is a State X corporation that was incorporated on Date 3.  Company\nhas one class of authorized stock, all of which is owned by Tax-Exempt 2.  Prior to Date\n4, Company provided Business B services to Customers located throughout  the Area. \nOn Date 4, Tax-Exempt 1 consolidated certain Business B services, including those\nperformed by Company, into Affiliate.  Since then, Company has performed consulting\nand support services for Tax-Exempt1, Tax-Exempt 2 and other Business A affiliates of\nTax-Exempt 1.  In addition, Company owns a % of LLC, which provides specialized\nBusiness A services in the Area.  Company is a \"loss corporation\" within the meaning of\n\u00a7 382(k)(1) of the Code.\nTax-Exempt 1, Tax-Exempt 2, and Company each computes its federal income\ntax liability using an accrual method of accounting and each files its federal income tax\nreturns on a calendar year basis. \nTax-Exempt 1 is interested in restructuring its Business A network so as to\nimprove administrative efficiency.  Company, Tax-Exempt 1, and Tax-Exempt 2 have\ndetermined that the direct ownership of Company by Tax-Exempt 1 will improve\nadministrative efficiency.  Accordingly, it is proposed that Tax-Exempt 2 distribute all the\nstock in Company to Tax-Exempt 1. \n3\nPLR-152297-01\nExcept for the distribution described above, there is no plan or intention to\nchange the ownership or membership structure of any entity within the affiliate group\nthat includes Tax-Exempt 1, Tax-Exempt 2, and Company.  Neither the proposed\ndistribution, nor any other planned or intended transaction, will in any way have the\neffect of changing the geographic area, the communities, or the classes of beneficiaries\nserved by Tax-Exempt 1, Tax-Exempt 2, and Company.\nBased solely on the information submitted and the representations set forth\nabove, we hold as follows: \n(1) The distribution of the Company stock from Tax-Exempt 2 to Tax- Exempt 1\nwill not result in an ownership change with regard to Company (within the\nmeaning of \u00a7 382(g) of the Code and \u00a7 1.382-2T of the Income Tax\nRegulations).\n(2) The limitation of \u00a7 383 will not apply to Company as a result of the\ndistribution.\nTemporary or final regulations pertaining to one or more of the issues addressed\nin this ruling letter have not yet been adopted. Therefore, the Service may modify or\nrevoke this letter if temporary or final regulations as adopted are inconsistent with any\nconclusions herein. See section 12.04(4) of Rev. Proc. 2000-1, 2000-1 I.R.B. 1, 46.\nHowever, when the criteria in section 12.05 are satisfied, the Service will not revoke or\nretroactively modify a ruling except in rare or unusual circumstances. \nA copy of this letter must be attached to the federal income tax return of each\ntaxpayer involved for the taxable year in which the proposed transaction is\nconsummated.\nThis ruling is directed only to the taxpayer(s) requesting it.  Section 6110(k)(3) of\nthe Code provides that it may not be used or cited as precedent.\nPursuant to a power of attorney on file in this office, a copy of this letter is being\nsent to the first representative listed on that power of attorney.\nSincerely yours,\nCharles Whedbee\nSenior Technician Reviewer, Branch 5\nOffice of Associate Chief Counsel\n(Corporate)\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Non-Adverse"}]}

To meet the shortfall the State issued approximately $X in Obligations on \nDate 1 under applicable State law.  The Obligations mature on Date 3. The State \nanticipates having sufficient money to repay these Obligations.  To enhance the \nmarketability and reduce the cost of the Obligations, the State entered into forward \npurchase warrant agreements with broker-dealers and commercial banks (the \n\u201cParticipants\u201d) under which the Participants agreed to purchase \u201cWarrants\u201d from the \nState at the maturity of the Obligations if the State had insufficient funds to pay the \nObligations.  These Warrants were the subject of a prior ruling (PLR 200336004).  The \nprior ruling provided that the Warrants will be \u201cobligations\u201d of the State for purposes of  \n\u00a7 103.  \n \n \nThe State represents that proceeds of the Obligations were in a sufficient amount \nto cover the State\u2019s cash management needs in the beginning months of Year 2 but that \nexpected cash receipts will be less than expected cash expenditures of the State during \nthe remainder of that year by at least $Y. To cover the expected additional shortfall, the \nState issued Notes on Date 2 that mature on Date 4.  The State anticipates having \nsufficient money to repay these Notes.  However, to enhance the marketability of the \nNotes and reduce their cost, the State entered into letter of credit and loan agreements \n(the \u201cAgreements\u201d) with commercial banks (the \u201cBanks\u201d), under which the Banks agreed \n3 \nPLR-161592-03 \n \n \nto provide letters of credit to secure the payments on maturity of the Notes. If the letters \nof credit are drawn upon and not immediately repaid by the State because the State has \ninsufficient funds, the State will issue the Registered Warrants which will be delivered to \nthe Banks for the unreimbursed draws. Some Notes were issued without credit \nenhancement (the \u201cUnenhanced Notes\u201d). If the State does not have sufficient cash \nresources to pay the Unenhanced Notes at maturity, the holders of the Notes also will \nreceive a Registered Warrant.  \n \n \nEach Registered Warrant will specify the principal amount that the State must \nrepay to holders of the Registered Warrants and also will bear interest at a variable rate \nthat will be a percentage of a market index. The Registered Warrants will be legal, valid \nand binding obligations of the State that are enforceable against the State.  \n \n \nThe State represents that it expects that the Registered Warrants will be repaid \nwithin one year.  According to an opinion from the State Attorney General, the controller \nmay not legally refuse to pay the principal of or interest on any Registered Warrant on \nany date that unapplied money is available in the State\u2019s general fund. In addition, the \nState represents that in the last a years, no registered warrant of the type at issue in this \ncase has been outstanding for more than a few months.  The State also represents that \nif in Year 1, (the year that gave rise to the substantial cash shortfall), both the Warrants \nand the Registered Warrants had been issued, the Registered Warrants and the \nWarrants would have been repaid within b months of their date of issuance, a period \nwhich is less than one year.   \n \nLaw and Analysis: \n   \n \nSection 103(a) provides that, except as provided in subsection (b), gross income \ndoes not include interest on any State or local bond.  Section 103(c)(1) provides that the \nterm \u201cState or local bond\u201d means an obligation of a State or political subdivision thereof. \nSection 1.150-1(b), which generally provides definitions for \u00a7\u00a7 103 and 141-150, defines \nan obligation as any valid evidence of indebtedness under general Federal income tax \nprinciples.   \n \n \nHowever, the word \u201cobligation\u201d in \u00a7 103(c)(1) does not extend to every obligation \nthat includes the payment of interest by a state or political subdivision, but only to those \nobligations which are created in the exercise of a state\u2019s borrowing power, as compared \nwith some other sovereign power.  For example, courts have not found an obligation \nunder \u00a7 103 in condemnation cases because the obligation did not arise as an exercise \nof a state\u2019s borrowing power.  See Drew v. United States, 551 F.2d. 85 (5th Cir. 1977) \n(threat of condemnation is not the exercise of the borrowing power); Holley v. United \nStates, 124 F.2d 909 (6th Cir. 1942), cert. denied, 316 U.S. 685 (1942); United States \n4 \nPLR-161592-03 \n \n \nTrust Co. of New York v. Anderson, 65 F.2d 575 (2d Cir. 1933), cert. denied, 290 U.S. \n683 (1933) (condemnation is not the exercise of the borrowing power).  \n \n \n Obligations under \u00a7 103 are not limited to a particular form such as bonds or \nother securities.  See, e.g., Rev. Rul. 60-179, 1960-C.B. 37 (interest paid by a state \nunder ordinary written agreement for purchase and sale of a house was exempt). \n \n \nIn the instant case, the Banks entered into voluntary arrangements with the State \nto advance the State money under negotiated terms and will receive the Registered \nWarrants in return.  The issue is whether the Registered Warrants will be debt under \ngeneral Federal income tax principles. \n   \n \nNeither the Code nor the regulations define debt for Federal income tax \nprinciples.  However, whether an instrument is a debt has been considered in several \ndifferent areas.  In Gilbert v. Commissioner, 248 F.2d 399, 402 (2d Cir. 1957), cert. \ndenied, 359 U.S. 1002 (1959), the court defined classic debt as \u201can unqualified \nobligation to pay a sum certain at a reasonably close fixed maturity date along with a \nfixed percentage in interest payable regardless of the debtor\u2019s income or lack thereof.\u201d   \nThe court noted that, while some variation from this formula is not fatal to the taxpayer\u2019s \nefforts to have the advance treated as a debt for tax purposes, too great a variation will \npreclude such treatment.   \n \n \nThe characteristics of debt have been explored in cases addressing whether an \narrangement is debt or equity.  In those cases, the determination of debt is based on all \nthe facts and circumstances, with no one factor being decisive.  Fin Hay Realty v. \nUnited States, 398 F.2d 694, 696-697 (3d Cir. 1968); John Kelley Co. v. Commissioner,  \n326 U.S. 521, 530 (1946).  Among the factors courts have considered are the names \ngiven to the certificates evidencing the indebtedness, presence or absence of a fixed \nmaturity date, source of the payments, right to enforce payments of principal and \ninterest, participation in management as a result of the advances, status of the \nadvances in relation to regular corporate creditors, intent of the parties, identity of \ninterest between creditor and stockholder, \u201cthinness\u201d of capital structure in relation to \ndebt, ability of the corporation to obtain credit from outside sources, use to which the \nadvances were put, failure of the debtor to repay and risk involved in making advances. \nSee Dixies Dairies v. Commissioner, 74 T.C. 476, 493 (1980);  see also Notice 94-47, \n1994-1 C.B. 357 (list of factors relevant in debt/equity determination).  Not all of these \nfactors are relevant in the instant case.  We discuss certain relevant factors below. \n    \n \n \nThe obligation to pay a sum certain is one aspect of a debt.  Here, the \nAgreements and the Registered Warrants will require payment of a sum certain that will \nbe determined at the time the Registered Warrants are issued.  In addition, the \nRegistered Warrants will provide for stated interest that is to be paid for the use or \n5 \nPLR-161592-03 \n \n \nforbearance of money.  See Deputy v. du Pont, 308 U.S. 488, 498 (1940).  In exchange \nfor the Banks advancing the State money, the State will pay a variable rate of interest, \nbased on a percentage of a market index, to the Banks.   \n \n \nAnother characteristic of a debt instrument is the right to enforce payment of \nprincipal and interest.  Estate of Mixon v. United States, 464 F.2d 394 (5th Cir. 1972).  \nThe Registered Warrants are legal, valid, binding obligations of the State and are \nenforceable against the State.  If the State fails to pay the Registered Warrants, any \nholder of a Registered Warrant may proceed to protect and enforce its rights under \napplicable State law.  Accordingly, the Banks can enforce the State\u2019s obligation to pay \nprincipal and interest on the Registered Warrants.   \n \n \nAnother indicia of a debt instrument is a fixed maturity date.  The existence of a \nfixed maturity date is a significant factor that indicates the existence of a debtor-creditor \nrelationship.   Miele v. Commissioner, 56 T.C. 556, 566 (1971), aff\u2019d, 474 F.2d 133 (3d \nCir. 1973), cert. denied, 414 U.S. 982 (1973).  However, courts have ruled that the \nabsence of a fixed maturity date is not in itself sufficient to prevent an instrument from \nbeing classified as a debt where there is evidence that the parties expect the amount \nadvanced will be repaid within a short time period.   In Harlan v. Commissioner, 409 \nF.2d 904 (5th Cir. 1969), the court ruled that two advances to insurance companies were \ndebt instruments.  The instruments had no fixed maturity date but were payable on \ndemand. The court noted that both advances were repaid within three years and \nconcluded that the repayment of the instruments in the relatively short time was an \nindication that the parties contemplated an early maturity date.  \n \n \nSimilarly, in Estate of Mixon v. United States, 464 F.2d 394 (5th Cir. 1972), the \ncourt ruled that the advance in question was a bona fide loan and that the absence of a \nfixed date of repayment was not conclusive evidence of equity.  The court noted that \nthere was evidence that the parties contemplated repayment within a maximum of three \nyears.  The court also noted that the advances were in fact repaid within two and one-\nhalf years of their funding.   \n \n \nHere, the Registered Warrants will not have a fixed maturity date.  Instead, once \nissued they will be repaid each day to the extent that there are available funds in the \nState\u2019s general fund.  The State represents that it expects that the Registered Warrants \nwill be repaid within one year.  In support of its claim, the State represents that in the \nlast a years, no registered warrant issued by the State without a maturity date has been \noutstanding for more than a few months.  The State also represents that if in Year 1, \n(the year that gave rise to the cash shortfall), both the Warrants and the Registered \nWarrants had been issued, the Registered Warrants and the Warrants would have been \nrepaid within b months of their date of issuance, a period which is less than one year.   \nTherefore, we find that the Registered Warrants are debt for Federal income tax \n6 \nPLR-161592-03 \n \n \npurposes and are incurred by the State pursuant to the exercise of its borrowing power.  \nAccordingly, we conclude that the Registered Warrants are obligations of the State \nunder \u00a7 103. \n \n \nConclusion: \n \n \nBased on all the facts and circumstances, we conclude that the Registered \nWarrants will be \u201cobligations\u201d of the State under \u00a7 103.   \n \n \nThe ruling contained in this letter is based upon information and representations \nsubmitted by the taxpayer and accompanied by a penalty of perjury statement executed \nby an appropriate party.

The information provided in that letter and in later \ncorrespondence is summarized below. \n \nThe rulings contained in this letter are based on facts and representations \nsubmitted by the taxpayer and accompanied by a penalty of perjury statement executed \nby an appropriate party.  This office has not verified any of the materials submitted in \nsupport of the request for rulings.  Verification of the information, representations, and \n \nPLR-133396-07 \n \n \n3 \nother data may be required as part of the audit process.  In particular, this office has not \nreviewed any information pertaining to, and has made no determination regarding, \nwhether the distribution (described below): (i) satisfies the business purpose \nrequirement of \u00a7 1.355-2(b) of the Income Tax Regulations; (ii) is used principally as a \ndevice for the distribution of the earnings and profits of the distributing corporation or the \ncontrolled corporation or both (see \u00a7 355(a)(1)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code and \n\u00a7 1.355-2(d)); or (iii) is part of a plan (or series of related transactions) pursuant to which \none or more persons will acquire directly or indirectly stock representing a 50-percent or \ngreater interest in the distributing corporation or the controlled corporation (see \u00a7 355(e) \nand \u00a7 1.355-7). \n \nDistributing is engaged in Business X.  Distributing is a lessee under a lease \nagreement with State X.  Distributing\u2019s lease agreement allows it to use certain State X \nproperty at a below-market rate.  This lease agreement is nonassignable.  Distributing\u2019s \nstock is owned by individuals and custodial trusts, as follows: \n \nShareholder \nNumber of \nShares \nPercent \nA \na \nb% \nB \nc \nd% \nC \ne \nf% \nD \ng \nh% \nTrust 1 & \nTrust 2 \ni \nj% \nTotal \nk \nl% \n \n \nFinancial information has been received indicating that Business X has had gross \nreceipts and operating expenses representing the active conduct of a trade or business \nfor each of the past five years. \n \nFor what are represented as valid business reasons, Distributing has proposed \nthe following transaction: \n \n(i) Distributing will transfer to Controlled certain assets of Business X in exchange \nfor all of the outstanding stock of Controlled and the assumption by Controlled of the \nliabilities associated with the transferred business, including liabilities to which such \nassets are subject.  The assets, minus any associated liabilities, will represent \napproximately m% of the net fair market value of all of the operating assets, i.e., minus \nany associated liabilities, of Distributing. \n \n(ii) Since, as noted above, the lease agreement is nonassignable, then, after the \nproposed exchange, the portion of Business X conducted by Controlled will no longer \nhave the legal right to use the State X property described in that agreement.  In other \n \nPLR-133396-07 \n \n \n4 \nwords, Controlled will not have the benefit, i.e., below-market lease rate, of the lease \nagreement in conducting its business. To make up for this loss, Distributing and \nControlled will enter into a Lease Payment Agreement.  That Agreement requires \nDistributing to make an annual payment to Controlled, determined by a formula, based \non what would be its share of the after-tax benefit it would have derived from using the \nlease had the proposed exchange not occurred.  Controlled will use this payment to \nenter into alternative arrangements.  This payment will continue as long as the lease \nremains in effect. \n \n(iii) Distributing will distribute all of the outstanding Controlled stock to A and C, \ntwo of the four shareholders of Distributing, in exchange for all of the outstanding \nDistributing stock owned by A and C.  The distribution of Controlled stock will be \nproportionate to the stock A and C had in Distributing. \n \nIn connection with the proposed transaction, Distributing makes the following \nrepresentations: \n \n(a) With respect to each of the Controlled shareholders, the fair market value of the \nControlled stock and other consideration to be received by such Controlled shareholder \nwill be approximately equal to the fair market value of the Distributing stock surrendered \nby such shareholder. \n(b) No part of the consideration to be distributed by Distributing as part of the \nproposed transaction will be received by a shareholder as a creditor, employee, or in \nany capacity other than that of a shareholder of Distributing. \n(c) The five years of financial information, submitted on behalf of Distributing, is \nrepresentative of its present operations and there have been no substantial operational \nchanges since the date of the last financial statements, submitted. \n(d) Following the distribution, Distributing and Controlled will each continue, \nindependently and with its separate employees, the active conduct of its share of all of \nthe integrated activities of Business X conducted by Distributing prior to the \nconsummation of the transaction. \n(e) The proposed transaction will be carried out for the following corporate business \npurposes: (i) to end the disagreement and difference of opinions existing between A and \nD regarding the future operations of Distributing by separating the interests of those \nshareholders; and (ii) to allow these shareholders to devote their attention to their \nrespective corporations.  The distribution is motivated, in whole or substantial part, by \nthese corporate business purposes. \n(f) The distribution is not used principally as a device for the distribution of the \nearnings and profits of Distributing or Controlled or both. \n(g) For purposes of \u00a7 355(d), immediately after the distribution, no person \n(determined after applying the aggregation rules of \u00a7 355(d)(7)) will hold stock \npossessing 50 percent or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of \n \nPLR-133396-07 \n \n \n5 \nDistributing stock entitled to vote or 50 percent or more of the total value of shares of all \nclasses of Distributing stock that was acquired by purchase (as defined in \u00a7 355(d)(5) \nand (8)) during the five-year period (determined after applying \u00a7 355(d)(6)) ending on \nthe date of the distribution. \n(h) For purposes of \u00a7 355(d), immediately after the distribution, no person \n(determined after applying \u00a7 355(d)(7)) will hold stock possessing 50 percent or more of \nthe total combined voting power of all classes of Controlled stock entitled to vote or 50 \npercent or more of the total value of shares of all classes of Controlled stock that was \neither (i) acquired by purchase (as defined in \u00a7 355(d)(5) and (8)) during the five-year \nperiod (determined after applying \u00a7 355(d)(6)) ending on the date of the distribution, or \n(ii) attributable to distributions on Distributing stock or securities that were acquired by \npurchase (as defined in \u00a7 355(d)(5) and (8)) during the five-year period (determined \nafter applying \u00a7 355(d)(6)) ending on the date of the distribution. \n(i) The total adjusted bases and the fair market value of the assets transferred to \nControlled by Distributing in exchange for the Controlled shares will equal or exceed the \nsum of the amount of the liabilities (if any) assumed (within the meaning of \u00a7 357(d)) by \nControlled in connection with the exchange, including the amount of any liabilities to \nwhich the transferred assets are subject. \n(j) The total fair market value of the assets transferred to Controlled by Distributing in \nexchange for Controlled shares will equal or exceed the aggregate adjusted basis of the \ntransferred assets. \n(k) The liabilities (if any) to be assumed (within the meaning of \u00a7 357(d)) in the \nexchange, including liabilities to which the transferred assets are subject, were incurred \nin the ordinary course of business and are associated with the assets being transferred.  \nThe fair market value of the assets of Controlled will exceed the amount of the liabilities \nof Controlled immediately after the exchange. \n(l) If applicable, the income tax liability for the taxable year in which investment credit \nproperty (including any building to which \u00a7 47(d) applies) is transferred will be adjusted \npursuant to \u00a7 50(a)(1) or (a)(2) (or \u00a7 47, as in effect before amendment by P.L. 101-508, \nTitle 11, 104 Stat. 1388, 536 (1990), if applicable) to reflect an early disposition of such \nproperty. \n(m) Distributing neither accumulated its receivables nor made extraordinary payment \nof its payables in anticipation of the transaction. \n(n) No intercorporate debt will exist between Distributing and Controlled at the time \nof, or subsequent to, the distribution of Controlled stock. \n(o) Payments made in connection with all continuing transactions after the \ndistribution, if any, between Distributing and Controlled will be for fair market value \nbased on terms and conditions arrived at by the parties bargaining at arm's length. \n(p) No two parties to the proposed transaction will be investment companies as \ndefined in \u00a7 368(a)(2)(F)(iii) and (iv). \n \nPLR-133396-07 \n \n \n6 \n(q) The distribution is not part of a plan or series of related transactions (within the \nmeaning of \u00a7 1.355-7) pursuant to which one or more persons will acquire directly or \nindirectly stock representing a 50 percent or greater interest (within the meaning of \n\u00a7 355(d)(4)) in Distributing or Controlled (including any predecessor or successor of any \nsuch corporation). \n(r) Distributing, Controlled, and their respective shareholders will each pay their own \nexpenses, if any, incurred in connection with the distribution. \n(s) Immediately after the Distribution, neither Distributing nor Controlled will be a \ndisqualified investment corporation (within the meaning of \u00a7 355(g)(2)). \nBased solely on the information and representations submitted, we rule as follows \non the proposed transaction: \n(1) The contribution of assets from Distributing to Controlled, as part of the proposed \ntransaction, will qualify as a reorganization under \u00a7 368(a)(1)(D).  Distributing and \nControlled each will be \"a party to a reorganization\" under \u00a7 368(b). \n(2) Distributing will not recognize any gain or loss on the contribution of assets that \nare part of the proposed transaction (\u00a7 361(a)). \n(3) Controlled will not recognize any gain or loss on the receipt of assets from \nDistributing that are part of the proposed transaction (\u00a7 1032(a)). \n(4) Controlled's basis in each asset received from Distributing, as part of the \nproposed transaction, will be the same as the basis of that asset in the hands of \nDistributing immediately before its transfer (\u00a7 362(b)). \n(5) Controlled's holding period in each asset received from Distributing, as part of the \nproposed transaction, will include the period during which Distributing held that asset \n(\u00a7 1223(2)). \n(6) Distributing will not recognize any gain or loss on the distribution of all of the \nControlled stock to A and C in exchange for all of their Distributing stock as part of the \nproposed transaction (\u00a7 361(c)). \n(7) Neither A nor C will recognize any gain or loss (and will not otherwise include any \namount in income) on the receipt of all of the shares of Controlled stock in exchange for \nall of their Distributing stock as part of the proposed transaction (\u00a7 355(a)(1)). \n(8) The basis of the Controlled stock in the hands of each of A and C immediately \nafter the exchange will be the same as that shareholder's basis in the Distributing stock \nheld immediately before the exchange (\u00a7 358(a)(1)). \n(9) The holding period of the Controlled stock received by each of A and C as part of \nthe proposed transaction will include the holding period of the Distributing stock \nexchanged therefor, provided the Distributing stock is held as a capital asset on the \ndate of the Distribution (\u00a7 1223(1)). \n(10) Earnings and profits, if any, will be allocated between Distributing and \nControlled in accordance with \u00a7\u00a7 312(h) and 1.312-10(a). \n \nPLR-133396-07 \n \n \n7 \n \nExcept as expressly provided herein, no opinion is expressed or implied concerning \nthe tax consequences of any aspect of any transaction or item discussed or referenced \nin this letter. \n \nThis ruling is directed only to the taxpayer requesting it.

The\ninformation submitted in that request and later correspondence is summarized below.  \nSUMMARY OF FACTS \nThe Prior Ruling concerned a proposed transaction under \u00a7\u00a7721 and 311.  The\nfacts and representations set forth in the Prior Ruling are hereby incorporated, except\nas modified below, for purposes of this supplemental ruling.  All capitalized terms not\ndefined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to them in the Prior Ruling.\n2\nIn your request, you have indicated that Parent no longer intends to effectuate\nthe Restructuring as described in the Prior Ruling.  Instead, Parent now intends to\nrestructure its operations in the following manner (the \u201cRestructuring\u201d as defined in the\nPrior Ruling will now be redefined so as to refer only to the following revised series of\ntransactions): \n(1) \nParent will, under applicable state law, convert or merge most of its existing\ncorporate subsidiaries into partnerships or disregarded entities for federal\nincome tax purposes. \n(2)\nEither before or after Step (1), Parent and GP Sub, a pre-existing subsidiary of\nParent that is indirectly wholly-owned by Parent (GP Sub is owned by Parent\nthrough a chain of wholly-owned subsidiaries of Parent that will be converted into\npartnerships as part of Step (1) above), will form Partnership, a State X limited\npartnership that will be treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. \nInitially, Partnership will be capitalized with (i) a contribution of cash from GP Sub\nin exchange for the issuance to GP Sub of all of Partnership\u2019s general partner\ninterests and (ii) a contribution of cash from Parent in exchange for all of\nPartnership\u2019s limited partner interests.  Parent intends to cause GP Sub to\nreincorporate in State X and to change its name to GP Sub Renamed prior to\nconsummation of the Restructuring.\n(3)\nAfter the completion of Steps (1) and (2) above, and under applicable State X\nlaw, Parent will merge with and into Partnership, with Partnership surviving the\nmerger (the \u201cMerger\u201d).  Pursuant to the Merger, (i) all of Parent\u2019s remaining\nassets (except for the outstanding stock of GP Sub), subject to all of Parent\u2019s\nremaining liabilities, will be transferred to Partnership and (ii) Parent\nshareholders will receive all of Partnership\u2019s limited partner interests\n(representing approximately p1% of the economic interest in the Partnership)\nand all of GP Sub\u2019s outstanding shares, in each case pro rata, in exchange for\nall of the outstanding Parent Common Stock (the \u201cDistribution\u201d).\n(4) \nFollowing the Restructuring, Partnership and its lower tier entities will continue to\ncarry on the Business A business formerly conducted by Parent and its lower tier\nentities prior to the Restructuring.  Partners in Partnership will include: (i) GP Sub\n(as general partner owning approximately p2% of the economic interest in the\nPartnership) and (ii) the former Parent shareholders (as limited partners owning\napproximately p1% of the economic interest in the Partnership).\nREPRESENTATIONS\nParent reaffirms representation (b), representations (d) through (i), and\nrepresentation (l) contained in the Prior Ruling. \nParent does not reaffirm representation (j) of the Prior Ruling because it pertains\n3\nto a transaction that is not part of the Restructuring as revised herein and thus is not\napplicable to this ruling.\nParent revises representations (a), (c), and (k) of the Prior Ruling as set forth\nbelow:\nRevised Representation (a): \nThe principal purpose of Parent\u2019s transfer of all the Business A assets to \nPartnership, pursuant to the Merger and otherwise in connection with the revised\nRestructuring, is not the recognition of any loss, directly or indirectly, in any such\nassets in connection with the Distribution.  Rather, the principal purpose of\nParent\u2019s transfer of all the Business A assets to Partnership, pursuant to the\nMerger and otherwise in connection with the revised Restructuring, is to\nrestructure the Business A business that was carried on by Parent and its lower\ntier entities prior to the revised Restructuring so that it will be conducted in\npartnership form by Partnership and its lower tier entities on a continuing basis\nfollowing the revised Restructuring.   \nRevised Representation (c):\n \nParent will transfer, pursuant to the Merger and otherwise in connection with the\nrevised Restructuring, all of its assets (other than the outstanding stock of GP Sub) to\nPartnership subject to all of Parent\u2019s liabilities. \nRevised Representation (k):\nFor purposes of measuring \u00a7 336 gain or loss to Parent on the distribution of\nPartnership interests and GP Sub shares, the aggregate value of the distributed\nPartnership interests and GP Sub shares will be equal to the value of the entire\nBusiness A business held by Partnership.  Cf. Pope & Talbot, Inc. v. Commissioner,\n104 T.C. 574 (1995), affirmed 162 F.3d 1236 (9th Cir. 1999).\nParent also makes the following representations in connection with the revised\nRestructuring:\n(aa) \nNo formal or informal plan of liquidation has ever been adopted by Parent,\nexcept for the present plan which is expected to be formally adopted on or\nbefore Date.\n(bb)\nThe liquidation of Parent will not be preceded or followed by the reincorporation\nin, or transfer or sale of all or a part of the business assets of Parent to a\nrecipient corporation (Recipient) that is the alter ego of Parent and which, directly\nor indirectly, is owned more than 20 percent in value by persons holding directly\nor indirectly more than 20 percent in value of Parent\u2019s stock.  For purposes of\nthis representation, ownership has been determined by application of the\nconstructive ownership rules of section 318, as modified by section 304(c)(3). \nCompare Rev.

Taxpayer has requested that the \nconversion of its X Bonds and Y Bonds (collectively, \u201cthe Bonds\u201d) to a new term rate \nperiod and the setting of a new interest rate upon such conversion, all pursuant to the \nterms of the Bonds, will not result in a deemed exchange of the Bonds pursuant to \nsection 1001 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d).\nFACTS\nTaxpayer issued X Bonds on Date 1 and Y Bonds on Date 2.  The Bonds were \nand are intended to qualify as build America bonds within the meaning of section 54AA \nof the Code.\nThe X Bonds have a principal amount of $A and a final maturity date of Date 3.  \nThe X Bonds bear interest during the initial rate period at B% per annum.  The initial \nrate period is a term rate period that ends on Date 4.  The Y Bonds have a principal \namount of $C and a final maturity date of Date 3.  They bear interest during the initial \nrate period at D% per annum.  The initial rate period is a term rate period that ends on \nDate 5.  Taxpayer has the option to terminate the initial rate periods prior to Date 4 or \nDate 5, as the case may be.\nThe interest rate setting provisions of the X Bonds and the Y Bonds are identical.  \nAt the end of each interest rate period, including the initial rate period, Taxpayer can \ncontinue the same rate period, change to a new rate period as specified in the terms of \nthe Bonds, or redeem the Bonds.  More specifically, the Bonds are subject to optional \nredemption at the end of each interest rate period.  On any optional redemption date, \nTaxpayer may designate a new interest rate period.  The interest rate periods that may \nbe designated are a daily rate period, a weekly rate period, a term rate period, and a \nflexible rate period.\nFor Bonds in a daily rate period, a weekly rate period, or a term rate period, such \nperiod remains in effect unless and until the Bonds are redeemed or the option to \nchange interest rate periods is exercised.  For Bonds in a flexible rate period, the \nflexible segment is set by a remarketing agent at the end of the immediately preceding \nflexible segment.  For all Bonds, at the beginning of each interest rate period after the \ninitial rate period, the interest rate is set by the remarketing agent as the lowest rate \nwhich would enable the remarketing agent to sell such Bonds for delivery on the \nPLR-121254-11\n3\neffective date of such period at a price (without regard to accrued interest) equal to \n100% of the principal amount thereof, but in no event higher than the maximum rate \n(E% per annum).\nThe Bonds shall be subject to mandatory tender by holders on any date when the \noption to change interest rate periods is exercised, at the end of any term rate period or \nflexible segment, and on certain other dates.  Bonds tendered and not redeemed are \nremarketed by the remarketing agent.\nAt the end of the initial rate period for the X Bonds and the Y Bonds, Taxpayer \nintends to set a new term rate period which may be equal to the time until the final \nstated maturities of the respective Bonds, or a shorter period, pursuant to the terms of \nthe respective Bonds.  \nLAW AND ANALYSIS\nSection 1001 of the Code provides for the recognition of gain or loss on the sale \nor exchange of property.  Section 1.1001-1(a) of the Income Tax Regulations (the \n\u201cRegulations\u201d) provides that gain or loss is realized from the exchange of property for \nother property differing materially either in kind or in extent.\nSection 1.1001-3(b) provides that a debt instrument differs materially in kind or in \nextent if it has undergone a \u201csignificant modification.\u201d  A significant modification of a \ndebt instrument results in a \u201cnew\u201d debt instrument that is deemed to be exchanged for \nthe unmodified debt instrument.\nSection 1.1001-3(c) provides rules for determining whether a change in the legal \nrights or obligations of a debt instrument is a modification.  Pursuant to section 1.1001-\n3(c)(1)(i), a modification means any alteration, including any deletion or addition, in \nwhole or in part, of a legal right or obligation of the issuer or a holder of a debt \ninstrument, whether the alteration is evidenced by an express agreement (oral or \nwritten), conduct of the parties, or otherwise.\nSection 1.1001-3(c)(1)(ii) provides that an alteration of a legal right or obligation \nthat occurs by operation of the terms of a debt instrument is not a modification.  Section \n1.1001-3(c)(2)(iii) provides that an alteration that results from the exercise of an option \nprovided to an issuer or a holder to change a term of a debt instrument is a modification, \neven if the alteration occurs by operation of the terms of a debt instrument, unless the \noption is unilateral.\nPLR-121254-11\n4\nSection 1.1001-3(c)(3) provides that an option is unilateral only if, under the \nterms of an instrument or under applicable law, (i) there does not exist at the time the \noption is exercised, or as a result of the exercise, a right of the other party to alter or \nterminate the instrument or put the instrument to a person who is related to the issuer; \n(ii) the exercise of the option does not require the consent or the approval of the other \nparty, a related party, or a court or arbitrator; and (iii) the exercise of the option does not \nrequire consideration, except as further described therein.\nSection 1.1001-3(e) provides rules for determining whether a modification is \nsignificant.\nThe terms of the Bonds provide Taxpayer with the option to change interest rate \nperiods and, if that option is exercised by Taxpayer, the Bonds shall be subject to \nmandatory tender by holders. The mandatory tender is not a right of the holders to alter \nor terminate the Bonds under section 1.1001-3(c)(3)(i).  As a result, the Taxpayer\u2019s \noption to change interest rate periods is unilateral and the exercise of that option by \nTaxpayer is not a modification for purposes of section 1.1001-3.  \nCONCLUSION\nBased on the facts and representations submitted by the Taxpayer, we conclude \nthat the conversion of the Bonds to a new term rate period (or to one of the other \ninterest rate periods provided for under the terms of the Bonds) and the setting of a new \ninterest rate upon such conversion, all pursuant to the terms of the Bonds, will not result \nin a modification of the Bonds for purposes of section 1.1001-3.\nThis ruling is directed only to the taxpayer requesting it.  Section 6110(k)(3) of \nthe Code provides that it may not be used or cited as precedent.  A copy of this letter \nmust be attached to any income tax return to which it is relevant.\nPLR-121254-11\n5\nIn accordance with the Power of Attorney on file with this office, a copy of this letter is \nbeing sent to your authorized representatives.\nSincerely,\nDiana Imholtz\nDiana Imholtz\nChief, Branch 1\nOffice of Associate Chief Counsel\n(Financial Institutions and Products)\nEnclosures: Copy of this letter\nCopy for section 6110 purposes\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Non-Adverse"}]}

You requested a ruling that following the proposed transaction described \nbelow, Taxpayer\u2019s allocable share of rents from Building will be disregarded from \nTaxpayer\u2019s gross income to the extent that it does not exceed Taxpayer\u2019s allocable \nshare of LP\u2019s deductions for Building lease payments, for purposes of determining \nTaxpayer\u2019s gross income under the income tests of sections 856(c)(2) and (c)(3) of the \nInternal Revenue Code. \n \nFacts: \n \nPLR-132566-06 \n \n \n2 \n \n \nTaxpayer is a State A real estate investment trust (REIT) that has elected under \nsection 856(c) to be treated as a REIT for federal income tax purposes.  Taxpayer is the \nmanaging general partner of LP and owns approximately a percent of the outstanding \ncommon units of LP.  LP owns and operates numerous real properties throughout the \nUnited States through business entities classified as partnerships or disregarded \nentities for federal income tax purposes.   \n \n \nLLC, a limited liability company that is unrelated to Taxpayer or LP, owns the \nBuilding and leases it to LP.  LP operates the Building and leases commercial office \nspace in the Building to tenants that are also unrelated to Taxpayer or LP.  LP pays rent \nto LLC that is funded by rents that LP receives from the commercial tenants to whom it \nleases space.  The rents collected by LP from the commercial tenants annually exceed \nthe rent that LP pays to LLC for the Building.   \n \n \nLP holds an option to purchase a b percent interest in LLC and proposes to \nexercise that option.  Following the exercise of the option, LP will continue to pay rent \non the Building to LLC (that is funded through rents received from the commercial \ntenants), but as a member of LLC will be entitled to receive its allocable share of the \nBuilding rent. \n \nLaw and Analysis: \n \n \nSection 856(c)(2) provides that at least 95 percent of a REIT's gross income \nmust be derived from, among other sources, \"rents from real property.\" \n \n \nSection 856(c)(3) provides that at least 75 percent of a REIT's gross income \nmust be derived from, among other sources, \"rents from real property.\"  \n \n \nSection 856(d)(1) provides that \"rents from real property\" include (subject to \nexclusions provided in ' 856(d)(2)): (A) rents from interests in real property; (B) charges \nfor services customarily furnished or rendered in connection with the rental of real \nproperty, whether or not such charges are separately stated; and (C) rent attributable to \npersonal property leased under, or in connection with, a lease of real property, but only \nif the rent attributable to the personal property for the taxable year does not exceed 15 \npercent of the total rent for the tax year attributable to both the real and personal \nproperty leased under, or in connection with, the lease. \n \n \nSection 1.856-3(g) of the Income Tax regulations provides that a REIT that is a \npartner in a partnership is deemed (1) to own its proportionate share of each of the \nassets of the partnership and (2) to be entitled to the income of the partnership \nattributable to that share.  For purposes of section 856, the partner\u2019s interest in the \npartnership\u2019s assets is determined in accordance with the partner\u2019s capital interest in \nthe partnership. \n \nPLR-132566-06 \n \n \n3 \n \nUpon exercise of the option, Taxpayer will be entitled to an allocable share of the \nincome derived by LP from LP\u2019s interest in LLC.  To the extent that LP\u2019s gross income \nas a member of LLC is derived from the income paid by LP out of rents from \ncommercial tenants of the Building, LP\u2019s income may be double counted because it  \ndirectly earns gross income from the commercial tenants of the Building which is used \nby LP to pay the Building rent to LLC.  Thus, pursuant to section 1.856-3(g), Taxpayer \nwould be treated as earning the same gross income twice.   \n \nAccordingly, for purposes of determining Taxpayer\u2019s gross income for purposes \nof the income tests under sections 856(c)(2) and (c)(3), Taxpayer\u2019s allocable share of \ngross income from the Building will be disregarded as an item of gross income to the \nextent of Taxpayer\u2019s share of LP\u2019s deductions for rents paid on the Building to LLC. \n \n \nExcept as specifically ruled upon above, no opinion is expressed concerning any \nfederal income tax consequences relating to the facts herein under any other provision \nof the Code.  Specifically, we do not rule whether Taxpayer otherwise qualifies as a \nREIT under part II of subchapter M of Chapter 1 of the Code. \n \nThis ruling is directed only to the taxpayer requesting it.  Taxpayer should attach \na copy of this ruling to each tax return to which it applies.  Section 6110(k)(3) of the \nCode provides that this ruling may not be used or cited as precedent.          \n     \nSincerely, \n \nWilliam E. Coppersmith \nWilliam E.

The Taxpayer is a holding company.  Subsidiary is a\nregulated public utility within the meaning of \u00a7 7701(a)(33) and is in the business of\ngenerating, transmitting, and distributing electric power in State X and other states.  The\nmembers of the Taxpayer affiliated group file a consolidated federal income tax return\non a calendar year basis using the accrual method of accounting.  The Taxpayer\naffiliated group is subject to the audit jurisdiction of the District Director for the District.\nSubsidiary provides electrical services including distribution services to\ncustomers in its service territory.  A limited number of large customers, including the\narmy installations consisting of the Government, maintain their own distribution\nsystems.  They purchase power from the local utility and then distribute the power\nwithin their facilities.  The local utility provides power to a master metering point where\nthe customer takes title and responsibility for the electrical energy.\nThe Taxpayer represents that the government\u2019s master metering service\narrangement evolved for a number of reasons.  When first operational, many of the\ninstallations were located in rural or remote areas that did not yet have extensive local\npublic utility distribution infrastructures.  The army\u2019s ownership of the systems was\nneeded to assure the provision of safe and reliable utility services to meet an\ninstallation\u2019s important national defense requirements.  Many of the installations were\neither opened or greatly expanded during or just after World War II and then expanded\nagain during the early years of the Cold War.  According to the Taxpayer, during these\nsensitive times, government ownership of utility distribution systems was preferred in\norder to reduce an installation\u2019s vulnerability to sabotage and other threats.\nThe rationale for continued government ownership of utility systems changed in\nthe 1990s due to a combination of a changing defense mission with the end of the Cold\nWar and limited financial and other resources.  According to the Taxpayer, the\nconsequences of government ownership of utility distribution systems were the habitual\nunder funding of operation and maintenance requirements, difficulty in obtaining\nequipment, repair parts for specialized equipment not being stocked, and difficulty in\nfinding skilled staff.  Deferred system maintenance created a risk to the military\u2019s\nmission and to the public safety.\nIn a, the Department of the Army decided that ownership and operation of the\nutility systems should be privatized.  The army describes privatization as the transfer of\nownership, operation and maintenance, and system upgrade responsibilities to the non-\nfederal sector.  Because ownership of utility systems is not a core function of the army,\nPLR-119320-98\n-3-\ntransferring utility distribution system ownership to the non-federal sector would secure\nthe financial and other resources necessary to upgrade and properly maintain the\nsystems.  Related efficiencies were expected to result in cost savings and improved\nreliability.\nIn b, the Department of Defense announced a program of privatization reform. \nThe Defense Reform Initiative calls for the privatization by c of all electric, natural gas,\nwater, and wastewater utility systems, except those need for unique security reasons or\nwhen privatization is not economical.  The Department of Defense obtained statutory\napproval for its privatization policy.\nSection 2688(a) of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1998\n(the \u201cAct\u201d) provides that the Secretary of a military department may convey a utility\nsystem, or part of a utility system, under the jurisdiction of the Secretary to a municipal,\nprivate, regional, district, or cooperative utility company or other entity.  The conveyance\nmay consist of all right, title, and interest of the United States in the utility system or\nsuch lesser estate as the Secretary considered appropriate to serve the interests of the\nUnited States.\nSection 2688(c)(1) of the Act provides that the Secretary concerned shall require\nas consideration for a conveyance under section 2688(a) an amount equal to the fair\nmarket value (as determined by the Secretary) of the right, title, or interest of the United\nStates conveyed.  The consideration may take the form of (A) a lump sum payment; or\n(B) a reduction in charges for utility services provided by the utility or entity concerned\nto the military installation at which the utility system is located.\nSection 2688(e)(1) of the Act provides that the Secretary concerned may not\nmake a conveyance under section 2688(a) until the Secretary submits to the\nCommittee on Armed Services and the Committee on Appropriations of the Senate and\nthe Committee on National Security and the Committee on Appropriations of the House\nof Representatives an economic analysis (based upon accepted life-cycle costing\nprocedures approved by the Secretary of Defense) demonstrating that (A) the long-term\neconomic benefit of the conveyance to the United States exceeds the long-term\neconomic cost of the conveyance to the United States; and (B) the conveyance will\nreduce the long-term costs of the United States for utility services provided by the utility\nsystem concerned.\nThe army installations consisting of the Government own, operate, and maintain\nelectrical distributions systems.  The Government purchases electricity for these\ninstallations from Subsidiary.  The installations are all located in State X and within\nSubsidiary\u2019s service territory.\nThe army is pursuing privatization of its electric installations to comply with the\nDefense Reform Initiative.  Because additional base realignment and closure initiatives\nPLR-119320-98\n-4-\nmay occur, the cost of utility services are a factor in determining the mission of the\nbases and which bases will remain operational.  The army installations consisting of the\nGovernment are considered vital to the economies of the surrounding areas.  The\nTaxpayer emphasizes that privatization is viewed as providing for the public safety\nwithin the installations.  Under funding of maintenance has posed a hazard to the\npublic.  The Taxpayer asserts that public safety was a major impetus for privatization\nparticularly after ineffective maintenance at one installation caused a natural gas\nexplosion.\nPursuant to the Defense Reform Initiative and the Act, the army will transfer\nownership of the army installations consisting of the Government electrical distribution\nsystems facilities to Subsidiary for the nominal price of $d.  Subsidiary will assume\nresponsibility for operating the systems by distributing electricity to each of the buildings\non the Government installations.  Subsidiary would continue to provide for electric\ncommodity sales to a single master-metered delivery point.  The Taxpayer represents\nthat there would be no change in the nature, price, or volume of electrical services\nprovided to the Government installations.  Subsidiary will not include the contributed\nfacilities in its rate base.  Subsidiary will recover its ongoing cost to provide electrical\ndistribution services to the Government installations pursuant to a special service\nagreement.\nThe Taxpayer requests a ruling that the transfers of electrical distribution\nsystems and other amounts by the Government to Subsidiary under a program to\nprivatize electrical distribution systems represent contributions to capital of Subsidiary\nunder \u00a7 118(a) and are not contributions in aid of construction (\u201cCIAC\u201d) under \u00a7 118(b)\nof the Code.\nSection 118(a) provides that in the case of a corporation, gross income does not\ninclude any contribution to the capital of the taxpayer.  Section 118(b) provides that for\npurposes of \u00a7 118(a), except as provided in \u00a7 118(c), the term \u201ccontribution to the\ncapital of taxpayer\u201d does not include any CIAC or any other contribution as a customer\nor potential customer.\nSection 1.118-1 of the Income Tax Regulations provides, in part, that \u00a7 118 also\napplies to contributions to capital made by persons other than shareholders.  For\nexample, the exclusion applies to the value of land or other property contributed to a\ncorporation by a governmental unit or by a civic group for the purpose of enabling the\ncorporation to expand its operating facilities.  However, the exclusion does not apply to\nany money or property transferred to the corporation in consideration for goods or\nservices rendered, or to subsidies paid to induce the taxpayer to limit production.\nThe legislative history to \u00a7 118 states that the exclusion from gross income for\nnonshareholder contributions to capital of a corporation was intended to apply to those\ncontributions that are neither gifts, because the contributor expects to derive indirect\nPLR-119320-98\n-5-\nbenefits, nor payments for future services, because the anticipated future benefits are\ntoo intangible.  The legislative history also states that the provision was intended to\ncodify the existing law that had developed through administrative and court decisions\non the subject.  H.R. Rep. No. 1337, 83rd Cong., 2d Sess. 17 (1954); S. Rep. No. 1622,\n83d Cong., 2d Sess. 18-19 (1954).\nIn general, the amendment made by \u00a7 824 of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 (the\n\u201c1986 Act\u201d) to \u00a7 118 was intended to require a regulated public utility to include in\nincome the value of any CIAC made to encourage the provision of services by the utility\nto a customer.  As a result under the 1986 Act, all CIACs, even those received by a\nregulated public utility such as Subsidiary, are includible in the gross income of the\nreceiving corporation.  The House Ways and Means Committee Report (the \u201cHouse\nReport\u201d) states that property, including money, is a CIAC, rather than a contribution to\ncapital, if it is contributed to provide or encourage the provision of services to or for the\nbenefit of the person making the contribution.  H.R. Rep. No. 426, 99th Cong., 1st. Sess.\n644 (1985); 1986-3 (Vol. 2) C.B. 644.\nA utility is considered as having received property to encourage the provision of\nservices if any one of the following conditions are met: (1) the receipt of the property is\na prerequisite to the provision of the services; (2) the receipt of the property results in\nthe provision of services earlier than would have been the case had the property not\nbeen received; or (3) the receipt of the property otherwise causes the transferor to be\nfavored in any way.  The House Report also states that the repeal of the special\nexclusion does not affect transfers of property that are not made for the provision of\nservices, including situations where it is clearly shown that the benefit of the public as a\nwhole was the primary motivating factor in the transfers.  House Report at 644-45;\n1986-3 (Vol. 2) C.B. at 644-45.\nNotice 87-82, 1987-2 C.B. 389, provides additional guidance on the treatment of\nCIACs.  Notice 87-82 follows the language from the House Report and states that a\npayment received by a utility that does not reasonably relate to the provision of services\nby the utility or for the benefit of the person making the payment, but rather relates to\nthe benefit of the public at large, is not a CIAC.  In Notice 87-82, an example of a\npayment benefitting the public at large is a relocation payment received by a utility\nunder a government program to place utility lines underground.  In that situation, the\nrelocation is undertaken for either reasons of community aesthetics or in the interest of\npublic safety and does not directly benefit particular customers of the utility.\nThe Taxpayer argues that the proposed transfers of the Government electrical\ndistribution systems to Subsidiary should not be treated as CIACs under \u00a7 118(b)\nbecause the transfers are not a prerequisite to the provision of services; the army is\nalready receiving electrical services from Subsidiary.  The transfers will not cause the\narmy to be favored in any way because Subsidiary does not anticipate an increase in\nelectric commodity sales attributable to the transfers.  The Taxpayer concludes that the\nPLR-119320-98\n-6-\nHouse Report and Notice 87-82 stand for the proposition that transfers which do not\nresult in new or expanded utility services are not CIACs under \u00a7 118(b).\nThe Taxpayer also strongly contends that the proposed transfers will benefit the\npublic at large because the primary motive for the transfers is for public safety.  The\narmy is making the transfers because it lacks the resources to properly operate the\nGovernment distribution systems without creating a risk to the army, contractor\npersonnel, and the general public that routinely visit the Government installations.  The\nTaxpayer has enumerated instances were the under funding of operation and\nmaintenance costs have created hazardous conditions.  The Taxpayer concludes that\nthe proposed transfers are not CIACs because the transfers satisfy the public benefit\nexception contained in the House Report and Notice 87-82.\nIn order for the proposed transfers not to be treated as CIACs under \u00a7 118(b),\nthe army must not be receiving new or expanded utility services and the transfer by the\narmy must satisfy the public benefit exception contained in the House Report and\nNotice 87-82.  We do not agree with the Taxpayer that the army will not be receiving\nnew or expanded utility services from Subsidiary.  The army is a customer of Subsidiary\nthat is making contributions to Subsidiary in its capacity as a customer.  Though\nSubsidiary will not provide increased electric commodity sales to the army for the\nGovernment installations, Subsidiary will be providing new and expanded electrical\ndistribution services on the installations, for which it will receive separate compensation\nunder a special service agreement.  In addition, we do not agree with the Taxpayer that\nthe proposed transfers satisfy the public benefit exception.\nThe Taxpayer and the army have provided numerous examples where the under\nfunding of operation and maintenance have created safety problems on army\ninstallations.  However, section 2688(e)(1) of the Act clearly demonstrates that\nCongress intended that the privatization must be for the long-term economic benefit of\nthe United States which is defined as reducing long-term costs to the United States for\nutility services.  The Taxpayer has been unable to find any authority in the legislative\nhistory of the Act demonstrating that the Congress\u2019 primary motive in enacting the Act\nwas safety concerns, not economic benefits to the United States.  It appears that the\narmy had the choice of spending more money for operation and maintenance, or\ncontracting with Subsidiary for those services.  Subsidiary may perform those services\nmore efficiently with or without owning the distribution systems.  However, the army is\nmaking the contributions in its capacity as a customer and will be receiving Subsidiary\u2019s\ndistribution services.\n  \nAccordingly, based on the representations of the Taxpayer, we rule that the\nproposed transfers of the Government electrical distribution systems to the Subsidiary\nare CIACs under \u00a7 118(b).  Therefore, the contributions of the Government electrical\ndistribution systems do not qualify as nonshareholder contributions to capital to\nSubsidiary under \u00a7 118(a).\nPLR-119320-98\n-7-\nExcept as specifically set forth above, no opinion is expressed or implied\nconcerning the federal income tax consequences of the above described facts under\nany other provision of the Code or regulations.\nThis ruling is directed only to the taxpayer who requested it.

Two independent trustees are the trustees (Trustees) of Trust.  During \nGrantor\u2019s lifetime, the beneficiaries of Trust are Grantor and his siblings.  However, if \nGrantor\u2019s siblings are not living, the class of permissible beneficiaries will include \nGrantor\u2019s parents.  \nTrustees must make distributions of income and principal as directed by \nDistribution Committee and/or Grantor, as follows:  \n(1)  At any time, Trustees, pursuant to the direction of a majority of Distribution \nCommittee, with the written consent of Grantor, shall distribute to Grantor or the \nbeneficiaries such amounts of the net income or principal as directed by Distribution \nCommittee (Grantor\u2019s Consent Power);\nPLR-134672-13\n2\n(2)  At any time, Trustees, pursuant to the direction of all Distribution Committee \nmembers, other than Grantor, shall distribute to the beneficiaries such amounts of the \nnet income or principal as directed by Distribution Committee (Unanimous Member \nPower); and\n(3)  At any time, Grantor, in a nonfiduciary capacity, may, but shall not be \nrequired to, distribute to any one or more of the beneficiaries other than himself, such \namounts of the principal (including the whole thereof) as Grantor deems advisable to \nprovide for the health, maintenance, support and education of Grantor\u2019s issue (Grantor\u2019s \nSole Power).  \nThe Distribution Committee may direct that distributions be made equally or \nunequally and to or for the benefit of any one or more of the beneficiaries of Trust to the \nexclusion of others.  Any net income not distributed by Trustee will be accumulated and \nadded to principal.  Distribution Committee will be initially composed of Grantor, \nGrantor\u2019s siblings and Grantor\u2019s nephews and will cease to exist upon Grantor\u2019s death.\nTrust provides that at all times the Distribution Committee must consist of at least \ntwo adults (other than Grantor) either (1) who are members of the class of persons \neligible to receive distributions of income or principal under Trust or (2) if there are not \ntwo adult members of such class who are willing and able to serve, who are the parent \nor guardian of a member of such class of eligible distributes (Eligible Individuals).  If at \nany time fewer than two Eligible Individuals are members, the Distribution Committee \nshall be deemed not to exist. \nA vacancy on Distribution Committee must be filled in the following order: (1) the \noldest of the Grantor\u2019s adult issue who willing to serve and is not already serving as a \nmember of Distribution Committee; (2) the oldest of the adult issue of Grantor\u2019s parents \nwho is willing to serve and who is not already serving as a member of Distribution \nCommittee; (3) the legal guardian, if any, or the parent of the oldest of the Grantor\u2019s \nminor issue who is not already serving as a member of Distribution Committee; (4) the \nlegal guardian, if any, or the parent of the oldest minor issue of Grantor\u2019s parents who is \nwilling to serve and is not already serving as a member of Distribution Committee; (5) \nGrantor\u2019s father; or (6) Grantor\u2019s mother.  If at any time Distribution Committee does not \ninclude at least two members, Distribution Committee shall be deemed not to exist. The \nDistribution Committee will cease to exist upon Grantor\u2019s death. \nUpon Grantor\u2019s death, the Trustee will dispose of the then-remaining principal \nand undistributed income of Trust as Grantor directs by a will specifically referring to this \npower of appointment (the Testamentary Power), provided that no such appointment \nmay be made to Grantor\u2019s estate, Grantor\u2019s creditors, or the creditors of Grantor\u2019s \nestate. Grantor\u2019s power includes the power to appoint outright or in trust and to create \nnew powers.  In default of the exercise of Grantor\u2019s Testamentary Power, the balance of \nTrust will be distributed, per stirpes, to Grantor\u2019s then living issue in further trust.  If none \nPLR-134672-13\n3\nof Grantor\u2019s issue is then living, but any descendant of Grantor\u2019s parents is then living, \nTrustees are to allocate income and principal per stirpes among Grantor\u2019s parents issue \nin further trust.  If no descendant of Grantor\u2019s parents is then living, Trustees are to \ndistribute the remaining income and principal pursuant to State law as if Grantor had \ndied intestate and unmarried. \nYou have requested the following rulings:\n           1. During the period Distribution Committee is serving, no portion of the items of \nincome, deductions and credits against tax of the Trust will be included in computing the \ntaxable income, deductions and credits of the Grantor under \u00a7 671.\n2. The contribution of property to Trust by Grantor will not be a completed gift \nsubject to federal gift tax. \n3. Any distribution of property by the Distribution Committee from Trust to \nGrantor will not be a completed gift, subject to Federal gift tax, by any member of the \nDistribution Committee.\n4.  Any distribution of property by Distribution Committee from Trust to any \nbeneficiary of Trust, other than Grantor, will not be a completed gift subject to federal \ngift tax, by any member of the Distribution Committee, other than Grantor.\nRuling 1\nSection 671 provides that where it is specified in subpart E of Part I of \nsubchapter J that the grantor or another person shall be treated as the owner of any \nportion of a trust, there shall then be included in computing the taxable income and \ncredits of the grantor or the other person those items of income, deductions, and credits \nagainst tax of the trust which are attributable to that portion of the trust to the extent that \nsuch items would be taken into account under chapter 1 in computing taxable income or \ncredits against the tax of an individual.\nSection 672(a) provides that, for purposes of subpart E, the term \u201cadverse party\u201d \nmeans any person having a substantial beneficial interest in the trust which would be \nadversely affected by the exercise or nonexercise of the power which he possesses \nrespecting the trust.\nSections 673 through 677 specify the circumstances under which the grantor is \ntreated as the owner of a portion of a trust.\nSection 673(a) provides that the grantor shall be treated as the owner of any \nportion of a trust in which the grantor has a reversionary interest in either the corpus or \nthe income therefrom, if, as of the inception of that portion of the trust, the value of such \nPLR-134672-13\n4\ninterest exceeds 5 percent of the value of such portion.\nSection 674(a) provides, in general, that the grantor shall be treated as the owner \nof any portion of a trust in respect of which the beneficial enjoyment of the corpus or the \nincome therefrom is subject to a power of disposition, exercisable by the grantor or a \nnonadverse party, or both, without the approval or consent of any adverse party.\nSection 674(b) provides that \u00a7 674(a) shall not apply to the power in \u00a7 674(b)(5) \nregardless of by whom held. Section 674(b)(5)(A) describes a power to distribute corpus \nto or for a beneficiary provided that the power is limited by a reasonably definite \nstandard which is set forth in the trust instrument.\nSection 674(b)(3) provides that \u00a7 674(a) shall not apply to a power exercisable \nonly by will, other than a power in the grantor to appoint by will the income of the trust \nwhere the income is accumulated for such disposition by the grantor or may be so \naccumulated in the discretion of the grantor or a nonadverse party, or both, without the \napproval or consent of any adverse party.\nUnder \u00a7 675 and applicable regulations, the grantor is treated as the owner of \nany portion of a trust if, under the terms of the trust agreement or circumstances \nattendant to its operation, administrative control is exercisable primarily for the benefit of \nthe grantor rather than the beneficiary of the trust.\nSection 676(a) provides that the grantor shall be treated as the owner of any \nportion of a trust, whether or not he is treated as such owner under any other provision \nof part I, subchapter J, chapter 1, where at any time the power to re-vest in the grantor \ntitle to such portion is exercisable by the grantor or a nonadverse party, or both.\nSection 677(a) provides, in general, that the grantor shall be treated as the owner \nof any portion of a trust, whether or not he is treated as such owner under \u00a7 674, whose \nincome without the approval or consent of any adverse party is, or, in the discretion of \nthe grantor or a nonadverse party, or both, may be (1) distributed to the grantor or the \ngrantor\u2019s spouse; (2) held or accumulated for future distribution to the grantor or the \ngrantor\u2019s spouse; or (3) applied to the payment of premiums on policies of insurance on\nthe life of the grantor or the grantor\u2019s spouse.\nSection 678(a) provides that a person other than the grantor shall be treated as \nthe owner of any portion of a trust with respect to which: (1) such person has a power \nexercisable solely by himself to vest the corpus or the income therefrom in himself, or \n(2) such person has previously partially released or otherwise modified such a power \nand after the release or modification retains such control as would, within the principles \nof \u00a7\u00a7 671-677, inclusive, subject a grantor of a trust to treatment as the owner thereof.\nBased solely on the facts submitted and representations made, we conclude an \nPLR-134672-13\n5\nexamination of Trust reveals none of the circumstances that would cause Grantor to be \ntreated as the owner of any portion of Trust under \u00a7\u00a7 673, 674, 676, or 677. Because \nnone of the other Distribution Committee members has a power exercisable solely by \nhimself to vest Trust income or corpus in himself, none shall be treated as the owner of \nany portion of the Trust under \u00a7 678(a).\nWe further conclude that an examination of Trust reveals none of the \ncircumstances that would cause administrative controls to be considered exercisable \nprimarily for the benefit of Grantor under \u00a7 675. Thus, the circumstances attendant on \nthe operation of Trust will determine whether Grantor will be treated as the owner of any \nportion of Trust under \u00a7 675. This is a question of fact, the determination of which must \nbe deferred until the federal income tax returns of the parties involved have been \nexamined by the office with responsibility for such examination.\nRulings 2 and 3\n                    Section 2501(a)(1) provides that a tax is imposed for each calendar year on the \ntransfer of property by gift during such calendar year by any individual, resident or \nnonresident.  Section 2511(a) provides that the tax imposed by \u00a7 2501 applies whether \nthe transfer is in trust or otherwise, whether the gift is direct or indirect, and whether the \nproperty is real or personal, tangible or intangible.\n   \n                    Section 25.2511-2(b) of the Gift Tax Regulations provides that a gift is complete \nas to any property, or part thereof or interest therein, of which the donor has so parted \nwith dominion and control as to leave in the donor no power to change its disposition, \nwhether for the donor\u2019s own benefit or for the benefit of another.  But if upon a transfer \nof property (whether in trust or otherwise) the donor reserves any power over its \ndisposition, the gift may be wholly incomplete, or may be partially complete and partially \nincomplete, depending upon all the facts in the particular case.  Accordingly, in every \ncase of a transfer of property subject to a reserved power, the terms of the power must \nbe examined and its scope determined.\n         Section 25.2511-2(b) also provides an example where the donor transfers \nproperty to another in trust to pay the income to the donor or accumulate it in the \ndiscretion of the trustee, and the donor retains a testamentary power to appoint the \nremainder among the donor\u2019s descendants.  The regulation concludes that no portion of \nthe transfer is a completed gift.  However, if the donor had not retained a testamentary \npower of appointment, but instead provided that the remainder should go to X or his \nheirs, the entire transfer would be a completed gift.\n         Section 25.2511-2(c) provides that a gift is incomplete in every instance in which a \ndonor reserves the power to re-vest the beneficial title in himself or herself.  A gift is also \nincomplete if and to the extent that a reserved power gives the donor the power to name \nPLR-134672-13\n6\nnew beneficiaries or to change the interests of the beneficiaries as between themselves \nunless the power is a fiduciary power limited by a fixed or ascertainable standard.  \n         Section 25.2511-2(e) provides that a donor is considered as himself having a \npower if it is exercisable by him in conjunction with any person not having a substantial \nadverse interest in the disposition of the transferred property or the income therefrom.  \n         Section 25.2511-2(f) provides that the relinquishment or termination of a power to \nchange the beneficiaries of transferred property, occurring otherwise than by death of \nthe donor, is regarded as the event which completes the gift and causes the gift tax to \napply.\n       \n         Section 25.2511-2(g) provides that if a donor transfers property to himself as \ntrustee (or to himself and some other person, not possessing a substantial adverse \ninterest, as trustees), and retains no beneficial interest in the trust property and no \npower over it except fiduciary powers, the exercise or nonexercise of which is limited by \na fixed or ascertainable standard, to change the beneficiaries of the transferred \nproperty, the donor has made a completed gift and the entire value of the transferred \nproperty is subject to the gift tax.  \nSection 25.2511-2(e) does not define \u201csubstantial adverse interest.\u201d  Section \n25.2514-3(b)(2) provides, in part, that a taker in default of appointment under a power \nhas an interest that is adverse to an exercise of the power.  Section 25.2514-3(b)(2) \nalso provides that a coholder of a power is considered as having an adverse interest \nwhere he may possess the power after the possessor\u2019s death and may exercise it at \nthat time in favor of himself, his estate, his creditors, or the creditors of his estate.  \n         In Estate of Sanford v. Commissioner, 308 U.S. 39 (1939), the taxpayer created a \ntrust for the benefit of named beneficiaries and reserved the power to revoke the trust in \nwhole or in part, and to designate new beneficiaries other than himself.  Six years later, \nin 1919, the taxpayer relinquished the power to revoke the trust, but retained the right to \nchange the beneficiaries. In 1924, the taxpayer relinquished the right to change the \nbeneficiaries.  The Court stated that the taxpayer\u2019s gift is not complete, for purposes of \nthe gift tax, when the donor has reserved the power to determine those others who \nwould ultimately receive the property.  Accordingly, the Court held that the taxpayer\u2019s \ngift was complete in 1924, when he relinquished his right to change the beneficiaries of \nthe trust.  A grantor\u2019s retention of a power to change the beneficial interests in a trust \ncauses the transfer to the trust to be incomplete for gift tax purposes, even though the \npower may be defeated by the actions of third parties. Goldstein v. Commisisoner, 37 \nT.C. 897 (1962).  See also Estate of Goelet v. Commissioner, 51 T.C. 352 (1968).\nIn this case, Grantor retained the Grantor\u2019s Consent Power over the income and \nprincipal of Trust.  Under \u00a7 25.2511-2(e), a donor is considered as himself having a \npower if it is exercisable by him in conjunction with any person not having a substantial \nPLR-134672-13\n7\nadverse interest in the disposition of the transferred property or the income therefrom.  \nThe Distribution Committee members are not takers in default for purposes of                \n\u00a7 25.2514-3(b)(2).  They are merely co-holders of the power.  The Distribution \nCommittee ceases to exist upon the death of Grantor.  Under \u00a7 25.2514-3(b)(2), a co-\nholder of a power is only considered as having an adverse interest where he may \npossess the power after the possessor\u2019s death and may exercise it at that time in favor \nof himself, his estate, his creditors, or the creditors of his estate.  In this case, the \nDistribution Committee ceases to exist upon Grantor\u2019s death.  Accordingly, the \nDistribution Committee members do not have interests adverse to Grantor under           \n\u00a7 25.2514-3(b)(2) and for purposes of \u00a7 25.2511-2(e).  Therefore, Grantor is considered \nas possessing the power to distribute income and principal to any beneficiary himself \nbecause he retained the Grantor\u2019s Consent Power.  The retention of this power causes \nthe transfer of property to Trust to be wholly incomplete for federal gift tax purposes.\nGrantor also retained the Grantor\u2019s Sole Power over the principal of Trust.  Under \n\u00a7 25.2511-2(c), a gift is incomplete if and to the extent that a reserved power gives the \ndonor the power to name new beneficiaries or to change the interests of the \nbeneficiaries.  In this case, Grantor\u2019s Sole Power gives Grantor the power to change the \ninterests of the beneficiaries.  Accordingly, the retention of the Grantor\u2019s Sole Power \ncauses the transfer of property to Trust to be wholly incomplete for federal gift tax \npurposes.\nFurther, Grantor retained Grantor\u2019s Testamentary Power to appoint the property \nin Trust to anyone, including trusts, other than Grantor\u2019s estate, Grantor\u2019s creditors, or \nthe creditors of Grantor\u2019s estate.  Under \u00a7 25.2511-2(b) the retention of a testamentary \npower to appoint the remainder of a trust is considered a retention of dominion and \ncontrol over the remainder.  Accordingly, the retention of this power causes the transfer \nof property to Trust to be incomplete with respect to the remainder in Trust for federal \ngift tax purposes.\nFinally, the Distribution Committee possesses the Unanimous Member Power \nover income and principal.  This power is not a condition precedent to Grantor\u2019s powers.   \nGrantor\u2019s powers over the income and principal are presently exercisable and not \nsubject to a condition precedent.  Grantor retains dominion and control over the income \nand principal of Trust until the Distribution Committee members exercise their \nUnanimous Member Power.  Accordingly, this power does not cause the transfer of \nproperty to be complete for federal gift tax purposes  See Goldstein v. Commissioner, \n37 T.C. 897 (1962); Estate of Goelet v. Commissioner, 51 T.C. 352 (1968).   \nAccordingly, based on the facts submitted and the representations made, we \nconclude that the contribution of property to Trust by Grantor is not a completed gift \nsubject to federal gift tax.  Any distribution from Trust to Grantor is merely a return of \nGrantor\u2019s property.  Therefore, we conclude that any distribution of property by the \nDistribution Committee from Trust to Grantor will not be a completed gift subject to \nPLR-134672-13\n8\nfederal gift tax, by any member of the Distribution Committee.  Further, upon Grantor\u2019s \ndeath, the fair market value of the property in Trust is includible in Grantor\u2019s gross \nestate for federal estate tax purposes.\nRuling 4       \n               \nSection 2514(b) provides that the exercise or release of a general power of \nappointment created after October 21, 1942, shall be deemed a transfer of property by \nthe individual possessing such power.\n          Section 2514(c) provides that the term \u201cgeneral power of appointment\u201d means a \npower which is exercisable in favor of the individual possessing the power (possessor), \nthe possessor\u2019s estate, the possessor\u2019s creditors, or the creditors of the individual\u2019s \nestate.\n        Section 25.2514-1(c)(1) provides, in part, that a power of appointment is not a \ngeneral power if by its terms it is exercisable only in favor of one or more designated \npersons or classes other than the possessor or his creditors, or the possessor\u2019s estate \nor the creditors of the estate.\nSection 2514(c)(3)(A) provides, that in the case of a power of appointment \ncreated after October 21, 1942, if the power is exercisable by the possessor only in \nconjunction with the creator of the power, such power is not deemed a general power of \nappointment.\n         Section 2514(c)(3)(B) provides, that in the case of a power of appointment created \nafter October 21, 1942, if the power is not exercisable by the possessor except in \nconjunction with a person having a substantial interest in the property subject to the \npower, which is adverse to the exercise of the power in favor of the possessor, such \npower shall not be deemed a general power of appointment.  For purposes of                \n\u00a7 2514(c)(3)(b), a person who, after the death of the possessor, may be possessed of a \npower of appointment (with respect to the property subject to the possessor\u2019s power) \nwhich he may exercise in his own favor shall be deemed as having an interest in the \nproperty and such interest shall be deemed adverse to such exercise of the possessor\u2019s \npower.  \n          \n         Section 25.2514-3(b)(2) provides, in part, that a co-holder of a power has no \nadverse interest merely because of his joint possession of the power nor merely \nbecause he is a permissible appointee under a power.  However, a co-holder of a power \nis considered as having an adverse interest where he may possess the power after the \npossessor\u2019s death and may exercise it at that time in favor of himself, his estate, his \ncreditors, or the creditors of his estate.  Thus, for example, if X, Y, and Z held a power \njointly to appoint among a group of persons which includes themselves and if on the \ndeath of X the power will pass to Y and Z jointly, then Y and Z are considered to have \nPLR-134672-13\n9\ninterests adverse to the exercise of the power in favor of X.  Similarly, if on Y\u2019s death the \npower will pass to Z, Z is considered to have an interest adverse to the exercise of the \npower in favor of Y.  \n           The powers held by the Distribution Committee members under the Grantor\u2019s \nConsent Power are powers that are exercisable only in conjunction with the creator, \nGrantor.  Accordingly, under \u00a7 2514(c)(3)(A), the Distribution Committee members do \nnot possess general powers of appointment by virtue of possessing this power.  Further, \nthe powers held by the Distribution Committee members under the Unanimous Member \nPowers are not general powers of appointment.  As in the example in \u00a7 25.2514-3(b)(2), \nthe Distribution Committee members have substantial adverse interests in the property \nsubject to this power.  Accordingly, any distribution made from Trust to a beneficiary, \nother than Grantor, pursuant to the exercise of these powers, the Grantor\u2019s Consent \nPower and the Unanimous Member Powers, are not gifts by the Distribution Committee \nmembers.  Instead, such distributions are gifts by Grantor.  \nBased upon the facts submitted and representations made, we conclude that any \ndistribution of property by the Distribution Committee from Trust to any beneficiary of \nTrust, other than Grantor, will not be a completed gift subject to federal gift tax, by any \nmember of the Distribution Committee.  Further, we conclude that any distribution of \nproperty from Trust to a beneficiary, other than Grantor, will be a completed gift by \nGrantor.  \nExcept as specifically ruled herein, we express no opinion on the federal tax \nconsequences of the transaction under the cited provisions or under any other \nprovisions of the Code.  Specifically, we express no opinion on the trust provisions \npermitting Trustee to distribute income or principal to trustees of other qualified trusts \n(decanting).\nPLR-134672-13\n10\nThis ruling is directed only to the taxpayer that requested it.

Taxpayer will make \nan election to be treated as a real estate investment trust (REIT) for its first taxable year \nending on Date 1.  Taxpayer will adopt the calendar year for Federal income tax \nreporting and will use the accrual method as its overall method of accounting.\nTaxpayer was formed to invest in Property located at Address through one or \nmore entities treated as partnerships or disregarded entities for Federal income tax \npurposes.  Taxpayer will acquire an x% interest in Holding.  Holding will acquire a y% \ninterest in Fee Partnership and a y% interest in Leasehold Partnership.  Both Fee \nPartnership and Leasehold Partnership are entities organized under the laws of State B.  \nFee Partnership owns (through wholly owned subsidiaries, each of which is disregarded \nas an entity separate from Fee Partnership for Federal income tax purposes) the land \nunderlying Property.  Leasehold Partnership leases (through wholly owned subsidiaries, \neach of which is disregarded as an entity separate from Leasehold for Federal income \ntax purposes) the land underlying Property.\nAs a result of the ownership percentages, Taxpayer will own indirectly a z% \ninterest in each of Fee Partnership and Leasehold Partnership.  Through entities \ndisregarded for Federal income tax purposes, Fee Partnership leases the land to \nLeasehold Partnership pursuant to a ground lease, which requires payments of fixed \nrent and real estate taxes (collectively, \u201cGround Rents\u201d).  Through entities disregarded \nfor Federal income tax purposes, Leasehold Partnership leases Property to tenants that \nare unrelated to Taxpayer.\nLAW\nSection 856(c)(2) provides that at least 95 percent of a REIT\u2019s gross income \nmust be derived from, among other sources, rents from real property.\nPLR-129016-13\n3\nSection 856(c)(3) provides that at least 75 percent of a REIT\u2019s gross income \nmust be derived from, among other sources, rents from real property.\nSection 856(c)(4)(A) provides that at the close of each quarter of its tax year, at \nleast 75 percent of the value of a REIT\u2019s total assets must be represented by real estate \nassets, cash and cash items (including receivables), and Government securities.\nSection 856(c)(5)(J) provides, in relevant part, that to the extent necessary to \ncarry out the purposes of Part II of subchapter M of the Code, the Secretary is \nauthorized to determine, solely for purposes of such part, whether any item of income or \ngain which does not otherwise qualify under section 856(c)(2) or (3) may be considered \nas not constituting gross income for purposes of section 856(c)(2) or (3).\nSection 856(d)(2)(B)(ii) provides that for purposes of sections 856(c)(2) and (3), \nthe term \u201crents from real property\u201d does not include any amount received or accrued \ndirectly or indirectly from any person if the REIT owns, directly or indirectly, in the case \nof a person that is not a corporation, an interest of 10 percent or more in the assets or \nnet profits of such person.\nSection 856(d)(5) provides that, for purposes of section 856(d), the rules \nprescribed in section 318(a) apply with certain modifications to determine ownership of \nthe stock, assets, or net profits of any person.\nSection 1.856-3(g) of the Income Tax Regulations provides that a REIT that is a \npartner in a partnership is deemed to own its proportionate share of each of the assets \nof the partnership and to be entitled to the income of the partnership attributable to that \nshare.  For purposes of section 856, the interest of a partner in the partnership\u2019s assets \nis determined in accordance with the partner\u2019s capital interest in the partnership.  The \ncharacter of the various assets in the hands of the partnership and items of gross \nincome of the partnership retain the same character in the hands of the partnership for \nall purposes of section 856.\nANALYSIS\nTaxpayer will acquire an x% partnership interest in Holding, which owns a y% \npartnership interest in each of Fee Partnership and Leasehold Partnership.  Pursuant to \nsection 1.856-3(g), Taxpayer through Holding, will be allocated y% of the gross income \nderived by Leasehold Partnership from the rents paid by unrelated tenants in the \nProperty.  Taxpayer, through Holding, will be allocated the same percentage of the \ngross income derived by Fee Partnership from the rents paid by Leasehold Partnership.  \nFurther, Taxpayer, through Holding, will be allocated the same percentage of the \ndeduction attributable to Leasehold Partnership\u2019s payment of rents.  Because the only \nsource of income for Fee Partnership is the Ground Rents paid by Leasehold \nPartnership, Taxpayer\u2019s allocable share of income from Leasehold Partnership will be \nPLR-129016-13\n4\ndouble counted because it is already included in Taxpayer\u2019s allocable share of Fee \nPartnership\u2019s gross income for purposes of section 856(c).  Thus, pursuant to section \n1.856-3(g), Taxpayer would be treated as earning the same gross income twice.\nCONCLUSION\nBased on the facts and representations submitted by Taxpayer, for purposes of \ndetermining Taxpayer\u2019s gross income under sections 856(c)(2) and (3), Taxpayer\u2019s \nallocable share of Ground Rents paid from Leasehold Partnership to Fee Partnership \nwill be disregarded as an item of gross income to the extent that those amounts do not \nexceed Taxpayer\u2019s allocable share of Leasehold Partnership\u2019s deductions attributable to \nthe Ground Rents paid by Leasehold Partnership to Fee Partnership.\nExcept as expressly provided herein, no opinion is expressed or implied \nconcerning the tax consequences of any aspect of any transaction or item discussed or \nreferenced in this letter.  In particular, no opinion is expressed whether Taxpayer \notherwise qualifies as a REIT under part II of subchapter M of Chapter 1 of the Code.\nThis ruling is directed only to the taxpayer requesting it.

The rulings concern the interplay of the rules in \nsubchapter T of the Internal Revenue Code (concerning the taxation of cooperatives \nand their patrons) and the calculation of the section 199 deduction for certain \ncooperatives contained in section 199(d)(3). \nTaxpayer is a farmers\u2019 cooperative organized as a cooperative association under \nthe laws of State A.  Taxpayer is a grain marketing cooperative serving farmers located \nin Area.  \nFarmers in the Area principally raise wheat and barley.  During its fiscal year \nended -----------, 2010 (\u201c2010\u201d), Taxpayer\u2019s grain sales were approximately $------\nmillion.  In 2010, Taxpayer purchased approximately ---- million bushels of wheat and \nbarley from its members and others.  Taxpayer also sells seed to its members and \nothers.  In 2010, seed sales totaled approximately $---- million. \nTaxpayer\u2019s \u201cmembers\u201d are producers of grain who do business with it.  At ---------\n-----------, 2010, Taxpayer had ----- members.  \nPLR-100983-11\n2\nTaxpayer is organized and operated on a cooperative basis.  The State A \ncooperative association statute describes cooperative associations as being organized \n\u201cfor mutual welfare\u201d and the businesses of cooperatives as being operated \u201con the \ncooperative plan.\u201d  ---------------------.    \nMore specifically, the statute provides:\n\u201cThe directors may apportion the net earnings [of a cooperative \nassociation] by paying dividends upon the paid-up capital stock at a rate \nnot exceeding eight percent per annum.  They may set aside reasonable \nreserves out of such net earnings for any association purpose.  The \ndirectors may, however, distribute all or any portion of the net earnings to \nmembers in proportion to the business of each with the association and \nthey may include nonmembers at a rate not exceeding that paid to \nmembers.  The directors may distribute, on a patronage basis, such net \nearnings at different rates on different classes, kinds, or varieties of \nproducts handled.  All dividends declared or other distributions made \nunder this section may, in the discretion of the directors, be in the form of \ncapital stock, capital or equity certificates, book credits, or capital funds of \nthe association.  All unclaimed dividends or distributions authorized under \nthis chapter or funds payable on redeemed stock, equity certificates, book \ncredits, or capital funds shall revert to the association at the discretion of \nthe directors at any time after one year from the end of the fiscal year \nduring which such distributions or redemptions have been declared.\u201d  ------\n---------------------.\nTaxpayer\u2019s Articles of Incorporation authorize Taxpayer to engage in the grain \nbusiness for its members, to \u201cexercise generally the powers customarily exercised by \ncooperative associations\u201d and to do so \u201con a nonprofit cooperative basis as agent1 for \nits members.\u201d  Articles of Incorporation, Article 2, Section 1.  Taxpayer\u2019s Bylaws repeat \nthis, stating that Taxpayer \u201cshall, at all times, be operated on a cooperative basis for the \nmutual benefits of its members.\u201d  Bylaws, Article 8, Section 1.  \nThe Articles of Incorporation authorize Taxpayer to issue a single class of \ncommon stock.  Articles of Incorporation, Article 6, Section 1.  That common stock has a \npar value of $30 per share and is entitled to receive a noncumulative dividend of not \nmore than 8 percent per share as determined by the Board of Directors of the Taxpayer.  \nThe common stock is membership stock.  Each member of Taxpayer is required to \n                                           \n1. While the Articles of Incorporation refer to Taxpayer as an agent, Taxpayer acts as a principal in its \ngrain marketing activities, purchasing grain from its members and others and bearing the benefits and \nburdens of ownership of the grain until it sells the grain to customers.\nPLR-100983-11\n3\npurchase one share of common stock.  Bylaws, Article 3, Section 2.  Taxpayer\u2019s Bylaws \nlimit membership to persons that are producers of agricultural products and to \ncooperative associations of such producers.  Bylaws, Article 3, Section 1.  The Bylaws \nprovide that \u201c[e]ach holder of Common Stock of the Association shall be entitled to one \n(1) vote in all matters wherein the shareholders of this Association shall be entitled to \nvote regardless of the number of shares of Common Stock owned by each such \nshareholder.\u201d  Bylaws, Article 9, Section 2.  At -----------, 2010, there were ------shares of \ncommon stock issued and outstanding, entitled in the aggregate to a dividend of not \nmore than $--------- per annum.\nTaxpayer\u2019s Articles of Incorporation also authorize Taxpayer \u201cto establish book \ncredits, capital funds and other allocated reserves to provide funds for corporate \npurposes in the manner provided by the Bylaws by retains from net margins or \nproceeds otherwise payable to the members or patrons, or by other methods of \ncollection.\u201d  Articles of Incorporation, Article 7, Section 1.  Book credits are issued as the \nnoncash portion of the patronage dividends paid by Taxpayer to its members.  They \nprovide a significant source of equity capital for financing Taxpayer\u2019s business.  At -------\n-----------, 2010, the balance of book credits outstanding was $-------------. \nTaxpayer allocates and distributes its earnings each year from business done \nwith or for members to its members in the form of patronage dividends.  Article 8 of \nTaxpayer\u2019s Bylaws describes how Taxpayer computes and pays patronage refunds.  In \npertinent part, Section 3 provides:\n\u201cSection 3.  Obligation to Allocate Net Margins.  Each business patronage \ntransaction between the Association and a member shall be subject to and \ninclude as a part of its terms, the obligation of the Association to allocate \nas patronage dividends to such member, its net margin for each fiscal \nyear \u2026 to the extent attributable to the business patronage by such \nmembers for such period.  All such net margins of the Association from \nbusiness patronage by its members shall be allocated and credited to the \naccounts of such members on a basis proportionate to the value of their \nindividual business patronage with the Association. \u2026\u201d \nThat section of the Bylaws goes on to provide that Taxpayer will allocate its net margins \nbased on departments:\n\u201c\u2026 (1) The net earnings of the \u2018grain trading department\u2019 arising from \nbusiness done with members shall be allocated to each such member \nbased upon their respective pounds of grain sold through the Association; \n(2) the net earnings of the \u2018warehouse and grain handling department\u2019 \narising from business done with members shall be allocated to each such \nmember based upon the dollar amount of their respective storage and \nhandling charges; and (3) the net earnings from any other pool, \ndepartment or classification arising from business done with members \nPLR-100983-11\n4\nshall be allocated to each such member based upon the quantity or value \n(whichever is appropriate, as the case may be) of their marketing through \nor purchases from the Association.\u201d  Bylaws, Article 8, Section 3. \nConsistent with these directions, Taxpayer allocates patronage dividends each \nyear on the basis of two departments:  grain marketing (with patronage dividends \nallocated based upon pounds), and warehouse and grain handling (with patronage \ndividends allocated based on dollars of storage and handling fees paid by each \nmember).\nArticle 8, Section 4 of the Bylaws authorizes Taxpayer to pay patronage \ndividends in cash and written notices of allocation (referred to by Taxpayer as \u201cbook \ncredits\u201d).  The book credits may be qualified or nonqualified.  Over the years, Taxpayer \nhas issued both qualified and nonqualified written notices of allocation.\nThe Bylaws direct Taxpayer to retain any net margins attributable to business \ndone with nonmembers not dealing with Taxpayer on a patronage basis and to any \nnonpatronage business (including any extraneous business with the federal government \nor its agencies).  Bylaws, Article 8, Sections 10 and 11.  Since, as noted above, \nTaxpayer does not do business with any nonmember patrons on a patronage basis, \nTaxpayer retains all net margins attributable to nonmember business.  The amount of \nbusiness conducted with nonmembers varies from year to year.  In recent years, \nnonmember business has constituted approximately ---- percent of Taxpayer\u2019s \nmarketing business.  \nTaxpayer\u2019s Bylaws address what is to be done in the event of a loss.  In general, \nthe Bylaws permit losses to be netted between allocation units subject to some \nlimitations.  Bylaws, Article 8, Section 14.  The Bylaws further provide that losses in a \ndepartment \u201cshall be allocated to all members who patronized such department or \nclassification on the same basis as net margins are distributable hereunder.\u201d  Bylaws, \nArticle 8, Section 12.  \nIn the event of dissolution, the Articles of Incorporation provide generally that \nassets shall be distributed in the following order of priority:  first, to pay all debts; \nsecond, to pay holders of book credits an amount equal to the stated dollar amount; \nthird, to pay common stockholders an amount equal to the par value; fourth, to pay \ncurrent year patronage dividends, and fifth, to pay any allocated reserves to the persons \nto whom they are allocated.  If any assets then remain, they:\n\u201c\u2026 shall be distributed among the members of the Association in \nproportion equal to the amount each member\u2019s unrefunded contributions \nto the Common Stock, book credits, capital funds and allocated reserves \nof the Association bears to the total unrefunded contributions to the \nCommon Stock, book credits, capital funds and allocated reserves of all \nPLR-100983-11\n5\nmembers at the time of commencement of liquidation.  If at such time \nthere are no unrefunded  contributions or allocated reserves credited on \nthe books of the Association to members, then any remaining balance \nshall be distributed among the members of the Association in their \nrespective proportion equal to the ratio that each member\u2019s dollar value of \ncombined marketing and purchasing through the Association during the \nthree (3) year period immediately preceding the date of such distribution \nshall bear to the total dollar value of all members combined marketing and \npurchasing through the Association during such period by all members at \nsuch time.\u201d  (Articles of Incorporation, Article 8, Section 8).      \nThis ruling relates to Taxpayer\u2019s grain marketing activities.  Taxpayer conducts \nits grain marketing through --------- elevators.   Most of the grain that Taxpayer markets \nis destined for the bulk export market.\nTaxpayer occasionally sells barley locally for livestock feed.  In such instances, \nthe customer will pick up the barley by truck at Taxpayer\u2019s elevator, and Taxpayer will \nload it out for them.  However, as in the case of wheat, most of the barley that Taxpayer \nmarkets is shipped to the export market.  Taxpayer\u2019s patronage grain business consists \nof buying grain from members, handling and storing the grain at its elevators, and \nselling the grain to customers.  \nThe principal issue in this ruling relates to the characterization for purposes of \nsubchapter T of the Code and section 199 of the amounts (referred to in this ruling as \n\u201cgrain payments\u201d) that Taxpayer pays its members for their grain when it acquires the \ngrain for marketing on a patronage basis.  For purposes of this ruling, the term \u201cgrain \npayments\u201d does not include any amounts paid to persons not entitled to share in \npatronage dividends.  For purposes of this ruling, the term \u201cgrain payments\u201d also does \nnot include patronage dividends paid to members of Taxpayer with respect to grain \nmarketed for them.\nTaxpayer does not operate on a pooling basis.  Thus, Taxpayer\u2019s marketing \nproceeds are not shared equally on the basis of patronage and distributed in the form of \nharvest advances and progress payments with a final settlement after the pool closes \nas they would be if Taxpayer pooled.  Commodity price risk does not automatically shift \nfrom Taxpayer\u2019s members to a pool at the time of harvest.  Rather, it remains with \nmembers until they sell their grain to Taxpayer for marketing.  \nTaxpayer pays each member a market price for his or her grain.  What that \nmarket price is depends upon where, when and how a member chooses to sell his or \nher grain to Taxpayer.  That market price is determined without regard to the actual net \nproceeds from marketing grain.  Payments are made in cash (by check) and occur \nthroughout the year as members sell grain to Taxpayer for marketing and are paid \npursuant to the terms of their individual contracts.  \nPLR-100983-11\n6\nAfter purchasing grain from members, Taxpayer then markets each member\u2019s \ngrain along with the grain of all of its other members in the manner that it judges will \nproduce the best return.  After year end, when net earnings for the year have been \ndetermined (after treating amounts paid to members for their grain as a cost of the \ngrain), Taxpayer pays a patronage dividend to its members with respect to the grain \nthey market through Taxpayer.  \nGrain farmers in the United States historically have retained the decision of to \nwhom, when and how to sell their grain.  The basic choices available to a member \nselling grain to Taxpayer for marketing on a cooperative basis are:  (i) to sell the grain \nfor Taxpayer\u2019s current cash bid price, (ii) to sell the grain to Taxpayer using a fixed price \ncontract, or (iii) to sell the grain to Taxpayer using a form of contract that leaves the \nprice to be paid for the grain open to be determined at a later date.  These choices are \nsimilar to those offered farmers by commercial grain companies, though commercial \ngrain companies do not market grain on a patronage basis and do not pay patronage \ndividends.\nOne way for a farmer to sell grain to Taxpayer for marketing is to sell the grain to \nTaxpayer and be paid the cash bid price.  Taxpayer\u2019s cash bid schedule is driven by the \nprices for grain in ------------, Taxpayer\u2019s principal market for grain.  The prices that \nTaxpayer quotes are referred to as \u201c------------\u201d prices since at any time they are \ndetermined by the bid prices in -------------less a differential (the \u201c------------ differential\u201d).  \nThe cash bid prices are for grain that meets normal quality standards.  Grain is \nweighed and tested when it is delivered by the member to one of Taxpayer\u2019s elevators.  \nIf the grain includes such things as broken kernels and foreign matter, the weight is \nadjusted.  If wheat is above or below certain protein standards, a premium is paid or a \ndiscount is charged.  \nThere are then a variety of adjustments in arriving at the net amount paid to the \nfarmer.  \n\uf0b7\nThe first two deductions were for barge and truck fuel surcharges.  \nTaxpayer\u2019s truck and barge contracts contain an adjustment for fuel costs, \nwhich it passes on to its members.  \n\uf0b7\nThe third deduction was an adjustment for discounts.  \n\uf0b7\nThe fourth deduction was for storage.  \n\uf0b7\nThe fifth and seventh adjustments were for a special handling charge to \ncompensate Taxpayer for its interest costs involved in carrying grain.  That \ncharge is made in the case of all grain purchases, but then reversed for \ngrain where the purchase price is less than $6.00 per bushel.\nPLR-100983-11\n7\n\uf0b7\nThe sixth charge was for \u201cgrain tax/checkoff fee\u201d for the State A --------------\n------------------.  \nTaxpayer\u2019s bid price schedule changes from hour to hour and day to day as the -\n------------ bid prices change.  A farmer can deliver and sell grain to Taxpayer at the cash \nbid price at the time of harvest, delivering the grain directly from the field.  However, it \nusually is not advantageous for farmers to sell then since prices often are lowest at \nharvest.  Many farmers have the capacity to store grain on farm and so can wait until \nlater, when they think that the cash bid price is right, to deliver and sell their grain to \nTaxpayer.  Other farmers deliver their grain to Taxpayer for storage, not for immediate \nsale.  The farmers retain ownership of the grain in the elevator and pay storage fees to \nTaxpayer.  Later, when a farmer believes the cash bid price is right, he or she can sell \nthe grain to Taxpayer for marketing on a cooperative basis.  \nA farmer has the option of entering into a fixed price contract to sell his or her \nwheat to Taxpayer.  Fixed price contracts call for delivery of a specified quantity and \nquality of grain, at a specified location, during a specified time period.  Fixed price \ncontracts can be entered into before the grain is planted, while it is growing or after \nharvest while the grain is being stored on the farm or in an elevator.  \nFarmers interested in entering into a fixed price contract with Taxpayer for wheat \ncan determine the price Taxpayer is willing to pay for delivery at various times in the \nfuture from Taxpayer\u2019s bid schedule for grain.  Taxpayer is able to offer fixed price \npurchase contracts for wheat and barley because it can hedge its price exposure by \nentering into corresponding fixed price contracts with its customers or can hedge by \npurchasing offsetting futures contracts at one of the futures exchanges. \nTaxpayer also purchases grain from members on a deferred price basis, using \nwhat Taxpayer refers to as a \u201cDelayed Price Purchase Agreement.\u201d  When Taxpayer \npurchases grain on this basis, title to the grain passes to Taxpayer, and it can sell the \ngrain.  The member retains the right to price the grain at Taxpayer\u2019s cash bid price at a \ndate of his or her choosing (but not later than a set date).  The grain was not priced at \nthe time it was delivered.  The farmer has until a future fixed date to decide when he or \nshe wants to price the grain.  The benefit to the farmer is that he or she does not need \nto pay storage fees while waiting to price the grain since title to the grain passes to \nTaxpayer.  \nSome farmers prefer to sell their grain to Taxpayer on a deferred payment basis.  \nGrain sold on that basis might be delivered in October, the price set at that time, but \nwith payment to be made in January.  Ownership of the grain passes to Taxpayer when \nthe grain is delivered or at the time set in the agreement, with payment at a later date.  \nTaxpayer does not have a separate form that it uses for deferred payment \narrangements.  When grain is purchased on that basis, the deferred payment date is \nspecified on its normal contracts.  \nPLR-100983-11\n8\nThe options available to farmers for selling their grain to Taxpayer provide \nmembers with a reasonable amount of flexibility.  Farmers can lock in prices for their \nwheat (even before the wheat is planted or while it is growing) at any time if they think \nthat the price is right by using fixed price purchase contracts.  If farmers think that the \ncash price is low at the time of harvest, they can harvest and store their grain while \nwaiting for the price to improve.  Farmers with grain in storage on the farm or at \nTaxpayer can then sell grain that is in storage at any time at the cooperative\u2019s cash bid \nprice.  Farmers are also given the option of delivering their grain to Taxpayer leaving the \nprice open, to be determined by the farmer in the future.\nThese choices are available to all farmers marketing their grain on a cooperative \nbasis through Taxpayer.  Because of these choices, two neighbors that market the \nsame quantity and quality of a particular kind of grain through Taxpayer during any year \nwill receive different grain payments depending upon where, when and how they sell \ntheir grain to Taxpayer.  However, they will receive the same patronage dividends with \nrespect to grain marketing.\nFor the fiscal year ended -----------, 2010, Taxpayer\u2019s grain payments to members \nexceeded $--- million.  Taxpayer paid patronage dividends to members with respect to \ntheir grain sales and handling and storage of $-----------.  Of this amount, $--------- was \npaid in cash and $----------- was paid in nonqualified written notices of allocation (book \ncredits).\nTaxpayer historically has treated grain payments made in cash to members as \n\u201cpurchases\u201d for tax purposes and reported them on Schedule A, Line 2 of its Form \n1120-C.  Taxpayer has not treated the grain payments made in cash as \u201cper-unit retain \nallocations paid in money\u201d and therefore has not reported them on Schedule A, Line 4b \nof its Form 1120-C.  It has reported the patronage dividends paid to members as a \npatronage dividend paid in money and qualified written notices of allocation on \nSchedule H, lines 3a and 3b of its Form 1120-C.   \nBecause of this reporting, grain payments paid in cash historically entered into \nthe determination for tax purposes of Taxpayer\u2019s cost of goods sold for tax purposes.  \nAs is customary in the grain business, Taxpayer has valued its grain inventories at year \nend at market for financial statement and tax purposes.\nTaxpayer has not added back grain payments in its computations of the domestic \nproduction activities deduction under section 199 of the Code for prior years.  Taxpayer \npassed a small amount of its section 199 deduction through to its members in prior \nyears.\nRecent developments have caused Taxpayer to reconsider how it should treat its \ngrain payments for purposes of its section 199 computation.  For reasons described \nbelow, Taxpayer is seeking confirmation that all grain payments to members that are \npaid in cash should be classified as \u201cper-unit retain allocations paid in money.\u201d  \nPLR-100983-11\n9\nTaxpayer plans to change the reporting on its tax return for grain payments to \nmember, reporting grain payments to members on Line 4b of Schedule A of its Form \n1120-C, rather than on line 2.  The grain payments will, as in the past, enter into the \ndetermination for tax purposes of Taxpayer\u2019s cost of goods sold for tax purposes.  \nThere will be no impact on Taxpayer\u2019s grain inventories since, as is customary in the \ngrain business, Taxpayer will continue to value its grain inventories at year end at \nmarket for financial statement and tax purposes.   In addition, Taxpayer plans to treat \ngrain payments as per-unit retain allocations paid in money for purposes of computing \nits section 199 deduction commencing with its fiscal year ended -----------, 2010.\nTaxpayer does not intend to modify its Articles of Incorporation, Bylaws and grain \nagreements in any manner to change the labels placed upon the payments.  It is \nTaxpayer\u2019s view that such changes are not required since the definitions in the Code \nfocus on substance and not labels.\nTaxpayer will make certain that it does not exclude or deduct any grain payments \ntwice on its tax return or add back any grain payments twice in its section 199 \ncomputation.  Taxpayer may retain all or a portion of its section 199 deduction, or it may \npass all or a portion of that deduction through to its members.\nBased on the foregoing, Taxpayer requests the following rulings:\n1.\nGrain payments to members constitute \u201cper-unit retain allocations paid in money\u201d \nwithin the meaning of section 1382(b)(3) of the Code. \n2.\nFor purposes of computing its section 199 domestic production activities \ndeduction, Taxpayer\u2019s qualified production activities income and taxable income \nshould, pursuant to section 199(d)(3)(C) of the Code, be computed without \nregard to any deduction for grain payments to members. \nNonexempt subchapter T cooperatives are permitted to exclude or deduct \ndistributions to patrons that qualify as per-unit retain allocations or patronage dividends, \nprovided the distributions otherwise meet the requirements of subchapter T of the Code.\nSection 1388(f) of the Code defines the term \u201cper-unit retain allocation\u201d to mean \n\u201cany allocation, by an organization to which part I of [subchapter T] applies, to a patron \nwith respect to products marketed for him, the amount of which is fixed without \nreference to net earnings of the organization pursuant to an agreement between the \norganization and the patron.\u201d\nPer-unit retain allocations may be made in money, property or certificates.  Per-\nunit retain allocations paid in money and in property are excludable or deductible under \nsection 1382(b)(3) of the Code.  Per-unit retain allocations paid in certificates are \ndeductible under section 1382(b)(3) if the certificates are qualified.  If the certificates are \nPLR-100983-11\n10\nnonqualified, the cooperative is permitted a deduction under section 1382(b)(4) (or a tax \nbenefit figured under section 1383) when the certificates are later redeemed.\nSection 1388(a)(1) of the Code provides that the term \u201cpatronage dividend\u201d \nmeans an amount paid to a patron by a cooperative on the basis of the quantity or value \nof business done with or for such patron.  Section 1388(a)(2) provides that a \u201cpatronage \ndividend\u201d is an amount paid \u201cunder an obligation\u201d that must have existed before the \ncooperative received the amount so paid.  Section 1388(a)(3) provides that \u201cpatronage \ndividend\u201d means an amount paid to a patron that is determined by reference to the net \nearnings of the cooperative from business done with or for its patrons.  That section \nfurther provides that a \u201cpatronage dividend\u201d does not include any amount paid to a \npatron to the extent that such amount is out of earnings other than from business done \nwith or for patrons.  Section 1.1382-3(c)(2) of the Income Tax Regulations states that \nincome derived from sources other than patronage means incidental income derived \nfrom sources not directly related to the marketing, purchasing, or service activities of the \ncooperative association.\nPatronage dividends may be paid in money, property or written notices of \nallocation.  Patronage dividends paid in money and in property are excludable or \ndeductible under section 1382(b)(1) of the Code.  Patronage dividends paid in written \nnotices of allocation are deductible under section 1382(b)(1) if the written notices of \nallocation are qualified.  If the notices are nonqualified, the cooperative is permitted a \ndeduction under section 1382(b)(2) (or a tax benefit figured under section 1383) when \nthe notices are later redeemed.\nSection 1388(b) of the Code provides that the term \u201cwritten notice of allocation\u201d \nmeans any capital stock, revolving fund certificate, retain certificate, certificate of \nindebtedness, letter of advice, or other written notice, which discloses to the recipient \nthe stated dollar amount allocated to him by the organization and the portion thereof, if \nany, which constitutes a patronage dividend.\nFor cooperatives that use pooling, Rev. Rul. 67-333, 1967-2 C.B. 299, provides \nthat pool advances are treated as per-unit retain allocations and the final pool payment, \nmade after net earnings have been determined, is treated as a patronage dividend.\nUnder section 199(d)(3) of the Code, patrons that receive a qualified payment \nfrom a specified agricultural or horticultural cooperative are allowed a deduction for an \namount allocable to their portion of qualified production activities income (QPAI) of the \norganization received as a qualified patronage dividend or per-unit retain allocation \nwhich is paid in qualified per-unit retain certificates.  In particular, section 199(d)(3)(F) \nrequires the cooperative to be engaged in the manufacturing, production, growth, or \nextraction in whole or significant part of any agricultural or horticultural product, or in the \nmarketing of agricultural or horticultural products.  Under section 199(d)(3)(D), in the \ncase of a cooperative engaged in the marketing of agricultural and horticultural \nproducts, the cooperative is treated as having manufactured, produced, grown, or \nPLR-100983-11\n11\nextracted (MPGE) in whole or significant part any qualifying production property \nmarketed by the cooperative that its patrons have MPGE (this is known in the industry \nas the \u201ccooperative attribution rule\u201d).  In addition, section 199(d)(3)(A)(ii) requires the \ncooperative to designate the patron\u2019s portion of the income allocable to the QPAI of the \norganization in a written notice mailed by the cooperative to its patrons no later than the \n15th day of the ninth month following the close of the tax year.\nUnder section 1.199-6(c) of the regulations, for purposes of determining a \ncooperative\u2019s section 199 deduction, the cooperative\u2019s QPAI and taxable income are \ncomputed without taking into account any deduction allowable under section 1382(b) or \n(c) of the Code (relating to patronage dividends, per-unit retain allocations, and \nnonpatronage distributions).\nAn agricultural or horticultural cooperative is permitted to \u201cpass-through\u201d to its \npatrons all or any portion of its section 199 deduction for the year provided it does so in \nthe manner and within the time limits set by section 199(d)(3) of the Code.  When a \ncooperative passes-through all or any portion of the section 199 deduction, the \ncooperative remains entitled to claim the entire section 199 deduction on its return, but \nis required under section 199(d)(3)(B) to reduce the deduction or exclusion it would \notherwise claim under section 1382(b) for per-unit retain allocations and patronage \ndividends.  \nSection 199(d)(3)(A) of the Code provides that a cooperative passes through an \namount of its section 199 deduction by \u201cidentifying\u201d such amount in a written notice \nmailed to such person during the payment period described in section 1382(d).  \nSection 1382(d) provides that the payment period for a year is the period beginning with \nthe first day of such taxable year and ending with the fifteenth day of the ninth month \nfollowing the close of such year.\nSection 1.199-6(g) of the regulations provides that in order for a patron to qualify \nfor the section 199 deduction, section 1.199-6(a) requires that the cooperative identify in \na written notice the patron's portion of the section 199 deduction that is attributable to \nthe portion of the cooperative's QPAI for which the cooperative is allowed a section 199 \ndeduction.  This written notice must be mailed by the cooperative to its patrons no later \nthan the 15th day of the ninth month following the close of the taxable year.  The \ncooperative may use the same written notice, if any, that it uses to notify patrons of their \nrespective allocations of patronage dividends, or may use a separate timely written \nnotice(s) to comply with this section.  The cooperative must report the amount of the \npatron's section 199 deduction on Form 1099-PATR, \u201cTaxable Distributions Received \nFrom Cooperatives,\u201d issued to the patron.\nWhile a cooperative is permitted to disregard per-unit retain allocations and \npatronage dividends in its section 199 deduction, section 1.199-6(l) of the regulations \nprovide that a qualified payment received by a patron of a cooperative is not taken into \naccount by the patron for purposes of section 199. \nPLR-100983-11\n12\nSection 1.199-6(e) of the regulations defines the term \u201cqualified payment\u201d to \nmean any amount of a patronage dividend or per-unit retain allocation, as described in \nsection 1385(a)(1) or (3) of the Code received by the patron from a cooperative, that is \nattributable to the portion of the cooperative\u2019s QPAI, for which the cooperative is \nallowed a section 199 deduction.  For this purpose, patronage dividends and per-unit \nretain allocations include any advances on patronage and per-unit retains paid in money \nduring the taxable year.\nTaxpayer is a \u201cspecified agricultural or horticultural cooperative\u201d within the \nmeaning of section 199(d)(3)(F) of the Code and section 1.199-6(f) of the regulations.  It \nis an organization \u201cto which part I of subchapter T applies\u201d (i.e., it is a nonexempt \ncooperative to which subchapter T applies).  It is engaged \u201cin the marketing of \nagricultural or horticultural products\u201d (i.e., grain, which it markets, and seed, which it \nsells to its members).\nAs a specified agricultural or horticultural cooperative, Taxpayer is entitled to the \nbenefit of section 199(d)(3)(C) of the Code and section 1.199-6(c) of the regulations, \nwhich permit such cooperatives to disregard deductions under section 1382(b) and (c) \nfor purposes of computing QPAI and taxable income for purposes of section 199.  \nSection 1382(b) provides deductions for per-unit retain allocations paid in money, \nproperty and qualified per-unit retain certificates as well as for patronage dividends paid \nin money, property and qualified written notices of allocation.  It also provides for \ndeductions when nonqualified per-unit retain certificates and nonqualified written notices \nof allocation are redeemed.  As a specified agricultural or horticultural cooperative, \nTaxpayer is entitled to the benefit of section 199(d)(3)(C) and section 1.199-6(c), which \npermit such cooperatives to disregard deductions under section 1382(b) and (c) for \npurposes of computing QPAI and taxable income for purposes of section 199.  Section \n1382(b) provides deductions for per-unit retain allocations paid in money, property and \nqualified per-unit retain certificates as well as for patronage dividends paid in money, \nproperty and qualified written notices of allocation.  It also provides for deductions when \nnonqualified per-unit retain certificates and nonqualified written notices of allocation are \nredeemed.\nTaxpayer does not operate on a pooling basis.  Taxpayer purchases grain from \nmembers and markets the grain.  The amount that each member receives when he or \nshe sells grain to Taxpayer for marketing depends upon where, how, and when the \nmember chooses to sell that grain to Taxpayer.  \nMembers have a number of options for determining how and when sales are \nmade.  As stated above, two neighbors delivering the same amount of grain to \nTaxpayer during any year will be paid different amounts for that grain depending upon \nwhere, when, and how they sell the grain to Taxpayer.  However, all members share in \nTaxpayer\u2019s net earnings from marketing operations in proportion to the quantity of \ngrains they market through Taxpayer.  Those net earnings are distributed after the end \nPLR-100983-11\n13\nof each year in the form of patronage dividends paid in cash and qualified written\nnotices of allocation. \nThe question presented in this ruling is whether the grain payments made by \nTaxpayer to members for grain qualify as per-unit retain allocations paid in money within \nthe meaning of section 1388(f) of the Code.\nUnder section 199 of the Code and section 1.199-6 of the regulations, the \nanswer to this question determines who gets to include the grain payments in the \nsection 199 computation.  If the grain payments to members are per-unit retain \nallocations paid in money, then they should be added-back in Taxpayer\u2019s section 199 \ncomputation and not included in the members\u2019 section 199 computations.  If the grain \npayments to members are not per-unit retain allocations paid in money, then they \nshould not be added-back in Taxpayer\u2019s section 199 computation, but should be \nincluded in the members\u2019 section 199 computations.  These results are the same \nwhether Taxpayer decides to keep or to pass-through all or a portion of its section 199 \ndeduction.\nGrain marketing cooperatives like Taxpayer have never thought of their grain \npayments as per-unit retain allocations paid in money.  However, Taxpayer\u2019s grain \npayments appear to meet the definition of \u201cper-unit retain allocations paid in money\u201d \nwhich are excludible or deductible under section 1382(b)(3) of the Code.  The grain \npayments are made in cash so the \u201cpaid in money\u201d requirement is met.  \nTaxpayer\u2019s grain payments also meet all the requirements of the definition of \n\u201cper-unit retain allocation\u201d contained in section 1388(f) of the Code, which defines the \nterm \u201cper-unit retain allocation\u201d to mean \u201cany allocation, by an organization to which part \nI of this subchapter applies, to a patron with respect to products marketed for him, the \namount of which is fixed without reference to the net earnings of the organization \npursuant to an agreement between the organization and the patron.\u201d \nFirst, Taxpayer\u2019s grain payments to a member are paid \u201cpursuant to an \nagreement,\u201d namely the particular agreement applicable to the method the member \nuses to determine how and when his or her grain is sold to Taxpayer.  Reporting grain \npayments as per-unit retain allocations paid in money in box 3 of Form 1099-PATR \ndemonstrates that Taxpayer and its patrons agreed to treat grain payments as per-unit \nretain allocations paid in money.\nSecond, Taxpayer\u2019s grain payments to a member are made \u201cwith respect to \nproducts marketed for him,\u201d namely, the grain delivered by the member for marketing by \nTaxpayer.  As described above, Taxpayer markets the grain it acquires from members, \nand members share in Taxpayer\u2019s net earnings from its marketing activities in the form \nof patronage dividends.  \nPLR-100983-11\n14\nThird, the amount of the grain payments to each member \u201cis fixed without \nreference to the net earnings\u201d of Taxpayer since, at the time the payments are made, \nTaxpayer\u2019s actual net earnings for the year are neither known nor determinable.  \nWhile per-unit retains are often made on the basis of a specified amount per unit \nof product marketed, what is important is that they not be made with respect to net \nearnings.  Rev. Rul. 68-236, 1968-2 C.B. 236, provides that \u201cto constitute a per-unit \nretain allocation, the allocation need not be made strictly on the basis of a specified \namount per-unit of product marketed provided it is made with respect to products \nmarketed for the patron and not with respect to the net earnings of the organization.  \nWhether an allocation meets the foregoing description will be a question of fact.\u201d\nThe fact that all members do not receive the same payments for their grain (i.e., \nthat Taxpayer does not pool) does not mean that grain payments should not be treated \nas per-unit retain allocations paid in money.  In Farm Service Cooperative v. \nCommissioner, 619 F. 2d 718 (8th Cir. 1980), the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals \ncharacterized payments to Farm Service\u2019s poultry growers as per-unit retain allocations \npaid in money, even though they were determined under a formula that resulted in \nsome poultry growers receiving more than others depending upon the efficiency of their \noperations and the market price of chickens when they delivered their chickens to Farm \nService.  The Tax Court in Farm Service Cooperative v. Commissioner, 70 T.C. 145, \n147-148 (1978), described the formula as follows:\n\u201cThe grower was paid by petitioner for growing chickens based on the \ndelivery weight to the processing plant, less the weight of chickens \ncondemned by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.  The formula under \nwhich the grower was paid also took into account variable market rates for \nfull grown chickens, and an efficiency factor that related the number of \npounds of feed to the pounds of chickens produced.  The efficiency factor \nwas figured into the grower's compensation because Farm Service \nsupplied all chicken feed.  Under the contract provisions established with \neach of the growers, there was also a guaranteed minimum amount the \ngrower would receive from the cooperative irrespective of wholesale \nmarket variations.  For example, the contract in effect on July 1, 1968, \nprovided that \u2018In no event will the Grower Member receive less than 1.25 \ncents per pound less U.S.D.A. condemnation.\u2019  On its books, petitioner \ntreated payments to its growers as a cost of production.\u201d\nTaxpayer has treated its grain payments as \u201cpurchases,\u201d not as \u201cper-unit retain \nallocations paid in money.\u201d  However, how the payments have been reported by \nTaxpayer in prior years does not determine how the payments are treated prospectively \nin this ruling.  \nPLR-100983-11\n15\nWhether or not Taxpayer is pooling is a moot issue for purpose of this ruling \nbecause its grain payments meet the definition of \u201cper-unit retain allocations paid in \nmoney\u201d in any event.  Nothing in subchapter T of the Code limits the exclusion or \ndeduction for per-unit retain allocations to cooperatives with pools.\nSection 1.199-6(k) of the regulations provides that section 1.199-6 is the \nexclusive method for the cooperative and its patrons to compute the amount of the \nsection 199 deduction.\nThe effect of these sections is that a cooperative such as Taxpayer will compute \nthe entire section 199 deduction at the cooperative level and that none of the \ndistributions whether patronage dividends or per-unit retain allocations received from \nthe cooperative will be eligible for section 199 in the patron\u2019s hands.  That is, the patron \nmay not count the qualified payment received from the cooperative in the patron\u2019s own \nsection 199 computation whether or not the cooperative keeps or passes through the \nsection 199 deduction.  Accordingly, the only way that a patron can claim a section 199 \ndeduction for a qualified payment received from a cooperative is for the cooperative to \npass-through the section 199 amount in accordance with the provisions of section \n199(d)(3) of the Code and the regulations thereunder.\nWe note that to prevent a cooperative from deducting the per-unit retain \nallocations made in money or qualified certificates for the second time when the \nassociated grain is sold, the cost of goods sold mechanism associated with inventory \nmust be adjusted to reflect the deductions allowable under subchapter T of the Code.  \nSpecifically, cooperatives need to include the per-unit retain allocations in inventory cost \nfor purposes of making inventory and section 263A of the Code computations and then \nadjust the ending inventory and cost of goods sold to prevent double deduction of the \nper-unit retain allocations.  The adjustments can be made to either the inventory or the \nline item deduction for the per-unit retain allocations.  In other words, if the per-unit \nretain allocations are deducted on a deduction line in the cooperative's tax return, they \nshould be removed entirely from the ending inventory and cost of goods sold computed \nfor the tax year.  Alternatively, if the per-unit retain allocations are not deducted on a \ndeduction line in the tax return, the per-unit retain allocations reflected in the ending \ninventory should be removed and included in the cost of goods sold amount for that tax \nyear.  This procedure will allow the cooperative to deduct the per-unit retain allocations \nonce while also preserving the integrity of its section 263A calculation.\nFor the reasons described above, Taxpayer\u2019s grain payments to members meet \nthe definition of \u201cper-unit retain allocations paid in money.\u201d  The per-unit retains must be \ntreated as such for all purposes of the Code and are reported in box 3 of Form 1099-\nPATR.  If properly treated as per-unit retain allocations paid in money, then Taxpayer \nwill be entitled to disregard such payments in determining the amount of its section 199 \ndeduction.\nPLR-100983-11\n16\nWe also note that payments to nonmembers who are not eligible to share in \npatronage dividends (i.e., those with whom Taxpayer does not operate on a cooperative \nbasis with) do not constitute per-unit retains paid in money within the meaning of section \n1382(b)(3) of the Code and, accordingly, are treated exclusively as purchases in the \ncost of goods sold mechanism.\nAccordingly, we rule as requested that:\n1.\nGrain payments to members constitute \u201cper-unit retain allocations paid in money\u201d \nwithin the meaning of section 1382(b)(3) of the Code. \n2.\nFor purposes of computing its section 199 domestic production activities \ndeduction, Taxpayer\u2019s qualified production activities income and taxable income should, \npursuant to section 199(d)(3)(C) of the Code, be computed without regard to any \ndeduction for grain payments to members.\nThe conclusions set forth in this ruling address only purchases that are per-unit \nretain allocations paid in money as they relate to grains marketed by the cooperative \nduring the taxable year and does not apply to purchases of grain that remain in \ninventory at year end.

The information \nprovided in that letter and in later correspondence is summarized below.\nThe rulings contained in this letter are based upon information and representations \nsubmitted by the taxpayer and accompanied by a penalty of perjury statement executed \nby an appropriate party. This office has not verified any of the material submitted in \nsupport of the request for rulings, but such material is subject to verification on \nexamination.\nSummary of Facts\nParent is the common parent of an affiliated group of corporations that joins in the filing \nof a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return. Parent\u2019s group includes Sub. Sub \ncurrently has two classes of stock outstanding. Parent owns all of the outstanding \ncommon stock of Sub, and third parties hold all of the outstanding preferred stock. Sub \nis a State A Business company, and is subject to regulation by Department.\nPLR-122561-12\n3\nThe preferred stock in Sub is limited and preferred as to dividends and does not \nparticipate in corporate growth to any significant extent and is not convertible into \nanother class of stock. At issuance, the preferred stock was also not entitled to vote in \nthe election of Sub\u2019s directors. Sub\u2019s charter provides that if Sub fails to pay dividends \nfor a consecutive months (the \u201cDividend Condition\u201d), the preferred stock will be granted \nvoting rights, subject to the provisions of State A law (the \u201cLaw Condition\u201d). Sub failed to \npay dividends for a consecutive months as of Date 1. The taxpayer provided a letter \nfrom the Department which states that, under State A law, the conversion of Sub\u2019s class \nof nonvoting preferred stock into voting stock cannot occur without the Department\u2019s \napproval. Neither the preferred shareholders nor Sub has requested the Department\u2019s \napproval, and the Department has indicated that no approval will be forthcoming if \nrequested.\nOn Date 2, Parent filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. On Date 3, the bankruptcy court \nconfirmed Parent\u2019s plan of reorganization (the \u201cBankruptcy Plan\u201d), which will become \neffective at a future date. Sub agreed to be the sponsor of the Bankruptcy Plan. \nPursuant to the Bankruptcy Plan, Parent will issue to Sub (or Sub\u2019s designee) the Plan \nSponsor Share in satisfaction of an intercompany claim held by Sub in an amount of $b.  \nSub intends to designate a trust (the \u201cPlan Sponsor Stock Trust\u201d), of which Sub is the \nsole beneficiary as the holder of the Plan Sponsor Share. The trustee of the Plan \nSponsor Stock Trust, which is intended to be treated as a grantor trust for federal \nincome tax purposes, will hold and own the Plan Sponsor Share in the trust and \nexercise the voting rights and other rights relating to the Plan Sponsor Share, in each \ncase in accordance with the terms of a trust agreement with Sub.\nIn connection with Parent\u2019s Chapter 11 reorganization, Parent and Sub will enter into \nthe Agreement (collectively, the rights afforded by the Plan Sponsor Share and the \nAgreement are the \u201cConsent Rights\u201d). Generally, the Consent Rights are designed to \nprevent Parent from taking certain actions without the prior written consent of Sub.\nAs part of the Bankruptcy Plan, Parent will amend its corporate charter, which will result \nin a modified governance structure following the effective date of the Bankruptcy Plan \n(the \u201cParent Modified Governance Structure\u201d). Under the Modified Governance \nStructure, Parent\u2019s board of directors (the \u201cParent Board\u201d) will be reduced to c directors \nwho will serve staggered terms. At the expiration of any director\u2019s term or upon the \noccurrence of any other vacancy in the Parent Board, the then-current Parent Board \nshall nominate candidates to fill the vacancy. Pursuant to Parent\u2019s amended corporate \ncharter, such candidates may consist only of directors serving on Sub\u2019s board of \ndirectors or as then-current executive officers of Sub, and may include then-current \ndirectors serving on the Parent Board. Parent\u2019s stockholders shall elect new directors, \nby a majority of those voting, from the pool of candidates.\nOn Date 4, by order of the Court, the Rehabilitator was appointed and Sub entered into \na court-supervised rehabilitation proceeding pursuant to State A law (the \u201cRehabilitation \nPLR-122561-12\n4\nProceeding\u201d), whereupon the Rehabilitator took control of Sub, and Sub\u2019s Board of \nDirectors (the \u201cSub Board\u201d) resigned. On Date 5, the Rehabilitator filed a proposed Plan \nof Rehabilitation for Sub (the \u201cRehabilitation Plan\u201d), which is subject to approval by the \nCourt. The Rehabilitation Plan contemplates that, upon termination of the Rehabilitation \nProceeding, (i) a new Sub Board will be appointed by the Rehabilitator, subject to the \napproval of the Department as Sub\u2019s regulator and (ii) Sub\u2019s existing charter and by-\nlaws will be amended and restated to provide for, among other things, the make-up and \nmanner of election of the Sub Board following the Rehabilitation Proceeding.  Under the \namended and restated charter, the Sub Board will consist of seven members, each \nserving a staggered three-year term. The Sub Board will appoint a nominating \ncommittee, consisting of at least two of its own members.  At the expiration of any \ndirector\u2019s term or the occurrence of any other vacancy on the Sub Board, the \nnominating committee will nominate two candidates to fill the vacancy. The Department \nmust approve all such candidates. Parent, as Sub\u2019s sole common shareholder, shall \nelect new directors of Sub from the pool of candidates nominated by the nominating \ncommittee of the Sub Board and approved by the Department.\nRepresentations\nThe taxpayer makes the following representations:\n(a) Each of Parent and Sub is an includible corporation within the meaning of section \n1504(b).\n(b) When issued, the Sub preferred stock qualified under section 1504(a)(4).\n(c) Under State A law, the Sub\u2019s class of nonvoting preferred stock cannot obtain the \nright to vote for directors of Sub without prior approval from Department.  \n(d) Based upon information provided by the Department regarding the identity of the \nholders of the Sub preferred stock, no holder of such stock has been or is \nconsidered an Authorized Holder since Date 1.\nRulings\nBased solely on the information and representations submitted, we rule as follows:\n(1) Sub\u2019s failure to pay dividends for a consecutive months has not caused the Sub \npreferred stock to be treated as stock \u201centitled to vote\u201d under section 1504(a)(4) \nat any time.\n(2) Neither the changes in Sub\u2019s corporate governance under the Rehabilitation \nPlan, nor the Parent Modified Governance Structure that will be in effect following \nthe effective date of the Bankruptcy Plan, nor the Consent Rights that will be held \nPLR-122561-12\n5\nby Sub (or Plan Sponsor Stock Trust) following the effective date of the \nBankruptcy Plan, will cause Sub to become deconsolidated from Parent for \nfederal income tax purposes.\nCaveat\nExcept as expressly provided herein, no opinion is expressed or implied concerning the \ntax consequences of any aspect of any transaction or item discussed or referenced in \nthis letter.\nProcedural Statements\nThis ruling is directed only to the taxpayer requesting it. Section 6110(k)(3) of the Code \nprovides that it may not be used or cited as precedent.\nA copy of this letter must be attached to any income tax return to which it is relevant. \nAlternatively, taxpayers filing their returns electronically may satisfy this requirement by \nattaching a statement to their return that provides the date and control number of the \nletter ruling.\nIn accordance with the Power of Attorney on file with this office, a copy of this letter is \nbeing sent to your authorized representatives.\nSincerely,\n_Marie C.

You requested a ruling that certain lump sum payments you are \nrequired to make to Ex-spouse pursuant to a court judgment constitute alimony \npayments within the meaning of I.R.C \u00a7\u00a7 215(a) and 71(b).\nFACTS\nTaxpayer is an individual.  On Date 2, the family court in State entered a divorce \ndecree and a court judgment in proceedings between Taxpayer and Ex-spouse.  The \ncourt judgment effectuated an agreement between Taxpayer and Ex-spouse.  Among \nother provisions, the court judgment provided for lump sum and annual payments of \n\u201calimony.\u201d  \nParagraph 2 of the court judgment reads as follows:\nA\n     Taxpayer represented that there have been no lump sum alimony payments to date.\nLAW AND ANALYSIS\nI.R.C. \u00a7 215(a) provides in the case of an individual, there shall be allowed as a \ndeduction an amount equal to the alimony or separate maintenance payments paid \nduring such individual\u2019s taxable year.  \nI.R.C. \u00a7 215(b) provides that the term \u201calimony or separate maintenance\u201d means any \nalimony or separate maintenance payment (as defined in section 71(b)) which is \nincludible in the gross income of the recipient under section 71. \nI.R.C. \u00a7 71(a) provides that gross income includes amounts received as alimony or \nseparate maintenance payments.  Section 71(b)(1) defines the term \"alimony or \nseparate maintenance payment\" as \nany payment in cash if--(A) such payment is received by (or on behalf \nof) a spouse under a divorce or separation instrument, (B) the divorce \nor separation instrument does not designate such payment as a \npayment which is not includible in gross income under section 71 and \nnot allowable as a deduction under section 215, (C) in the case of an \nindividual legally separated from his spouse under a decree of divorce \nor of separate maintenance, the payee spouse and the payor spouse \nare not members of the same household at the time such payment is \nmade, and (D) there is no liability to make such payment for any period \nafter the death of the payee spouse and there is no liability to make \nany payment (in cash or property) as a substitute for such payment \nafter the death of the payee spouse.\nPLR-116451-16\n3\nIf a payment satisfies all of the factors set forth in section 71(b) then it is alimony, but \nif it fails to satisfy any one of the above factors, it is not alimony.  Rood v. \nCommissioner, T.C. Memo. 2012-122.  The mere fact that the documents may \ncharacterize a payment as alimony has no effect on the consequences of that payment \nfor federal tax purposes.  Hoover v. Commissioner, 102 F.3d 842, 844 (6th Cir. 1996).  \nThe payment is required pursuant to a court judgment entered as part of the divorce \nproceeding.  The first requirement is satisfied.  Taxpayer represented that the parties \nwill not be members of the same household at the time the lump sum payments are \nmade.  The third requirement is satisfied.  \nIf the divorce decree or other relevant document does not expressly state that the \npayment obligation terminates upon the death of the payee spouse, the payment will \nqualify as alimony provided that the termination of the obligation would occur by \noperation of state law.  Hoover, 102 F.3d at 845-46.  See also Notice 87-9, 1987-1 C.B. \n421 (divorce or separation instrument executed after December 31, 1984, need not \nexpressly state that the payor spouse\u2019s liability ends upon payee\u2019s death if termination \nwould occur by operation of state law).  The relevant document does not provide that \nthe lump sum payments will terminate upon the death of the payee spouse.  However, \nstate law provides that the payment will terminate upon the death of the payee spouse.  \nSee Cohan v. Feur, 810 N.E.2d 1222 (Mass. 2004).  The fourth requirement is satisfied.    \nThe second requirement is not satisfied in this case.  The court judgment provides \nthat the lump sum payments are non-taxable to Ex-spouse and non-deductible by \nTaxpayer.  The written instrument does not specifically reference sections 71 and 215.  \nHowever, the Tax Court has held that the designation in the instrument need not \nspecifically refer to sections 71 and 215.  The instrument must contain a clear, explicit \nand express direction that the payments are not to be treated as income for the \npayments not to satisfy this second requirement.  If there is no express direction that the \npayments are not to be treated as income, the payments are considered alimony for \nfederal income tax purposes.  Baker v. Commissioner, T.C. Memo. 2000-164 *8-9.  See \nalso Jaffe v. Commissioner, T.C. Memo. 1999-196.  \nThere is an express designation in the court judgment that the lump sum payments \nare not includible in Ex-spouse\u2019s income.  Therefore, the lump sum payments are not \nalimony.  This is especially apparent in this case because the parties agreed the annual \nalimony payment was taxable to Ex-spouse and deductible by Taxpayer.  The annual \nalimony payments would qualify as alimony for federal income tax purposes.   \nRULINGS\nBased solely on the information submitted and the representations set forth above, \nwe rule that:\nThe b lump sum payments of \u201calimony\u201d of $c ordered pursuant to the court judgment \neffectuating Taxpayer\u2019s and Ex-spouse\u2019s agreement do not constitute alimony \npayments within the meaning of I.R.C. \u00a7 71(b) and \u00a7 215(b).\nCAVEATS\nPLR-116451-16\n4\nExcept as expressly provided herein, no opinion is expressed or implied concerning \nthe tax consequences of any aspect of any transaction or item discussed or referenced \nin this letter.  No opinion is expressed as to the federal tax treatment of the transaction \nunder any other provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and the Treasury Regulations \nthat may be applicable or under any other general principles of federal income taxation.  \nThis letter ruling is only applicable to matters under our jurisdiction.

Under \nsection 168(i)(9)(A)(ii), if the amount allowable as a deduction under section 168 differs \nfrom the amount that-would be allowable as a deduction under section 167 using the \nmethod, period, first and last year convention, and salvage value used to compute \nregulated tax expense under section 168(i)(9)(A)(i), the taxpayer must make \nadjustments to a reserve to reflect the deferral of taxes resulting from such difference. \n \nSection 168(i)(9)(B)(i) of the Code provides that one way the requirements of \nsection 168(i)(9)(A) will not be satisfied is if the taxpayer, for ratemaking purposes, uses \na procedure or adjustment which is inconsistent with such requirements. Under section \n168(i)(9)(B)(ii), such inconsistent procedures and adjustments include the use of an \nestimate or projection of the taxpayer's tax expense, depreciation expense, or reserve \nfor deferred taxes under section 168(i)(9)(A)(ii), unless such estimate or projection is \nalso used, for ratemaking purposes, with respect to all three of these items and with \nrespect to the rate base. \n \nFormer section 167(l) of the Code generally provided that public utilities were \nentitled to use accelerated methods for depreciation if they used a \"normalization \nmethod of accounting.\" A normalization method of accounting was defined in former \nsection 167(l)(3)(G) in a manner consistent with that found in section 168(i)(9)(A). \n \nPLR-100960-07 \n \n \n4 \nSection 1.167(1)-1(a)(1) of the Income Tax Regulations provides that the normalization \nrequirements for public utility property pertain only to the deferral of federal income tax \nliability resulting from the use of an accelerated method of depreciation for computing \nthe allowance for depreciation under section 167 and the use of straight-line \ndepreciation for computing tax expense and depreciation expense for purposes of \nestablishing cost of services and for reflecting operating results in regulated books of \naccount. These regulations do not pertain to other book-tax timing differences with \nrespect to state income taxes, F.I.C.A. taxes, construction costs, or any other taxes and \nitems. \n \nSection 1.167(l)-1(h)(1)(i) of the regulations provides that the reserve established \nfor public utility property should reflect the total amount of the deferral of federal income \ntax liability resulting from the taxpayer's use of different depreciation methods for tax \nand ratemaking purposes. \n \nSection 1.167(1)-1(h)(1)(iii) of the regulations provides that the amount of federal \nincome tax liability deferred as a result of the use of different depreciation methods for \ntax and ratemaking purposes is the excess (computed without regard to credits) of the \namount the tax liability would have been had the depreciation method for ratemaking \npurposes been used over the amount of the actual tax liability. This amount shall be \ntaken into account for the taxable year in which the different methods of depreciation \nare used. \n \nSection 1.167(1)-1(h)(2)(i) of the regulations provides that the taxpayer must \ncredit this amount of deferred taxes to a reserve for deferred taxes, a depreciation \nreserve, or other reserve account. This regulation further provides that the aggregate \namount allocable to deferred taxes may be reduced to reflect the amount for any \ntaxable year by which federal income taxes are greater by reason of the prior use of \ndifferent methods of depreciation under section 1.167(1)-1(h)(1)(i) or to reflect asset \nretirements or the expiration of the period for depreciation used for determining the \nallowance for depreciation under section 167(a). \n \nFormer section 46(f) of the Code provides an election for ratable flow through \nunder which an elector may flow through the investment tax credit to cost of service. \nHowever, former 46(f)(2)(A) provides that no investment tax credit is available if the \ntaxpayer's cost of service for ratemaking purposes or in its regulated books of account \nis reduced by more than a ratable portion of the credit determined under former 46(a) \nand allowable by section 38. Also, under former section 46(f)(2)(B) no investment tax \ncredit is available if the base to which the taxpayer's rate of return for ratemaking \npurposes is applied is reduced by reason of any portion of the credit determined under \nformer 46(a) and allowable by section 38. \n \nFormer section 46(f)(6) of the Code provides that for purposes of determining \nratable portions under former section 46(f)(2)(A), the period of time used in computing \n \nPLR-100960-07 \n \n \n5 \ndepreciation expense for purposes of reflecting operating results in the taxpayer's \nregulated books of account shall be used. \n \nUnder section 1.46-6(g)(2) of the regulations, \"ratable\" for purposes of former \nsection 46(f)(2) of the Code is determined by considering the period of time actually \nused in computing the taxpayer's regulated depreciation expense for the property for \nwhich a credit is allowed. Regulated depreciation expense is the depreciation expense \nfor the property used by a regulatory body for purposes of establishing the taxpayer's \ncost of service for ratemaking purposes. Such period of time shall be expressed in units \nof years (or shorter periods), units of production, or machine hours and shall be \ndetermined in accordance with the individual useful life or composite (or other group \nasset) account system actually used in computing the taxpayer's regulated expense. A \nmethod of reducing is ratable if the amount to reduce cost of service is allocated ratable \nin proportion to the number of such units. Thus, for example, assume that the regulated \ndepreciation expense is computed under the straight line method by applying a \ncomposite annual percentage rate to original cost (as defined for purposes of computing \ndepreciation expense). If cost of service is reduced annually by an amount computed by \napplying a composite annual percentage rate to the amount of the credit, cost of service \nis reduced by a ratable portion. If such composite annual percentage rate were revised \nfor purposes of computing depreciation expense beginning with a particular accounting \nperiod, the computation of ratable portion must also be revised beginning with such \nperiod. A composite annual percentage rate is determined solely by reference to the \nperiod of time actually used by the taxpayer in computing its regulated depreciation \nexpense without reduction for salvage or other items such as over and under accruals. \n \nThe method prescribed by section 1.46-6(g)(2) of the regulations for determining \nwhether the taxpayer's cost of service for ratemaking is reduced by more than a ratable \nportion of the investment tax credit depends upon correlating the credit with the \nregulatory depreciable useful life actually used for the property that generated the credit. \nThat the correlation must remain constant and current is illustrated by the requirement \nthat the ratable portion must be adjusted to reflect correspondingly any revision to the \ncomposite annual percentage rate applied for purposes of computing regulated \ndepreciation expense. \n \n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \nPLR-100960-07 \n \n \n6 \n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-----------------------, is also consistent with the normalization requirements of \u00a7 168(i)(9) \nand former \u00a7\u00a7 167(l) and 46(f) because it simply adjust rates based on the calculations \ndescribed above.   \n \nWe note that this ruling is based on representations of the anticipated effects of \nthe isolating provisions of the Permanent Rules and theoretical examples of how the \nprovisions discussed herein are expected to apply.  Thus its applicability is limited to \nsituations in which the effects of accelerated depreciation and ITC-related tax benefits \nare isolated to ensure that the effects of these tax benefits on current and deferred \ntaxes is consistent with the normalization requirements as represented.  While it \nappears that the Act and Permanent Rules are designed to preclude violation of the \nnormalization provisions, this ruling does not hold that, in its application, no \nnormalization violation is possible for any utility operating in State under these \nprovisions.   \n \nThis ruling is directed only to the taxpayer who requested it.

Treas. Reg. \u00a71.892-\n2T(c)(1)(ii).  The information submitted for consideration is substantially as set forth \nbelow. \n \nPursuant to the Act, State (a political subdivision of Country X) authorized the \nestablishment of Pension Plan to provide pension benefits to current and former \nmembers of Organization and their dependents and beneficiaries (\u201cPension Plan \nmembers\u201d).  Membership in Organization is reserved exclusively for Group A.   \n \nPursuant to Agreement 1, State and Organization established Trust to hold and invest \nthe assets of Pension Plan to provide pension benefits to Pension Plan members. Trust \nis an entity separate and distinct from State and Organization.  Trust invests in public \nand private equity and fixed income markets of Country X and other countries, including \nthe United States.  Trust is not subject to income taxes in either Country X or State.  \n \nPursuant to the terms of Agreement 2 between State and Organization, a joint board of \ntrustees (the Board) was established to administer Pension Plan and invest and \nmanage the assets of Trust in accordance with the provisions of the Act and Agreement \n1.  The operation and administration of Trust, including custody, investment, and \nmanagement of Trust, are the sole responsibility of Board.  The Board is comprised of Y \ntrustees.  State and Organization each appoint half of those trustees (State Trustees \nand Organization Trustees, respectively).  Any resolution of the Board requires a vote of \nthe majority of the trustees present, provided that there is a quorum and that at least \none State Trustee and one Organization Trustee have supported the resolution.  In the \ncase of a deadlock, Agreement 2 provides that an additional trustee is to be appointed \nby agreement between State and Organization.  If they cannot agree, Agreement 2 \nprovides a mechanism for the appointment of the additional trustee.  \n  \nSince the establishment of Trust, the majority of Trustees serving on the Board have \nbeen State employees or appointees of State.  Trust represents that at no time since \nthe establishment of Trust has more than two non-government employees served \ntogether on the Board at the same time. \n \nSection 892(a)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code excludes from gross income and \nexempts from U.S. federal income taxation certain income of foreign governments.  \nSuch excluded income includes only income received from investments in the United \nStates in stocks, bonds, or other domestic securities owned by such foreign \ngovernments; income received from financial instruments held in the execution of \ngovernmental financial or monetary policy; and interest on deposits in banks in the \nUnited States of monies belonging to such foreign governments.  The exclusion does \nnot apply to income derived from the conduct of any commercial activity, whether within \nor without the United States, or to income received directly or indirectly from or by a \n \nPLR-157470-05 \n \n3 \ncontrolled commercial entity or derived from the disposition of any interest in a \ncontrolled entity.  Section 892(a)(2)(A) of the Code. \n \nFor purposes of section 892 of the Code, the term \"foreign government\" means only the \nintegral parts or controlled entities of a foreign sovereign.  Temp. Treas. Reg. ' 1.892-\n2T(a)(1).  Temp. Treas. Reg. '1.892-2T(d) provides that the rules that apply to a foreign \nsovereign apply to political subdivisions of a foreign country.  A \"controlled entity\" is an \nentity that is separate in form from a foreign sovereign or otherwise constitutes a \nseparate juridical entity provided that: (i) it is wholly owned and controlled by the foreign \nsovereign, directly or indirectly, through one or more controlled entities; (ii) it is \norganized under the laws of the foreign sovereign by which it is owned; (iii) its net \nearnings are credited to its own account or to other accounts of the foreign sovereign, \nwith no portion of its income inuring to the benefit of any private person; and (iv) its \nassets vest in the foreign sovereign upon dissolution.  Temp. Treas. Reg. '1.892-\n2T(a)(3). \n \nTemp. Treas. Reg. '1.892-2T(c)(1) provides that a \u201ccontrolled entity\u201d includes a \nseparately organized pension trust that meets the following requirements: \n \n(i) \nThe trust is established exclusively for the benefit of (A) employees or former \nemployees of a foreign government or (B) employees or former employees of a \nforeign government and non-governmental employees or former employees that \nperform or performed governmental or social services; \n \n(ii) \nThe funds that comprise the trust are managed by trustees who are employees \nof, or persons appointed by, the foreign government; \n \n(iii) \nThe trust forming a part of the pension plan provides for retirement, disability, or \ndeath benefits in consideration for prior services rendered; and \n \n(iv) \nIncome of the trust satisfies the obligations of the foreign government to \nparticipants under the plan, rather than inuring to the benefit of a private person. \n \nBased solely upon the facts and representations submitted, in our opinion, as of \nNovember 2, 2005, Trust satisfied the requirement of Temp. Treas. Reg. \u00a71.892-\n2T(c)(1)(ii).  Accordingly, as of that date, the funds that comprised Trust were managed \nby persons who met the requirement of Temp. Treas. Reg. \u00a71.892-2T(c)(1)(ii).   \n \nThe ruling contained in this letter is based upon information and representations \nsubmitted by Trust and accompanied by a penalty of perjury statement executed by an \nappropriate party.  While this office has not verified any of the material submitted in \nsupport of the request for rulings, it is subject to verification on examination. \n \n \nPLR-157470-05 \n \n4 \nExcept as expressly provided herein, no opinion is expressed or implied concerning the \ntax consequences of any aspect of any transaction or item discussed or referenced in \nthis letter.  In particular, no opinion is expressed or implied as to whether: \n \n1. \nTrust satisfies the requirements of paragraphs (i), (iii), and (iv) of Temp. Treas. \nReg. \u00a71.892-2T(c)(1); \n \n2. \nWhether Trust is a \u201ccontrolled commercial entity\u201d as defined in section \n892(a)(2)(B) of the Code and Treas. Reg. \u00a71.892-5(a) and Temp. Treas. Reg. \n\u00a71.892-5T(a); and  \n \n3. \nWhether any U.S. source income received by Trust is exempt from U.S. federal \nincome tax under section 892(a)(1).   \n \nThis ruling is directed only to the taxpayer requesting it.  Section 6110(k)(3) of the Code \nprovides that it may not be used or cited as precedent. \n \nIn accordance with the Power of Attorney on file with this office, a copy of this letter is \nbeing sent to the first and second listed authorized representatives. \n \n \nSincerely, \n \n \n \nRichard L.

The information \nsubmitted in that letter and in later correspondence is summarized below. \n \nThe rulings contained in this letter are based on facts and representations \nsubmitted by the taxpayer and accompanied by penalty of perjury statements executed \nby the appropriate parties.  This office has not verified any of the materials submitted in \nthe support of the request for rulings.  Verification of the information, representations, \nand other data may be required as part of the audit process.  In particular, this office \nhas not reviewed any information pertaining to, and has made no determination \nregarding, whether the Share Distribution (defined below): (i) satisfies the business \npurpose requirement of \u00a7 1.355-2(b) of the Income Tax Regulations, (ii) is being used \nprincipally as a device for the distribution of earnings and profits of the distributing or \ncontrolled corporation or both (see \u00a7 355(a)(1)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code (the \n\u201cCode\u201d) and  \u00a7 1.355-2(d)), or (iii) is part of a plan (or series of related transactions) \npursuant to which one or more persons will acquire directly or indirectly stock \nrepresenting a 50 percent or greater interest in the distributing or controlled corporation \n(see  \u00a7 355(e) and \u00a7 1.355-7).  \n \nSummary of Facts \n \nOld Parent is the publicly-traded common parent of an affiliated group of \ncorporations that file a consolidated federal income tax return.  Old Parent has a single \nclass of common stock outstanding, and management believes that A is the only \nshareholder who owns five percent or more of this stock.  \n \n \nOld Parent wholly owns Sub 1 (which engages in Business A), Sub 2 (which \nengages in Business B) and various other subsidiaries, trusts, and limited liability \ncompanies.  Old Parent also owns all of the common stock of Distributing, the only class \nof stock Distributing currently has outstanding.  Distributing wholly owns Merger Sub \nand Controlled.  Controlled has outstanding a single class of common stock.  \nDistributing, Merger Sub, and Controlled were each created in anticipation of the \nproposed transactions described below.  All of the above mentioned entities are \ndomestic. \n \nFinancial information has been submitted which indicates that Business A \n(directly conducted by Sub 1) and Business B (directly conducted by Sub 2) each has \nhad gross receipts and operating expenses representing the active conduct of a trade or \nbusiness for each of the past five years.  \n \n \nPLR-124044-07 \n \n \n4 \nThe Proposed Transactions \n \nFor what are represented to be valid business reasons, the following transactions \nhave been proposed (collectively, the \u201cProposed Transactions\u201d): \n(i)  Merger Sub will merge into Old Parent (the \u201cOld Parent Merger\u201d).  In the Old \nParent Merger, every a issued and outstanding shares of Old Parent common stock will \nautomatically convert into b shares of common stock of Distributing.  Holders of Old \nParent common stock that would otherwise be entitled to receive fractional shares of \nDistributing common stock will be paid cash in lieu of such fractional shares.  As a result \nof the Old Parent Merger, Old Parent will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of \nDistributing and Distributing will become the publicly-traded parent of the group.   \n(ii)  Immediately following the Old Parent Merger, Old Parent will be converted \ninto a limited liability company (\u201cOld Parent LLC\u201d) that will be wholly owned by \nDistributing (the \u201cOld Parent Conversion\u201d). \n(iii)  Old Parent LLC will distribute all of the shares of common stock of Sub 2 to \nDistributing.  \n(iv)  Pursuant to an Investment Agreement, Investor will acquire (the \u201cShare \nIssuance\u201d) a number of newly issued shares of Class A common stock of Distributing \n(the \u201cDistributing Class A Common Stock\u201d).  The Distributing Class A Common Stock \nwill be automatically convertible into Distributing common stock that will represent \napproximately c% of the Distributing common stock upon the share conversion \ndescribed in step (ix) below. \n(v)  Distributing or one or more of its subsidiaries are expected to incur \napproximately $d of indebtedness from third-party sources.  \n(vi)  Distributing or its subsidiaries will pay off certain intercompany indebtedness \nplus accrued and unpaid interest owed to Old Parent.  Sub 2 will then make a \ndistribution or loan of cash to Distributing.  Following this step and the preceding step, \nDistributing will have approximately $e in cash (not including cash held by Old Parent).   \n(vii)  Distributing will contribute all of the membership interests of Old Parent LLC \nand approximately $e of cash to Controlled (the \u201cContribution\u201d).  \n (viii)  Distributing will distribute on a pro rata basis to holders of record of \nDistributing common stock (other than Investor), all of its Controlled common stock (the \n\u201cShare Distribution\u201d). \n(ix)  The Distributing Class A Common Stock will automatically convert into \nDistributing common stock on a day subsequent to the Share Distribution. \n \nPLR-124044-07 \n \n \n5 \n \nThe By-Laws of Distributing provide that the initial Distributing board will consist \nof f directors, g of whom will be designated by Investor and g of whom are designated \nby name or title.  The remaining directors will be selected by Old Parent after certain \nconsultations are undertaken and consents (which will not be unreasonably withheld or \ndelayed) acquired.  Pursuant to a Shareholder\u2019s Agreement with Investor, until the \nearlier of the h year anniversary of the closing date and the termination of the \nShareholder\u2019s Agreement, if Investor owns at least i% of the outstanding common stock \nof Distributing, it will have the right to nominate g directors to stand for election; if \nInvestor's ownership percentage is between i% and j%, k directors; if the ownership \npercentage is less than j%, but the fair market value of its Distributing stock equals or \nexceeds $l, m directors; and if the fair market value is less than $l, Investor shall not \nhave the right to nominate any directors.  Any directors so nominated by Investor must \nstill stand for election and be voted upon by all of the Distributing shareholders.  Each \nshare of Distributing common stock, whether owned by Investor or by the public, has \nidentical rights with respect to voting for directors.   \n \nOld Parent has a share repurchase program that gives it the ability to purchase \nannually up to n shares of its issued and outstanding common stock (the \u201cShare \nRepurchase Program\u201d).  As part of the Share Repurchase Program, Old Parent \nrepurchased o shares on Date 1 and a total of p shares between Date 2 and Date 3 \nthrough accelerated share repurchase agreements (the \u201cAccelerated Share \nRepurchases\u201d).   \n \nIn connection with the Proposed Transactions, Controlled and its affiliates (the \n\"Controlled Group\") will enter into agreements with Distributing and its affiliates (the \n\u201cDistributing Group\u201d) for: (i) transitional arrangements; (ii) tax sharing and allocations; \n(iii) certain other contractual relationships, including (1) contractual relationships \nwhereby members of the Distributing Group provide services to members of the \nControlled Group with respect to Business B and whereby members of the Controlled \nGroup provide services to members of the Distributing Group with respect to Business \nA; and (2) contractual relationships regarding referral arrangements. \nRepresentations \nThe following representations have been made regarding the Old Parent Merger \nand the Old Parent Conversion: \n(a)  The fair market value of the shares of Distributing common stock and other \nconsideration received by each Old Parent shareholder will be approximately equal to \nthe fair market value of the Old Parent stock surrendered in the exchange. \n(b)  Immediately following consummation of the Old Parent Merger and the Old \nParent Conversion, and prior to the Share Issuance, the shareholders of Old Parent will \nown all of the outstanding Distributing stock and will own such stock solely by reason of \ntheir ownership of Old Parent stock immediately prior to the transaction. \n \nPLR-124044-07 \n \n \n6 \n(c)  Other than pursuant to the Share Issuance and possible acquisitions to be \nnegotiated after the Distribution Date, Distributing has no plan or intention to issue \nadditional shares of its stock following the Old Parent Merger and the Old Parent \nConversion. \n(d)  Immediately following consummation of the Old Parent Merger and the Old \nParent Conversion, and prior to the Contribution, Distributing (through Old Parent LLC) \nwill possess the same assets and liabilities, except for assets used to pay expenses \nincurred in connection with the transaction, as those possessed by Old Parent \nimmediately prior to the transaction.  Assets used to pay expenses, and all redemptions \nand distributions (except for regular, normal dividends and stock buybacks under the \nShare Repurchase Program) made by Old Parent immediately preceding the \ntransaction will, in the aggregate, constitute less than one percent of the net assets of \nOld Parent.  \n(e)  At the time of the Old Parent Merger and the Old Parent Conversion, Old \nParent will not have outstanding any warrants, options, convertible securities, or any \nother type of right pursuant to which any person could acquire stock in Old Parent. \n(f)  The liabilities of Old Parent assumed by Distributing plus the liabilities, if any, \nto which the transferred assets are subject were incurred by Old Parent in the ordinary \ncourse of its business and are associated with the assets transferred. \n(g)  The Old Parent shareholders will pay their respective expenses, if any, \nincurred in connection with the Old Parent Merger and the Old Parent Conversion. \n(h)  Old Parent is not under the jurisdiction of a court in a Title 11 or similar case \nwithin the meaning of \u00a7 368(a)(3)(A). \n(i)  The payment of cash in lieu of a fractional share of Distributing stock is solely \nfor the purpose of avoiding the expense and inconvenience of issuing and maintaining \nfractional shares and will not represent separately bargained for consideration. The total \ncash that will be paid in the transaction to any shareholder in lieu of a fractional share of \nDistributing stock will not exceed one percent of the total consideration that will be \ndistributed in the transaction.   \nThe following representations have been submitted regarding the Contribution \nand the Share Distribution:  \n (j)  No part of the consideration to be distributed by Distributing will be received \nby a shareholder as a creditor, employee, or in any capacity other than that of a \nshareholder of the corporation. \n (k)  The Share Distribution is being carried out for the following corporate \nbusiness purposes: to eliminate the competition for capital between Business A and \n \nPLR-124044-07 \n \n \n7 \nBusiness B; to provide both businesses with an enhanced acquisition currency; and to \nraise capital by facilitating the investment by Investor.  The Share Distribution is \nmotivated, in whole or substantial part, by one or more of these corporate business \npurposes. \n(l)  The transaction is not used principally as a device for the distribution of \nearnings and profits of Distributing or Controlled or both.  \n(m)  The income tax liability for the taxable year  in which investment credit \nproperty (including any building to which  \u00a7 47(d) applies) is transferred will be adjusted \npursuant to \u00a7 50(a)(1) or  (a)(2) (or \u00a7 47, as in effect before amendment by Public Law \n101-508,  Title 11, 104 Stat. 1388, 536 (1990), if applicable) to reflect an early \ndisposition of the property. \n(n)  No two parties to the transaction are investment companies as defined in      \n\u00a7 368(a)(2)(F)(iii) and (iv). \n(o)  The Share Distribution is not part of a plan or series of related transactions \n(within the meaning of \u00a7 1.355-7) pursuant to which one or more persons will acquire \ndirectly or indirectly stock representing a 50 percent or greater interest (within the \nmeaning of \u00a7 355(d)(4)) in Distributing or Controlled (including any predecessor or \nsuccessor of any such corporation). \n(p)  All repurchases of stock by Old Parent prior to the date of the Share \nDistribution were not related to the Proposed Transactions, and the total amount of \nshares Old Parent was authorized to repurchase would have been the same regardless \nof the Proposed Transactions. \n(q)  Other than discussions with investment banks about facilitating open market \npurchases pursuant to accelerated share repurchase programs, there was no \nagreement, understanding, arrangement, or substantial negotiations within the meaning \nof \u00a7 1.355-7(h)(1) with respect to the stock repurchases that occurred  pursuant to Old \nParent\u2019s Share Repurchase Program. \n(r)  Immediately before the Share Distribution, items of income, gain, loss, \ndeduction, and credit will be taken into account as required by the applicable \nintercompany transaction regulations (see \u00a7 1.1502-13 and \u00a7 1.1502-14 as in effect \nbefore the publication of T.D. 8597, 1995-2 C.B. 147, and as currently in effect;             \n\u00a7 1.1502-13 as published by T.D. 8597).  Further, Distributing\u2019s excess loss account, if \nany, with respect to the Controlled stock (or the excess loss account that a member \nmay have in the stock of another member that is required to be taken into account by    \n\u00a7 1.1502-19) will be included in income immediately before the Share Distribution to the \nextent required by regulations (see  \u00a7 1.1502-19). \n \nPLR-124044-07 \n \n \n8 \n(s)  The total adjusted bases and fair market value of the assets transferred to \nControlled by Distributing in the Contribution each equals or exceeds the sum of the \nliabilities assumed (within the meaning of  \u00a7 357(d)) by Controlled plus any liabilities to \nwhich the transferred assets are subject. \n(t)  The liabilities assumed (within the meaning of \u00a7 357(d)) by Controlled in the \nContribution and the liabilities to which the transferred assets are subject were incurred \nin the ordinary course of business and are associated with the assets being transferred. \n(u)  Immediately after the transaction (as defined in \u00a7 355(g)(4)), either (1) no \nperson will hold a 50-percent or greater interest (within the meaning of \u00a7 355(g)(3)) in \nDistributing or Controlled, (2) if any person holds a 50-percent or greater interest (within \nthe meaning of \u00a7 355(g)(3)) in any disqualified investment corporation (within the \nmeaning of \u00a7 355(g)(2)), such person will have held such interest in such corporation \nimmediately before the Proposed Transactions, or (3) Distributing and Controlled will \nnot be a disqualified investment corporation (within the meaning of \u00a7 355(g)(2)). \n(v)  For purposes of \u00a7 355(d), immediately after the Share Distribution, no person \n(determined after applying \u00a7 355(d)(7)) will hold stock possessing 50 percent or more of \nthe total combined voting power of all classes of Distributing stock entitled to vote, or 50 \npercent or more of the total value of shares of all classes of Distributing stock, that was \nacquired by purchase (as defined in \u00a7 355(d)(5) and (8)) during the five-year period \n(determined after applying \u00a7 355(d)(6)) ending on the date of the Share Distribution. \n(w)  For purposes of \u00a7 355(d), immediately after the Share Distribution, no \nperson (determined after applying \u00a7 355(d)(7)) will hold stock possessing 50 percent or \nmore of the total combined voting power of all classes of Controlled stock entitled to \nvote, or 50 percent or more of the total value of shares of all classes of Controlled stock, \nthat was either (i) acquired by purchase (as defined in \u00a7 355(d)(5) and (8)) during the \nfive-year period (determined after applying \u00a7 355(d)(6)) ending on the date of the Share \nDistribution, or (ii) attributable to distributions on Distributing stock or securities that \nwere acquired by purchase (as defined in \u00a7 355(d)(5) and (8)) during the five year-\nperiod (determined after applying \u00a7 355(d)(6)) ending on the date of the Share \nDistribution. \n(x)  Payments made in connection with all continuing transactions, if any, \nbetween Distributing (and its affiliates) and Controlled (and its affiliates) will be for fair \nmarket value based on terms and conditions arrived at by the parties bargaining at \narm\u2019s length. \n(y)  Any debt owed by Controlled to Distributing after the Share Distribution will \nnot constitute stock or securities. \n(z)  Distributing and Controlled each will elect under \u00a7 355(b)(3)(C) to treat all \nmembers of its separate affiliated group (\"SAG\" as defined in \u00a7 355(b)(3)(B)) as one \n \nPLR-124044-07 \n \n \n9 \ncorporation in determining whether it meets the requirement of \u00a7 355(b)(2)(A) regarding \nactive conduct of a trade or business. \n(aa)  The five years of financial information submitted on behalf of the businesses \nconducted by Sub 2 (a member of the Distributing SAG) and by Sub 1 (a member of the \nControlled SAG) is representative of the present operations of each business, and there \nhave been no substantial operational changes in either business since the date of the \nlast financial statements submitted.  Sub 2 is, and following the Share Distribution, will \nbe affiliated with Distributing in a manner that satisfies \u00a7 1504(a), without regard to        \n\u00a7 1504(b).  At the time of and following the Share Distribution, Sub 1 will be affiliated \nwith Controlled in a manner that satisfies \u00a7 1504(a), without regard to \u00a7 1504(b). \n(bb)  Following the Share Distribution, the Distributing SAG and the Controlled \nSAG will each continue the active conduct of its respective businesses, independently \nand with its own employees. \n  \nRulings  \nBased solely on the information submitted and representations made, we rule as \nfollows regarding the Old Parent Merger and the Old Parent Conversion: \n(1)  The Old Parent Merger, together with the Old Parent Conversion, will qualify \nas a reorganization under \u00a7 368(a)(1)(F). Old Parent and Distributing will each be \u201ca \nparty to a reorganization\u201d under \u00a7 368(b). \n(2)  No gain or loss will be recognized by an Old Parent shareholder solely as the \nresult of the receipt of Distributing common stock in the Old Parent Merger, except with \nrespect to cash received in lieu of fractional shares (\u00a7 354(a)). \n(3)  An Old Parent shareholder who receives cash in lieu of fractional shares of \nDistributing common stock will recognize gain or loss equal to the difference between \nthe amount of cash received and the basis of the Old Parent common stock allocable to \nthe fractional share interest (Rev. Rul. 66-365, 1966-2 C.B. 116; Rev. Proc. 77-41, \n1977-2 C.B. 574). \n(4)  No gain or loss will be recognized by Old Parent in the Old Parent Merger \nand the Old Parent Conversion (\u00a7\u00a7 361(a) and 357(a)). \n(5)  No gain or loss will be recognized by Distributing in the Old Parent Merger \nand the Old Parent Conversion (\u00a7 1032(a)). \n(6)  The basis of each asset of Old Parent in the hands of Distributing will be the \nsame as the basis of that asset in the hands of Old Parent immediately prior to its \ntransfer (\u00a7 362(b)). \n \nPLR-124044-07 \n \n \n10 \n(7)  The holding period of each Old Parent asset held by Distributing will include \nthe period during which the asset was held by Old Parent (\u00a7 1223(2)). \n(8)  The aggregate tax basis of the Distributing common stock that an Old Parent \nshareholder receives in the Old Parent Merger will be the same as the aggregate tax \nbasis of the shares of Old Parent common stock converted into shares of Distributing \ncommon stock, decreased by the amount of any tax basis allocable to any fractional \nshare interest in Distributing common stock for which cash is received (\u00a7 358(a)(1)). \n(9)  The holding period of the Distributing common stock received by an Old \nParent shareholder in the Old Parent Merger will include the holding period of the \nshareholder\u2019s Old Parent common stock, provided that the Old Parent common stock is \nheld as a capital asset on the date of the Old Parent Merger (\u00a7 1223(1)). \n(10)  The tax year of the affiliated group of Old Parent will not end on the date of \nthe Old Parent Merger and such tax year will continue with Distributing as the successor \nto Old Parent in its capacity as the common parent of the affiliated group of corporations \nof which Old Parent was the common parent (\u00a7\u00a7 1.381(b)-1(a)(2) and 1.1502-\n75(d)(2)(i)). \nBased solely on the information submitted and representations made, we rule as \nfollows regarding the Contribution and the Share Distribution: \n(11)  The Contribution, together with the Share Distribution, will be a \nreorganization under \u00a7 368(a)(1)(D).  Distributing and Controlled will each be a \u201cparty to \na reorganization\u201d under \u00a7 368(b). \n(12)  No gain or loss will be recognized by Distributing in the Contribution          \n(\u00a7\u00a7 361(a) and 357(a)). \n(13)  No gain or loss will be recognized by Controlled in the Contribution            \n(\u00a7 1032(a)). \n(14)  Controlled\u2019s basis in each asset received from Distributing will equal the \nbasis of that asset in the hands of Distributing immediately before its transfer (\u00a7 362(b)).   \n(15)  The holding period of each asset received by Controlled will include the \nperiod during which such asset was held by Distributing (\u00a7 1223(2)). \n(16)  No gain or loss will be recognized by (and no amount will otherwise be \nincluded in the income of) the Distributing shareholders on their receipt of the Controlled \nstock in the Share Distribution (\u00a7 355(a)(1)). \n(17)  No gain or loss will be recognized by Distributing in the Share Distribution   \n(\u00a7 361(c)). \n \nPLR-124044-07 \n \n \n11 \n(18)  The aggregate tax basis of the Controlled stock and the Distributing stock in \nthe hands of the Distributing shareholders will be the same as the aggregate tax basis \nof the Distributing stock held by such holders immediately before the Share Distribution \nallocated in proportion to the fair market value of each (\u00a7 358(a)(1) and (b) and \u00a7 1.358-\n2(a)).  If a Distributing shareholder that purchased or acquired shares of Distributing \nstock on different dates or at different prices is not able to identify which particular share \nof Controlled stock is received with respect to a particular share of Distributing stock, \nthe shareholder may designate which share of Controlled stock is received with respect \nto a particular share of Distributing stock, provided the terms of the designation are \nconsistent with the terms of the Share Distribution. \n(19)  Assuming that the shares of Distributing stock held by each Distributing \nshareholder are capital assets in the hands of such shareholder, the holding period of \nthe Controlled stock received by the Distributing shareholder will include the holding \nperiod for the Distributing stock on which the distribution is made (i.e., the shareholder\u2019s \nholding period for the Old Parent common stock from which his or her shares of \nDistributing stock were converted in the Old Parent Merger) (\u00a7 1223(1)). \n(20)  No gain or loss will be recognized by and no amount will be included in the \nincome of Investor upon the conversion of its shares of Distributing Class A Common \nStock into Distributing common stock (\u00a7 1036(a)). \n(21)  The initial designation of directors for the Distributing Board and the \ngovernance arrangements set forth in the Shareholder\u2019s Agreement and the Distributing \nBy-Laws will not be taken into account for purposes of the \u00a7 355(d) and \u00a7 355(e) \nanalyses. \n(22)  The Share Repurchase Program (including the Accelerated Share \nRepurchases) will not have any effect on the determination of whether there has been \nan acquisition of a 50 percent or greater interest in Distributing (i.e., the share \nrepurchases will not affect the determination of the percentage of the total combined \nvoting power or value of Distributing stock acquired within the meaning of \u00a7 355(e)). \n(23)  As provided in \u00a7 312(h), proper allocation of earnings and profits between \nDistributing and Controlled will be made under \u00a7\u00a7 1.312-10(a) and 1.1502-33. \nCaveats \nWe express no opinion about the tax treatment of the Proposed Transactions \nunder other provisions of the Code and regulations or the tax treatment of any \nconditions existing at the time of, or effects resulting from, the Proposed Transactions \nthat are not specifically covered by the above rulings. In particular, we express no  \nopinion regarding: \n \nPLR-124044-07 \n \n \n12 \n(i) Whether the Share Distribution satisfies the business purpose requirement of \n\u00a7 1.355-2(b); \n(ii) Whether the Share Distribution is being used principally as a device for the \ndistribution of the earnings and profits of Distributing or Controlled (see \u00a7 355(a)(1)(B) \nand \u00a7 1.355-2(d)); \n(iii)  Whether the Share Distribution is part of a plan (or series of related \ntransactions) pursuant to which one or more persons will acquire directly or indirectly \nstock representing a 50 percent or greater interest in Distributing or Controlled (see       \n\u00a7 355(e) and \u00a7 1.355-7); and \n(iv)  The federal income tax treatment of any cash distributed by Sub 2 to \nDistributing (as described in step (vi) above). \n \n \n \n \n \nProcedural Matters \nThis ruling letter is directed only to the taxpayers who requested it.  Section \n6110(k)(3) provides that it may not be used or cited as precedent. \n \nA copy of this ruling letter must be attached to any federal income tax return to \nwhich it is relevant.

As part of its business, Taxpayer issues individual and\ngroup annuity contracts based on separate asset accounts.   Two of its separate\naccounts are Account 1 and Account 2.  The contracts at issue in this ruling are certain\ngroup annuity contracts based on Account 1 and certain group annuity contracts based\non Account 2 (hereinafter collectively referred to as the \u201cContracts\u201d).  Taxpayer intends\nto issue the Contracts to certain tax-exempt organizations, such as universities and\nprivate foundations.  \nAccount 1 and Account 2 were established by the Taxpayer pursuant to state\nlaw.   Account 1 and Account 2 are pooled, open-end, separate accounts to which\ngains or losses, realized or unrealized on assets held, will be credited or charged\nwithout regard to any other income, gains, or losses of the Taxpayer.  Amounts\nincluded in Account 1 and Account 2 are owned by the Taxpayer, and the Taxpayer is\nnot a trustee as to these amounts.  Under no circumstances will deposits to Account 1\nor Account 2, or income, gains, or losses in Account 1 or Account 2, be credited or\ncharged to Taxpayer's general account.  Additionally, no amounts will be transferred\nfrom Taxpayer's general account to Account 1 or Account 2. \nAccount 1 and Account 2 are managed by Taxpayer through an operating unit of\nTaxpayer.  Amounts allocated to Account 1 and Account 2 are invested and reinvested\nin such manner as the managers of such Account deem appropriate.  The assets of\nAccount 1 are invested primarily in existing, income-producing properties.  Investments\n2\nin Account 1 are made through direct property ownership, or indirectly through such\nvehicles as joint ventures, general or limited partnerships, limited liability companies,\nmortgage loans and other loan types, and debt secured by an interest in the borrowing\nentity or interests in companies or entities that directly or indirectly hold real estate or\nreal estate interests.  Account 2 is a real estate portfolio designed for long-term\ninvestment in real estate within the United States.  Account 2 investments include\napartments, office buildings, and retail properties.  Taxpayer represents that the\ninvestments made by Account 1 and Account 2 are \u201cadequately diversified\u201d within the\nmeaning of section 817(h) and the regulations thereunder. \nA Contract-holder may at any time direct Taxpayer to provide payment of \u201clife,\u201d\n\u201cstated amount,\u201d or \u201cstated period\u201d annuities with respect to the amounts held under the\nContract.  The purchase price of each annuity will be determined from the annuity\npurchase rate schedule guaranteed under, and set forth in, the Contract.  Guarantees\nmay not be changed except with respect to future considerations received under the\nContract.  For each type of annuity, the total amount payable can be determined when\nannuity payments begin.  Amounts are payable in periodic installments at regular\nintervals over a period of more than one full year from the date that payments begin,\nand the total amount payable is determinable, directly or indirectly, as of the date the\npayments begin.  \nUnder the Contracts, the amounts paid out to the Contract-holders reflect the\ninvestment return and market value of the segregated accounts.  Thus, Contract-\nholders participate in the favorable and unfavorable market performance of the\nsegregated accounts.  Taxpayer will separately account for various income, exclusion,\ndeduction, asset, reserve, and other liability items properly attributable to the Contracts. \nThe Contracts provide for required distributions upon the death of a primary\nannuitant.   In the event a primary annuitant dies before the date annuity payments are\ndue to begin, all amounts will be liquidated and distributed to the Contract-holder within\nfive years following the primary annuitant's death.  In the event a primary annuitant dies\non or after the date the payments have begun, but have not yet been completed,\ndistributions of the remaining amounts payable must be made at least as rapidly as the\nrate that was being used at the date of death.\nLAW AND ANALYSIS\nSection 817(d) defines a \u201cvariable contract\u201d as a contract that provides for the\nallocation of all or part of the amounts received under the contract to an account that,\npursuant to state law or regulation, is segregated from the general asset accounts of\nthe company and that provides for the payment of annuities, or is a life insurance\ncontract.  Section 817(d)(1) and (2).  In the case of an annuity contract, the amounts\npaid in or the amounts paid out reflect the investment return and market value of the\nsegregated asset account.  Section 817(d)(3)(A).  If a contract ceases to reflect current\ninvestment return and current market value, it will not be considered a variable contract\n3\nafter such cessation.  Section 817(d).\nAmounts received under the group annuity contract are allocated to Account 1 or\nAccount 2 which, under state law, are segregated from the Taxpayer\u2019s general asset\naccount.  Therefore, the Contracts meet the requirements set forth in section 817(d)(1). \nBecause the Contracts are not life insurance contracts, they must provide for the\npayment of annuities.  See section 817(d)(2)(A).  As section 817 does not define the\nphrase \u201cprovides for the payment of annuities,\u201d it is necessary to look to the guidelines\nin section 1.72-2(b)(1) and (2) of the Income Tax Regulations, which relate to the\namounts received under an annuity contract as \u201camounts received as an annuity.\u201d \nSection 1.72-2(b)(2) provides that amounts are considered to be \u201camounts received as\nan annuity\u201d only if they are received on or after the \u201cannuity starting date\u201d as that term is\ndefined in section 1.72-4(b); they are payable in periodic installments at regular\nintervals over a period of more than one full year from the annuity starting date; and\nwith an exception not here relevant, the total amount payable is determinable as of the\nannuity starting date either directly from the terms of the contract or indirectly by the use\nof either mortality tables or compound interest computations, or both.  See also section\n72(j) (interest payments received under an agreement to pay interest on any amount\nwill be included in gross income, and thus will not be subject to the exclusion ratio\napplicable to amounts received as an annuity).  The facts, as stated above, indicate\nthat the amounts under the Contracts are not held under an agreement to pay interest\nthereon and are payable in periodic installments at regular intervals over a period of\nmore than one full year from the date that payments begin and that the total amount\npayable is determinable, directly or indirectly, as of the date the payments begin. \nTherefore, the Contracts meet the requirement of section 817(d)(2)(A) that it provide for\nthe payment of annuities. \nSection 72(u)(1)(A) provides that an annuity contract that is held by a person\nwho is not a natural person will not be treated as an annuity contract for purposes of\nsubtitle A of the Code (other than for purposes of subchapter L).  Although the\nContracts are held by persons who are not natural persons, the Contracts are annuity\ncontracts for purposes of subchapter L of the Code, which includes section 817(d).  See\nsection 72(u)(1)(A).  In view of the Contracts\u2019 status as annuity contracts under\nsubchapter L, the tax treatment of a Contract-holder under section 72(u)(1)(A) does not\npreclude the Contract from satisfying the requirements of section 817(d)(2)(A) for\npurposes of determining Taxpayer's income. \nIn order to be a variable contract, a Contract must also satisfy the requirements\nof section 817(d)(3).  In the case of an annuity contract, including a contract described\nin section 72 (u)(1), section 817(d)(3) requires that amounts paid in or the amounts paid\nout reflect the investment return and the market value of the segregated asset account. \nUnder the Contracts, the amounts paid out reflect the investment return and market\nvalue of the segregated account. \n4\nAccordingly, based on the facts and representations set forth above, the\nContracts satisfy the requirements of section 817(d)(1)-(3), and are thus \u201cvariable\ncontracts,\u201d as that term is defined in section 817(d). \nNo opinion is expressed as to the tax treatment of the transaction under the\nprovisions of any other section of the Code or regulations, or to the tax treatment of any\nconditions existing at the time of, or effects resulting from, the transaction that are not\nspecifically covered by the above ruling.  \nThis ruling letter is directed only to the taxpayer who requested it.  Section\n6110(k)(3) provides that it may not be used or cited as precedent. \nThe rulings contained in this letter are based upon information and\nrepresentations submitted by the Taxpayer and accompanied by a penalty of perjury\nstatement executed by an appropriate party.  While this office has not verified any of\nthe material submitted in support of the request for rulings, it is subject to verification on\nexamination. \nSincerely yours,\nDONALD J.

Sub 1 wholly owns Sub 2, which \nwholly owns Sub 3.  Sub 1, Sub 2, and Sub 3 are Country Y corporations.  \nDistributing, a domestic corporation, is common parent of an affiliated group of \ncorporations that files a consolidated federal income tax return on a calendar-year \nbasis.  Distributing conducts Business A through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Sub 4.  \nPLR-100732-08\n3\nDistributing also wholly owns Controlled, a domestic corporation that conducts Business \nB. \nFinancial information has been submitted indicating that Business A (as \nconducted by Sub 4) and Business B (as conducted by Controlled) each has had gross \nreceipts and operating expenses representing the active conduct of a trade or business \nfor each of the past five years preceding the proposed transaction.\nDistributing management has determined that the proposed transaction will serve \nthe corporate business purpose of fit and focus.  \nProposed Transaction\nIn order to achieve the corporate business purpose, Distributing has proposed \nthe following transaction (the \u201cProposed Transaction\u201d): \n(i)\nDistributing will contribute to Controlled certain assets related to \nControlled\u2019s Business B in constructive exchange for additional Controlled \nstock and Controlled\u2019s assumption of liabilities related to the transferred \nassets (the \u201cContribution\u201d).\n(ii)\nDistributing will distribute all of the Controlled stock to Parent (the \n\u201cDistribution\u201d).\n(iii)\nParent will transfer the Controlled stock to Sub 1 (the \u201cPost-Spin \nContribution 1\u201d).\n(iv)\nSub 1 will transfer the Controlled stock to Sub 2 (the \u201cPost-Spin \nContribution 2\u201d).\n(v)\nSub 2 will transfer the Controlled stock to Sub 3 (the \u201cPost-Spin \nContribution 3\u201d).

The material information submitted in that \nletter and in subsequent correspondence is summarized below.\nForeign Corporation, a Country X corporation and holding company, owns all the \nstock of Parent.  Parent, a State Y corporation and holding company, owns all the stock \nof Sub1.  Sub1, a State Y corporation and holding company, owns all the stock of Sub2.  \nSub2 is a domestic corporation engaged in Business A.  Parent is the common parent \nof an affiliated group of corporations filing a consolidated Federal income tax return.\nTarget, a State Z corporation, is also engaged in Business A and was not related \nto Foreign Corporation, Parent, Sub1, or Sub2.\nIn the last several years, Foreign Corporation embarked on a growth strategy \nthat involved expanding into other geographic areas.  As part of this strategy, Foreign \nCorporation entered into an Agreement with Target on Date 1 to acquire Target in a \ntransaction that was intended to qualify as a reorganization under sections 368(a)(1)(A) \nand 368(a)(2)(D) of the Internal Revenue Code.  To effectuate the acquisition, Foreign \nCorporation formed Merger Sub, a domestic corporation.  On Date 2, Target merged \nwith and into Merger Sub with Merger Sub surviving.  In the merger, Target \nshareholders exchanged their Target stock solely for Foreign Corporation stock.  On \nDate 2, Foreign Corporation contributed Merger Sub to Parent and Parent, in turn, \ncontributed Merger Sub to Sub1.\nPLR-125004-08\n3\nAfter Date 2, there were unforeseeable significant changes in the economic and \nbusiness climate that adversely affected Business A.  To enable Merger Sub to keep its \nbusiness operations viable and due to regulatory, business, and economic constraints, \ntaxpayer proposes to merge Merger Sub into Sub2 under section 368(a)(1)(A).\nThe following representations have been made regarding the initial transaction \nand the proposed transaction:\n(a)\nThe merger of Target with and into Merger Sub qualified as a \nreorganization under sections 368(a)(1)(A) and 368(a)(2)(D).  This \nstructure for the transaction was chosen to avoid duplicative regulatory \nrequirements.\n(b)\nPrior to and on Date 2, neither Foreign Corporation nor any affiliate of \nForeign Corporation had a plan or intention to merge Merger Sub into \nSub2 or out of legal existence.  The need to merge Merger Sub into Sub2 \nhas arisen due to unexpected non-tax business reasons, and resolution of \nthese issues cannot be effectively accomplished by merging Sub2 into \nMerger Sub.\n(c)\nMerger Sub and Sub2 will qualify as domestic corporations for Federal \nincome tax purposes on the date of the proposed transaction.\n(d)\nThe fair market value of the Sub2 stock and other consideration received \nby Sub1 will be approximately equal to the fair market value of the Merger \nSub stock surrendered in exchange therefor.\n(e)\nAt least b percent of the proprietary interest in Merger Sub will be \nexchanged for Sub2 common stock and will be preserved (within the \nmeaning of \u00a71.368-1(e) of the Income Tax Regulations).  For purposes of \nthis representation, stock is not treated as a proprietary interest to the \nextent that no consideration is exchanged for it. \n(f)\nNeither Sub2 nor any person related to Sub2 (within the meaning of \n\u00a71.368-1(e)(3)) has any plan or intention to reacquire any of the Sub2 \nstock issued in the proposed merger.\n(g)\nSub2 has no plan or intention to sell or otherwise dispose of any of the \nassets of Merger Sub acquired in the transaction, except for dispositions \nmade in the ordinary course of business or transfers described in section \n386(a)(2)(C).\nPLR-125004-08\n4\n(h)\nThe liabilities of Merger Sub assumed by Sub2 and the liabilities to which \nthe transferred assets of Merger Sub are subject were incurred by Merger \nSub in the ordinary course of its business.\n(i)\nFollowing the transaction, Sub2 will continue the historic business of \nMerger Sub or use a significant portion of Merger Sub\u2019s historic business \nassets in a business.\n(j)\nSub1, Sub2, and Merger Sub will pay their respective expenses, if any, \nincurred in connection with the transaction.\n(k)\nThere is no intercorporate indebtedness existing between Merger Sub and \nSub2 that was issued, acquired, or will be settled at a discount.\n(l)\nNo two parties to the transaction are investment companies as defined in \nsection 368(a)(2)(F)(iii) and (iv).\n(m)\nMerger Sub is not under the jurisdiction of a court in a title 11 or similar \ncase within the meaning of section 368(a)(3)(A).\n(n)\nThe fair market value of the assets of Merger Sub transferred to Sub2 will \nequal or exceed the sum of the liabilities assumed by Sub2 plus the \namount of liabilities, if any, to which the transferred assets are subject.\nBased solely on the information submitted and the representations set forth \nabove, we rule as follows with respect to the proposed transaction:\n(1)\nProvided that the proposed merger of Merger Sub with and into Sub2 \nqualifies as a statutory merger in accordance with applicable state law, the \ntransfer of all of Merger Sub assets to Sub2 in exchange for Sub2 stock \nand the assumption by Sub2 of Merger Sub liabilities, followed by the \ndistribution of Sub2 stock to Sub1 in complete liquidation of Merger Sub, \nwill constitute a reorganization under section 368(a)(1)(A).  Merger Sub \nand Sub2 each will be \"a party to the reorganization\u201d within the meaning of \nsection 368(b).\n(2)\nMerger Sub will not recognize any gain or loss on the transfer of its assets \nto Sub2 in exchange for Sub2 stock and the assumption of its liabilities by \nSub2 (sections 361(a) and 357(a)).\n(3)\nSub2 will not recognize any gain or loss upon receipt of the Merger Sub \nassets in exchange for Sub2 stock and the assumption of the liabilities of \nMerger Sub (section 1032(a)).\nPLR-125004-08\n5\n(4)\nSub2\u2019s basis in the assets received from Merger Sub will equal the basis \nof such assets in the hands of Merger Sub immediately before their \ntransfer to Sub2 (section 362(b)).\n(5)\nSub2\u2019s holding period in the assets received from Merger Sub will include \nthe period during which Merger Sub held the assets (section 1223(2)).\n(6)\nMerger Sub will not recognize any gain or loss on its distribution of the \nSub2 stock to Sub1 (section 361(c)(1)).\n(7)\nSub1 will not recognize any gain or loss upon the exchange of its Merger \nSub stock for Sub2 stock pursuant to the merger (section 354(a)(1)).\n(8)\nSub1\u2019s basis in Sub2 stock received in the merger will equal the basis of \nthe Merger Sub stock exchanged therefor (section 358(a)).\n(9)\nSub1\u2019s holding period in the Sub2 stock received in the proposed merger \nwill include the holding period of the Merger Sub stock surrendered in the \nexchange provided that Sub1 held such stock as a capital asset on the \ndate of the merger (section 1223(1)).\n(10)\nAlthough the proposed transaction is not described in \u00a71.368-2(k), the \ninitial acquisition of Target and the proposed merger of Merger Sub into \nSub2 will not be treated as a single transaction under the step transaction \ndoctrine because the taxpayer has provided sufficient information to \ndemonstrate that the two steps are not integrated parts of a single plan.  \nThus, If the merger of Target with and into Merger Sub qualified as a \nreorganization under sections 368(a)(1)(A) and 368(a)(2)(D), the proposed \nmerger of Merger Sub into Sub2 will not affect that qualification.\nNo opinion is expressed about the tax treatment of the proposed transaction \nunder other provisions of the Code or regulations or the tax treatment of any conditions \nexisting at the time of, or effects resulting from, the proposed transaction that are not \nspecifically covered by the above rulings.  Furthermore, no opinion is expressed about \nwhether the initial acquisition of Target qualified as a reorganization under sections \n368(a)(1)(A) and 368(a)(2)(D).\nThe rulings contained in this letter are based on facts and representations \nsubmitted by the taxpayer and accompanied by a penalty of perjury statement executed \nby an appropriate party.  This Office has not verified any of the materials submitted in \nsupport of the request for rulings.  Verification of the information, representations, or \nother data may be required as part of the audit process.\nPLR-125004-08\n6\nThis ruling letter is directed only to the taxpayers who request it.  Section \n6110(k)(3) provides that it may not be used or cited as precedent.\nA copy of this letter must be attached to any Federal income tax return to which it \nis relevant.  Alternatively, taxpayers filing their returns electronically may satisfy this \nrequirement by attaching a statement to their return that provides the date and control \nnumber of this ruling letter.\nUnder a power of attorney on file in this Office, copies of the letter are being sent \nto your authorized representatives.\nSincerely,\n____________________________________\nFiliz A.

Taxpayer was previously granted schedules of ruling amounts, most \nrecently on ---------------------.      \nTaxpayer represents the facts and information relating to its requests as follows:\nTaxpayer is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent that elects to be taxed as a \ncorporation for federal income tax purposes.  Parent files a consolidated federal income \ntax return with its affiliated corporations including Taxpayer.  Taxpayer is the sole owner \nof the Plant.\nPLR-155813-09\n2\nThe Plant is situated at Location.  The estimated base cost for decommissioning \nPlant is based on an Independent Study and the proposed method of decommissioning \nthe Plant is Method.\nBased upon the assumptions derived from the Independent Study, it is estimated \nthat Fund assets will earn an average after-tax rate of return ranging from ------ to --------\npercent.  The present value of the future decommissioning costs with respect to \nTaxpayer\u2019s interest in the Plant on ----------------------is estimated to be $----------------------\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------(in -\n------- dollars).  This base cost of decommissioning Plant is escalated at a -----percent \nyearly rate, resulting in a total future cost of decommissioning Taxpayer\u2019s interest in the \nPlant of $--------------------(in ------ through ------- dollars).  Under ratemaking assumptions \nused during the first proceeding before Commission, the Plant would no longer be \nincluded in rate base in ------.\nIn the prior schedule of ruling amounts, issued under \u00a7 468A of the Code as in \neffect prior to 2006, Taxpayer represented that the funding period and level funding \nlimitation period are --- years (------ --------) and the estimated useful life of the Plant is ---\n--- years (---------------). As elected in the initial and subsequent requests for a schedule \nof ruling amounts, Taxpayer calculated the qualifying percentage, pursuant to                  \n\u00a7 1.468A-8(b)(7)(iii) of the regulations as in effect prior to December 31, 2007.  Thus, \nthe percentage of the total estimated costs qualifying for deduction in the schedule of \nruling amounts under prior law was ------- percent.\nSection 468A(a), as amended by the Energy Tax Incentives Act of 2005 (the \nAct), Pub. L. 109-58, 119 Stat. 594, allows an electing taxpayer to deduct payments \nmade to a nuclear decommissioning reserve fund.\nPrior to the changes made by the Act, deductible contributions were limited to the \namount necessary for an electing taxpayer to fund the plant\u2019s post-1983 nuclear \ndecommissioning costs (determined as if decommissioning costs accrued ratably over \nthe estimated useful life of the plant), provided that the taxpayer elected to establish a \nfund in 1984.  Prior law also did not allow an electing taxpayer to establish a fund later \nthan 1984 to contribute to that fund any amount in excess of that amount necessary to \nfund the ratable portion of the plant\u2019s nuclear decommissioning costs beginning in the \nyear the fund is established.  \nSection 468A(f)(1) now allows a taxpayer to contribute to a nuclear \ndecommissioning fund the entire cost of decommissioning the plant, including both the \npre-1984 amount that was denied under the law prior to the Act as well as any amount \nattributable to any year after 1983 in which a taxpayer had not established a fund under \n\u00a7 468A.  Section 468A(f)(2)(A) provides that the deduction for the contribution of the \nPLR-155813-09\n3\npreviously-excluded amount is allowed ratably over the remaining useful life of the \nnuclear plant.\nSection 468A(h) provides that a taxpayer shall be deemed to have made a \npayment to the nuclear decommissioning fund on the last day of a taxable year if the \npayment is made on account of such taxable year and is made within 2\u00bd months after \nthe close of the tax year.  This section applies to payments made pursuant to either a \nschedule of ruling amounts or a schedule of deduction amounts.  \nSection 1.468A-1T(a) provides that an eligible taxpayer may elect to deduct \nnuclear decommissioning costs under \u00a7 468A of the Code.  An \u201celigible taxpayer,\u201d as \ndefined under \u00a7 1.468A-1T(b)(1) of the regulations, is a taxpayer that has a \u201cqualifying \ninterest\u201d in any portion of a nuclear power plant.  A qualifying interest is, among other \nthings, a direct ownership interest.\nSection 1.468A-3T(c)(2) provides rules for determining the estimated useful life \nof a nuclear plant for purposes of \u00a7 468A.  In general, under \u00a7 1.468A-3T(c)(2)(i)(A), if \nthe plant was included in rate base for ratemaking purposes for a period prior to \nJanuary 1, 2006, the date used in the first such ratemaking proceeding as the estimated \ndate on which the nuclear plant will no longer be included in the taxpayer\u2019s rate base is \nthe end of the estimated useful life of the nuclear plant.  Section 1.468A-3T(c)(2)(i)(B) \nprovides that, if the nuclear plant is not described in \u00a7 1.468A-3T(c)(2)(i)(A), the last day \nof the estimated useful life of the nuclear plant is determined as of the date the plant is \nplaced in service.  Under \u00a7 1.468A-3T(c)(2)(i)(C), any reasonable method may be used \nin determining the estimated useful life of a nuclear power plant that is not described in \n\u00a7 1.468A-3T(c)(2)(i)(A).   \nSection 1.468A-3T(d)(1) provides that the amount of decommissioning costs \nallocable to a nuclear decommissioning fund is the taxpayer\u2019s share of the total \nestimated cost of decommissioning the nuclear power plant.  Section 1.468A-3T(d)(3) \nprovides that a taxpayer\u2019s share of the total estimated cost of decommissioning a \nnuclear power plant equals the total estimated cost of decommissioning such plant \nmultiplied by the taxpayer\u2019s qualifying interest in the plant.  \nSection 1.468A-8T(a)(1) provides that, under the provisions of \u00a7 468A(f), as \ndescribed above, a taxpayer may make a special transfer of cash or property to the \nnuclear decommissioning fund.  This special transfer is not subject to the \u00a7 468A(b) \nlimitation.  The amount of the special transfer is the present value of the pre-2005 \nnonqualifying percentage of the estimated future costs of decommissioning the nuclear \nplant that was disallowed under \u00a7 468A prior to the Act.\nSection 1.468A-8T(a)(2) defines the pre-2005 nonqualifying percentage as equal \nto 100 percent reduced by the sum of the qualifying percentage used in determining the \nPLR-155813-09\n4\ntaxpayer\u2019s last schedule of ruling amounts for the fund under \u00a7 468A as it existed prior \nto the Act and the percentage transferred in any previous special transfer.  \nSection 1.468A-8T(a)(3) provides that the taxpayer is not required to transfer the \nentire amount eligible for the special transfer in one year but must take any prior special \ntransfers into account in calculating the pre-2005 qualifying percentage.  Further, \npursuant to \u00a7 1.468A-8T(c)(2), a taxpayer making a special transfer in more than one \nyear must request a new schedule of deduction amounts in connection with each \nspecial transfer.\nSection 1.468A-8T(b) provides that the deduction for the special transfer is \nallowed ratably over the remaining useful life of the nuclear plant.  Under                       \n\u00a7 1.468A-8T(b)(1)(iii), the deduction for property contributed in a special transfer is \nlimited to the lesser of the fair market value of the property or the taxpayer\u2019s basis in the \nproperty.  Under \u00a7 1.468A-8T(b)(4), the taxpayer recognizes no gain or loss on the \nspecial transfer of property, the taxpayer\u2019s basis in the fund is not increased by reason \nof the special transfer of property, and the fund\u2019s basis in the property transferred in the \nspecial transfer is the same as the transferee\u2019s basis in that property immediately prior \nto the special transfer.\nSection 1.468A-8T(c) provides that taxpayer may not make a special transfer to a \nqualified nuclear decommissioning fund unless the taxpayer requests from the IRS a \nschedule of deduction amounts in connection with such transfer.  A request for a \nschedule of deduction amounts may be made in connection with a request for a \nschedule of ruling amounts but in such case, the calculations for both the schedule of \nruling amounts and the schedule of deduction amounts must be separately stated. \nAs stated above, prior to the changes made by the Act, deductible contributions \nwere limited to the lesser of (1) the amount necessary to fund the plant\u2019s post-1983 \nnuclear decommissioning costs, or (2) the amount necessary to fund the plant\u2019s \ndecommissioning costs for that portion of the plant\u2019s estimated useful life for which a \nfund had been established.  Under that prior law, Taxpayer was allowed to contribute ---\n------- percent of the amounts necessary to fully decommission its share of the Plant.  \nSection 468A(f)(1) allows a taxpayer to contribute to the nuclear decommissioning fund \nthe pre-1984 amount that was denied under the law prior to the Act.  \nThus, Taxpayer is able to contribute the additional ------- percent of the amounts \nnecessary to decommission its ownership share of Plant.  The total future cost of \ndecommissioning the Plant $--------------------(in ------ through ------- dollars).  The value \nof that amount on --------------------- is $-----------------(in ------ dollars).\n \nWe have examined the representations and information submitted by the \nTaxpayer in relation to the requirements set forth in \u00a7 468A and the regulations \nthereunder.  Based solely upon these representations of the facts, we conclude that the \nPLR-155813-09\n5\nTaxpayer may make a special transfer of $--------------- in ------, and may ratably deduct \nthe amount contributed for the ------ though ------ tax years, as set forth below.  \nSCHEDULE OF DEDUCTION AMOUNTS\nYEAR\nDEDUCTION AMOUNT\n----------\n----------------------\n----------\n----------------------\n----------\n----------------------\nThe special transfer amount stated above is the maximum amount permitted to \nbe transferred to the fund under \u00a7 468A(f)(1).  If Taxpayer transfers a lesser amount to \nthe fund, the Taxpayer may deduct that lesser amount ratably over the period of years \ndescribed above.  Further, in the event that Taxpayer transfers a lesser amount for the \nyears ------, in order to make an additional special transfer in a later year (including a \nspecial transfer of the difference between the special transfer amount stated above and \nthe lesser amount transferred in ------), Taxpayer must request a new schedule of \ndeduction amounts and in that request must take the ------- transfer into account and \nrecalculate the pre-2005 qualifying percentage in such request. \nWe note that, if Taxpayer elects to make a special transfer of property for all or a \nportion of this special transfer, the amount of the deduction is the lesser of the fair \nmarket value of the property transferred or the basis of the property in the hands of the \nTaxpayer immediately prior to the transfer.  In either event, the deduction of the \nTaxpayer with respect to the property is limited to the Taxpayer\u2019s basis in the property.\nSection 1.468A-3T(f)(1)(iii) requires that a taxpayer requesting a schedule of \ndeduction amounts under \u00a7 1.468A-8T must also request a revised schedule of ruling \namounts for the applicable fund.  However, \u00a7 1.468A-3T(f)(1)(v) provides that if a \ntaxpayer is required to request a revised schedule of ruling amounts and each ruling \namount in the revised schedule would equal zero, a taxpayer may, instead of requesting \na revised schedule of ruling amounts, begin treating the ruling amount as equal to zero \ndollars.  Taxpayer has no schedule of ruling amounts in effect for the current or future \nyears and therefore its annual ruling amount is zero.  Pursuant to \u00a7 1.468A-3T(f)(1)(v), \nTaxpayer will continue to treat its annual ruling amount as equal to zero dollars and, \naccordingly, has not made a request for a revised schedule of ruling amounts.\nExcept as specifically determined above, no opinion is expressed or implied \nconcerning the Federal income tax consequences of the transaction described above.  \nSpecifically, no determination is made whether the independent decommissioning study \nconforms to industry standards and practices.\nPLR-155813-09\n6\nThis ruling is directed only to the Taxpayer who requested it.  Section 6110(k)(3) \nof the Code provides it may not be used or cited as precedent.  In accordance with the \npower of attorney on file with this office, a copy of this letter is being sent to your \nauthorized representatives.  We are also sending a copy of this letter ruling to the \nDirector.  Pursuant to \u00a7 1.468A-7T(a), a copy of this letter must be attached (with the \nrequired Election Statement) to the Taxpayer's federal income tax return for each tax \nyear in which the Taxpayer claims a deduction for payments made to the Fund.\nSincerely,\nPeter C.

Proc. 2000-1, 2000-1 I.R.B. 4, requesting rulings under \u00a7\n1031 of the Internal Revenue Code (Code).\nFacts:\nTaxpayer\u2019s business consists of real estate investment and leasing operations. \nTaxpayer owns and operates Commercial facilities located in State 1, State 2, and\nState 3.  Taxpayer also owns a number of office buildings and recreational facilities,\nand a parking garage and two parking lots in City. \nAccommodation Party is engaged in the business of acquiring, owning, holding,\nleasing, financing, refinancing, and disposing of real property and its associated\npersonal property.  Accommodation Party is a single-member State 2 limited liability\ncompany that has not elected pursuant to \u00a7 301.7701 of the Income Tax Regulations to\nbe classified as an association.  As a result, Accommodation Party is treated as a\n3\nPLR-120486-00\ndivision or branch of its sole member, Exchange Company, a State 1 corporation. \nNeither Accommodation Party nor Exchange Company bears a relationship to Taxpayer\nthat would result in either of them being treated as a \u201cdisqualified person\u201d as defined in \n\u00a7 1.1031(k)-1(k) of the regulations.\nThe Relinquished Property\nTaxpayer, through its predecessor entity, acquired the Relinquished Property\n(the Park) in Decade 1.  Since this acquisition, Taxpayer has held the Park as\ninvestment and rental property.  During the past several years, Conservation\nOrganization has indicated its ongoing interest in acquiring the Park for public parkland. \nConservation Organization is an exempt organization under \u00a7 501(c)(3) of the Code,\nwhich has among its purposes the acquisition of open space, scenic and recreational\nlands on behalf of the public. \nBeginning in early Year 1, Conservation Organization and Taxpayer began\nserious discussions about entering into an agreement whereby Conservation\nOrganization would have the option to acquire the Park under certain terms and\nconditions.  Accordingly, after significant negotiations, Taxpayer and Conservation\nOrganization entered into a Bargain Sale Option Agreement dated Date 1 (Option\nAgreement).\nUpon execution of the Option Agreement, Conservation Organization paid\nAmount 1 to Taxpayer for an exclusive and irrevocable option to acquire all or some\nlesser portion of the Park for public, open space and recreational purposes (the\nOption).  The all-cash purchase price under the Option Agreement is Amount 2 for the\nentire Park and if Conservation Organization elects to purchase a lesser portion, the\npurchase price is generally equal to 96% of the appraised value of such parcel.  The\nOption was contingent upon, among other things, the passage by State 1 voters of the\nBond Act.  The initial term of the  Option was through the earlier of Date 6 or the date\nthe Bond Act failed to pass.\nOn Date 5, State 1 voters approved the Bond Act.  As a result, the  Option\nsurvived through Date 6.  On Date 6, pursuant to a First Amendment to the Option\nAgreement, the initial option term was extended through Date 8 in consideration for\nConservation Organization\u2019s cash payment to Taxpayer of Amount 3.  Pursuant to this\namendment, Conservation Organization\u2019s extended option term began on Date 9 and\nwill expire on Date 14 in exchange for Conservation Organization\u2019s total cash payments\nof Amount 4 (Amount 5 was paid on Date 8 and Amount 6 will be due on Date 13,\npayable to an escrow holder for Taxpayer\u2019s benefit, unless Conservation Organization\ncompletes its purchase of all or some portion of the Park for an amount not less than\nAmount 7 on or before Date 12).  These option payments are generally nonrefundable\nand will be credited against the purchase price for the Park when Conservation\nOrganization exercises the Option.\n4\nPLR-120486-00\nThe Option Agreement contains a tax-deferred exchange cooperation provision\nstating that Taxpayer has the right to effectuate a tax-deferred exchange, within the\nmeaning of \u00a7 1031, of all or any portion of the Park and that Conservation Organization\nwill cooperate with Taxpayer to effectuate any such exchange.  The provision also\nprovides that if Taxpayer effectuates an exchange under \u00a7 1031, title to the Park will be\ntransferred to Conservation Organization by an accommodation party, and\nConservation Organization agrees to accept title to the Park from such accommodation\nparty as if title had been transferred to Conservation Organization directly from\nTaxpayer.  Conservation Organization has also agreed to execute any and all\ndocuments which are reasonably necessary to carry out the tax-deferred exchange,\nand Taxpayer agrees to remain liable for its obligations under the Option Agreement\nafter entering into any \u00a7 1031 exchange.  The Option Agreement further provides that\nall risk of loss with respect to the Park will remain with Taxpayer until the closing of \nConservation Organization\u2019s purchase of all or a portion of the Park.\nConservation Organization\u2019s eventual exercise of the Option and acquisition of\nthe Park has been, and will continue to be subject to and contingent upon a number of\npublic hearings and procedural steps, including, but not limited to:  (1) the passage of\nthe Bond Act, (2) gubernatorial budget proposal and State 1 legislative approval, (3)\npreparation of an appraisal prepared to governmental guidelines and approved by the\nacquiring agencies, (4) approval by public agencies of the value established by the\nappraisal; and (5) public hearings and preparation of numerous documents for public\nreview and consideration.\nThe Replacement Property\nOn Date 11, Accommodation Party acquired the Replacement Property (the\nProperty) pursuant to a Property Acquisition Agreement dated Date 3 by and between\nAccommodation Party and Seller and a Date 7 Amendment (Property Acquisition\nAgreement) for a total cash purchase price of Amount 8.  Accommodation Party funded\nits purchase of the Property and the related transaction costs by borrowing Amount 9\nfrom Bank and additional monies from Taxpayer pursuant to a full recourse line of\ncredit, which provides for a loan to Accommodation Party of up to Amount 10 under\ncertain terms and conditions.\nThe Bank loan (Bank Loan) dated Date 10 with Accommodation Party, as\nborrower, is secured by the Property and is also guaranteed by Taxpayer.  Taxpayer\u2019s\nguaranty of the Bank Loan is evidenced by a payment guaranty and Taxpayer\u2019s\nenvironmental indemnification of Bank is evidenced by an indemnity agreement, each\ndated Date 10, and made by Taxpayer in favor of Bank.  Accommodation Party has\nagreed to pay Taxpayer Amount 11 as a loan guaranty fee for Taxpayer\u2019s agreement to\nexecute and deliver the Bank Loan payment guaranty.  The Bank Loan bears interest at\nRate 1 and is due on Date 15, subject to an optional three-month extension through\nDate 16.  The Taxpayer loan made pursuant to a Loan Agreement between Taxpayer\n5\nPLR-120486-00\nand Accommodation Party dated Date 4 (Taxpayer Loan) is unsecured and bears\ninterest at Rate 2 calculated and compounded annually.  The Taxpayer Loan is due on\nthe earlier of the sale of the Property or Date 17.  Accordingly, all of Accommodation\nParty\u2019s acquisition obligations bear interest at market rates.\nAccommodation Party has leased the Property to Taxpayer pursuant to a Lease \nbetween Accommodation Party, as landlord, and Taxpayer, as tenant, dated Date 11. \nIn addition to entering into the Lease with Taxpayer, Accommodation Party assigned its\ninterest in certain leases and contracts that Accommodation Party acquired through its\nacquisition of the Property to Taxpayer and Taxpayer assumed the related liabilities\nfrom Accommodation Party. \nUnder the Lease, Taxpayer pays Accommodation Party a monthly base rent plus\nadditional rent equal to all taxes, insurance and maintenance costs with respect to the\nProperty.  This rental provision is standard in the case of \u201ctriple net\u201d leases.  The Lease\nhas an initial one-year term with a one-year optional extension of the initial term.  The\namount of the rent exceeds Accommodation Party\u2019s cost of operating the Property\n(including debt service).\nAccommodation Party and Taxpayer have also entered into a Real Estate\nAcquisition Agreement dated Date 2, which was amended and restated on Date 11\n(Taxpayer Acquisition Agreement).  Pursuant to the Taxpayer Acquisition Agreement\nand subject to Taxpayer entering into the Lease, Accommodation Party entered into the\nProperty Acquisition Agreement, the Bank Loan and the Taxpayer Loan\n(Accommodation Party Loans) to acquire the Property.\nAs long as Accommodation Party owns the Property, Accommodation Party and\nTaxpayer will report their related transactions for federal income tax purposes in\naccordance with its form, that is, Accommodation Party as the owner and lessor of the\nProperty and Taxpayer as the lessee under the Lease and lessor under the subleases\nto customers of the Property.\nUnder the Taxpayer Acquisition Agreement, Taxpayer has an option to purchase\n(or acquire through a tax-deferred exchange) all or a portion of the Property for an\namount equal to the fair market value of the designated portion of the Property.  For this\npurpose, the fair market value of the Property (or any portion thereof) for any purchase\nby Taxpayer within eighteen months of the Property\u2019s acquisition by Accommodation\nParty is generally equal to Accommodation Party\u2019s cost of acquiring the Property. \nIn the event that the option is terminated, upon the occurrence of a certain\nspecified event(s), Accommodation Party may sell the Property in conformity with the\ntermination sale procedures set forth in the Taxpayer Acquisition Agreement.  If\nAccommodation Party does not satisfy the termination sale procedures, upon its receipt\nof a termination notice, it will have the potential for exposure to economic loss. \n6\nPLR-120486-00\nHowever, Accommodation Party is not obligated to sell the Property and may retain the\nProperty free and clear of all obligations under the Taxpayer Acquisition Agreement. \nThus, Accommodation Party has the potential to realize economic gain from its\nownership of the Property.  \nIf Accommodation Party elects to sell the Property, Taxpayer must reimburse\nAccommodation Party for x portion of net sale proceeds as compared to all acquisition\nand debt costs and fees and any other unreimbursed selling and closing costs and\ntransfer taxes incurred by Accommodation Party.  If the net sale proceeds exceed these\ncosts, Accommodation Party may retain any such excess.  In the event no offers or bids\nare received for the Property, or if for any reason the Property cannot be sold despite\nthe good faith efforts of Accommodation Party to do so, the net sale proceeds are\ndeemed to equal y portion and any charges and costs incurred by Accommodation\nParty in trying to sell the Property will increase the shortfall, which must be reimbursed\nin z portion by Taxpayer. \nThe Taxpayer Acquisition Agreement includes a general environmental release\nand indemnification of Accommodation Party and its affiliates by Taxpayer.  The\nTaxpayer Acquisition Agreement also includes a \u201cTax Deferred Exchange\u201d provision\nstating Taxpayer\u2019s right to effectuate a \u00a7 1031 exchange for all or any portion of the\nProperty.  Under the provision, Accommodation Party agrees to cooperate with\nTaxpayer to effectuate any and all such exchanges and Taxpayer agrees to indemnify,\ndefend and hold Accommodation Party harmless from any losses incurred by\nAccommodation Party as a result of any such exchange.  The provision also provides\nthat Accommodation Party understands and consents to any assignment by Taxpayer\nof its rights and responsibilities under the Taxpayer Acquisition Agreement to a qualified\nintermediary selected by Taxpayer and that Accommodation Party agrees to execute all\ndocuments reasonably required to carry out any such \u00a7 1031 exchange.\nThe Deferred Exchange of the Park for the Property\nSince the inception of this transaction, Taxpayer has intended to exchange the\nPark for all or a portion of the Property in a tax-deferred exchange under \u00a7 1031.  As\nsoon as Conservation Organization is in a position to acquire the Park under the\nOption, Taxpayer will assign all of its rights in the Option Agreement and transfer the\nPark to a qualified intermediary within the meaning of \u00a7 1.1031(k)-1(g)(4) of the\nregulations (the QI).  The QI will then sell the Park to Conservation Organization\npursuant to the Option Agreement and take receipt of all sale proceeds with respect to\nsuch sale.\nWithin 45 days after the transfer by Taxpayer of the Park to the QI, Taxpayer will\nidentify all or a portion of the Property as like-kind replacement property in accordance\nwith \u00a7 1031(a)(3)(A).  The QI will acquire the identified Property from Accommodation\nParty pursuant to an assignment of all of Taxpayer\u2019s rights under Taxpayer\u2019s option in\n7\nPLR-120486-00\nthe Taxpayer Acquisition Agreement and transfer the acquired Property to Taxpayer\nbefore the earlier of (i) 180 days after Taxpayer\u2019s transfer, or (ii) the due date (including\nextensions) of Taxpayer\u2019s return for the year in which Taxpayer\u2019s transfer occurred. \nTaxpayer intends to hold the Property for use as rental real property.\nRulings Requested:\n(1)  Taxpayer\u2019s exchange of the Park for the Property will qualify for\nnonrecognition treatment under \u00a7 1031.\n(2) The portion of the Property to be acquired in exchange for the Park will\nqualify as \u201creplacement property\u201d as defined in \u00a71.1031(k)-1(a) of the regulations.\nLaw And Analysis:\nSection 1031(a)(1) provides that no gain or loss will be recognized on the\nexchange of property held for productive use in a trade or business or for investment if\nthe property is exchanged solely for property of a like kind which is to be held either for\nproductive use in a trade or business or for investment. \nUnder \u00a7 1.1031(a)-1(b) of the regulations relating to the meaning of the term\n\u201clike-kind,\u201d real property is generally considered to be like kind to all other real property,\nwhether or not any of the real property is improved. \nSection 1031(a)(3) provides certain requirements for treating property received in\na nonsimultaneous exchange as like-kind property to the relinquished property.  Under \n\u00a7 1031(a)(3), any property received by the taxpayer (the \u201creplacement property\u201d) will not\nbe like kind to the relinquished property transferred if the replacement property (a) is not\nidentified within 45 days of the taxpayer\u2019s transfer of the relinquished property, or (b) is\nreceived after the earlier of (i) 180 days after the taxpayer\u2019s transfer, or (ii) the due date\n(including extensions) for the taxpayer\u2019s return for the year in which the taxpayer\u2019s\ntransfer occurred. \nSection 1.1031(k)-1 of the regulations provides guidance on \u201cdeferred\nexchanges.\u201d  These regulations specify in detail the circumstances in which deferred\nexchanges will be accorded nonrecognition treatment.  Specifically omitted from such\nguidance is any application of these regulations to \u201creverse exchanges.\u201d  T.D. 8346,\n1991-1 C.B. 150, 151 (April 25, 1991).\nOn September 15, 2000, the Service issued Rev. Proc. 2000-37, 2000-40 I.R.B.\n308, setting forth a safe harbor for reverse like-kind exchanges under \u00a7 1031.  Under\nthe Rev. Proc. 2000-37 safe harbor provisions, the Service will not challenge either (a)\nthe qualification of the property as either replacement or relinquished property (as\ndefined in \u00a7 1.1031(k)-1(a) of the regulations) or (b) the treatment of the exchange\n8\nPLR-120486-00\naccommodation titleholder as the beneficial owner if the property is held in a \u201cqualified\nexchange accommodation arrangement\u201d (a QEAA).\nRev. Proc. 2000-37 is effective for QEAAs entered into on or after September\n15, 2000.  Rev. Proc. 2000-37 provides that \u201cno inference\u201d is intended with respect to\nthe federal income tax treatment of similar arrangements entered into prior to or after its\neffective date.  Further, the Service stated that it recognizes that \u201cparking\u201d transactions\ncan be accomplished outside of the safe harbor provided in the revenue procedure.  \u00a7\n3.02 of Rev. Proc. 2000-37.\nRev. Proc. 2000-37 does not apply to Taxpayer\u2019s transaction.  First,\nAccommodation Party\u2019s acquisition of the Property predates the effective date of Rev.\nProc. 2000-37.  Second, even if Rev. Proc. 2000-37 applied to the transaction,\nAccommodation Party acquired the Property on Date 11, which will be more than 180\ndays before the transfer of the Property to Taxpayer. \nCourts have permitted taxpayers significant latitude in structuring tax-deferred\nlike-kind exchanges.  See Starker v. United States, 602 F.2d 1341 (9th Cir. 1979)\n(transfers need not occur simultaneously); Coastal Terminals, Inc. v. United States, 320\nF.2d 333 (4th Cir. 1963) (tax consequences depend on what the parties intended and\naccomplished rather than the separate steps); Alderson v. Commissioner, 317 F.2d 790\n(9th Cir. 1963) (parties can amend a previously executed sales agreement to provide for\nan exchange), rev\u2019g 38 T.C. 215 (1962); Barker v. Commissioner, 74 T.C. 555 (1980) (a\nparty can hold transitory ownership of exchange property solely for the purposes of\neffecting the exchange).  A taxpayer can locate suitable replacement property to be\nreceived in an exchange and can enter into negotiations for the acquisition of such\nproperty.  See Coastal Terminals; Alderson; Coupe v. Commissioner, 52 T.C. 394\n(1969), acq. in result only,1970-2 C.B. xix.  A taxpayer can also oversee improvements\non the replacement property to be acquired, and can even advance funds toward the\npurchase of the replacement property to be acquired by exchange.  See J.H. Baird\nPublishing Co. v. Commissioner, 39 T.C. 608 (1962), acq., 1963-2 C.B. 4,  Biggs v.\nCommissioner, 632 F.2d 1171 (5th Cir. 1980), aff\u2019g 69 T.C. 905  (1978).\nCase law authority also exists for treating a reverse exchange as a qualifying\nlike-kind exchange under \u00a7 1031.  In Rutherford v. Commissioner, T.C. Memo 1978-\n505, taxpayer, a farmer engaged in the cattle breeding business, entered into an\nagreement with another farmer whereby farmer would transfer 12 half-blood heifers to\ntaxpayer who, at his own expense, would have the heifers artificially inseminated with\nthe sperm of a registered bull.  Once the first 12 three-quarter blood heifers were born,\ntaxpayer would deliver the heifers to farmer.  The agreement provided for no monetary\npayments.  \nPursuant to their agreement, farmer delivered the half-blood heifers to taxpayer\nin November 1973.  Taxpayer satisfied his obligation by delivering the three-quarter-\n9\nPLR-120486-00\nblood heifers to farmer over a several year period beginning with four heifers in 1975,\nthree in 1976 and five in 1977.  The Tax Court determined that taxpayer had\nsuccessfully completed a tax-deferred exchange under \u00a7 1031 by his transfer of the\nrelinquished property (the three-quarter blood heifers) for the replacement property (the\nhalf-blood heifers).  Thus in the qualifying \u201creverse exchange,\u201d taxpayer received the\nreplacement property before the relinquished property was even conceived.  \nSimilarly, in Biggs, the Tax Court and the Fifth Circuit found that taxpayer\u2019s\n\u201creverse exchange\u201d of two parcels of land located in Maryland for four parcels of land\nlocated in Virginia qualified under \u00a7 1031.  Taxpayer advanced monies to Shore Title\nCompany, which was owned and controlled by taxpayer\u2019s attorney, to buy the Virginia\nproperties (the replacement property) from a fourth party before the Maryland\nproperties (the relinquished property) were sold.  In addition to advancing acquisition\nfunds to Shore, taxpayer directly paid the finder\u2019s fee and all of the closing costs to\nacquire the replacement property.  Several months later, taxpayer transferred his\nrelinquished property to the second party and received back his advanced funds. \nShore then transferred the replacement property to taxpayer.\nThe Service contended that the exchange did not qualify under \u00a7 1031, because\nShore served as an agent for taxpayer throughout the transactions.  The Service\nargued that because Shore acted as taxpayer\u2019s agent, taxpayer \u201cmerely effected an\nexchange with himself.\u201d  Both courts rejected the Service\u2019s characterization of Shore as\ntaxpayer\u2019s agent and concluded that the fact that Shore was used to facilitate the\nexchange did not mean that Shore was taxpayer\u2019s agent.  In their respective decisions,\nthe Tax Court and the Fifth Circuit each held that the exchange qualified under \u00a7 1031\nbecause (a) taxpayer always intended to enter into a tax-deferred exchange; (b) the\nvarious transfers were all interdependent and integrated parts of a single overall plan,\nand (c) Shore was not acting as taxpayer\u2019s agent.\nMoreover, in J.H. Baird Publishing Co. and Coastal Terminals, the Tax Court and\nthe Fourth Circuit, respectively, approved qualifying \u00a7 1031 exchanges where the\nreplacement property was acquired by a third party at the taxpayer\u2019s direction for the\npre-exchange completion of significant improvements.  After completion of the\ntaxpayer-directed construction, the newly constructed property was acquired by the\ntaxpayer as replacement property and in each case qualified under \u00a7 1031.\nIn J.H. Baird, the Board of Directors of a Sunday school desired to acquire a\nbuilding owned by J.H. Baird Publishing Co.  Baird, however, only wanted to exchange\nits property in a tax-deferred exchange.  To accomplish Baird\u2019s and the Board\u2019s goals,\nthe parties entered into certain agreements with Realty Co.  As a result and at Baird\u2019s\ndirection, on October 15, 1956, Realty acquired an appropriate vacant lot.  On October\n31, 1956, Realty Co. sold Baird\u2019s relinquished property to the Board.  The sale\nproceeds from the relinquished property went into a Realty Co. escrow account for\nBaird and the monies were used by Realty Co. to construct the replacement property. \n10\nPLR-120486-00\nMeanwhile, Baird continued to occupy the relinquished property rent-free until the\nreplacement property was completed.  After completion of the new building in 1957,\nBaird received title to the replacement property and some excess cash from Realty Co.\nin exchange for the previously transferred relinquished property.\nThe Service denied like-kind exchange treatment on the grounds that there could\nnot have been an exchange because Realty Co. was acting as Baird\u2019s agent.  The\nService contended that Realty Co., acting as Baird\u2019s agent, had sold Baird\u2019s\nrelinquished property and with the sale proceeds had acquired and built a new property\nfor Baird at his direction.  Accordingly, the Service concluded that no exchange\noccurred.\nIn its decision, the Tax Court reviewed the concept of agency and found that an\nagency relationship is based upon a contract, either express or implied, between parties\nand that the contract here did not purport to create an agency.  The court also\nacknowledged that the facts and circumstances indicated that an agency relationship\ndid not exist.  Thus, even though Realty Co. (i) held the relinquished property sale\nproceeds in an escrow account for Baird; (ii) agreed to build the replacement property\non a vacant lot according to specifications approved by Baird; and (iii) agreed to\ntransfer the completed replacement property plus any excess cash from the sale of\nBaird\u2019s property to Baird in exchange for Baird\u2019s property, the Tax Court found that\nRealty Co. was not acting as Baird\u2019s agent, but rather Realty Co. was acting on its own\nbehalf as a principal. \nAn agency analysis, therefore, underlies the determination of whether or not an\nexchange occurred.  The concept of agency is also inherent in the \u00a7 1.1031(k)-1\nregulations, which provide for the use of a qualified intermediary as a safe harbor.  The\nregulations respect the qualified intermediary as a bona fide party to the exchange and\nnot as the agent of the taxpayer.  See \u00a71.1031(k)-1(g)(4)(i).\nWhile taxpayer attempts to convert independent purchase and sale transactions\ninto reverse exchanges have failed, these cases are distinguishable from the foregoing\ntaxpayer favorable cases.  See, e.g., Bezdjian v. Commissioner, 845 F.2d 217 (9th Cir.\n1988), aff\u2019g T.C. Memo 1987-140; Lee v. Commissioner, T.C. Memo 1986-294; Dibsy v.\nCommissioner, T.C. Memo 1995-477; Lincoln v. Commissioner, T.C. Memo 1998-421. \nIn each of these failed reverse exchange cases, the taxpayers merely purchased one\nproperty and subsequently sold another property to a different party.  The complete lack\nof contractual interdependence between each property purchase and sale forecloses\nany argument for exchange treatment, regardless of whether the purported exchange\nwould be a reverse, simultaneous or deferred exchange.  In these situations, the\ntaxpayers\u2019 steps were not an interrelated exchange transaction.\nThe recent Tax Court decision in DeCleene v. Commissioner, 115 T.C. No. 34\n(2000), is also distinguishable from the present case.  Although the court analyzed the\n11\nPLR-120486-00\n1  See Moline Properties, Inc. v. Commissioner, 319 U.S. 436, 440-441 (1943).  In this case, the\nSupreme Court did not find an agency relationship between a sole shareholder and his wholly owned\ncorporation, because among other reasons \u201c[t]here was no actual contract of agency, nor the usual\nincidents of an agency relationship.\u201d \ncase as if it involved a \u201creverse exchange,\u201d it held that the underlying transaction did not\ninvolve a like-kind exchange.\nIn the DeCleene case, taxpayer acquired the Lawrence property in 1992. \nApproximately one year later, taxpayer transferred the Lawrence property to Western\nLime and Cement Co. (WLC) in exchange for a nonrecourse note and, three months\nlater, received back the Lawrence property in exchange for the McDonald property and\npayment on the note.  The court held that WLC did not acquire any of the benefits and\nburdens of ownership of the Lawrence property and, therefore, the Lawrence property\nwas never transferred to WLC.  If the Lawrence property was never transferred to WLC,\nthen the only way in which the transaction could qualify for nonrecognition under \u00a7 1031\nwould be if the acquisition of the Lawrence property in 1992 was treated as part of an\nintegrated plan to exchange it for the McDonald property.  However, because at the\ntime of the acquisition of the Lawrence property, taxpayer had not taken any steps to\nevidence an intent to enter into an exchange, such an integrated plan did not exist.  As\na result, the court did not reach the issue of the circumstances under which a parking\ntransaction that is entered into as part of an integrated plan to accomplish a like-kind\nexchange qualifies for nonrecognition under \u00a7 1031.\n \nIn Commissioner v. Bollinger, 485 U.S. 340 (1988), the Supreme Court\nreaffirmed its agency analysis set forth in National Carbide Corp. v. Commissioner, 336\nU.S. 422 (1949).  The Supreme Court\u2019s agency analysis has four factors and two\nrequirements, \u201cthe sum of which has become known . . . as the \u2018six National Carbide\nfactors.\u2019\u201d  Bollinger, 485 U.S. at 346.  The Supreme Court\u2019s National Carbide factors\nare as follows: \n(1) Whether the party in question operates in the name and for the\naccount of the principal; \n(2) binds the principal by its actions;\n(3) transmits money received to the principal; and\n(4) whether receipt of income is attributable to the services of employees\nof the principal and to assets belonging to the principal.\n(5) The agency-principal relationship cannot be founded solely on the fact\nthat the principal owns the agent.  For example, a corporation will in\nmost cases be treated as a taxable entity separate from its sole\nstockholder.1\n(6) The business purpose of the party in question must be the carrying on\nof the normal duties of an agent.\n12\nPLR-120486-00\nNational Carbide Corp., 336 U.S. at 437.\nThe foregoing authorities present three general requirements for an exchange to\nbe recognized as a like-kind exchange under  \u00a7 1031 in similar situations:\n(1)  the taxpayer must demonstrate its intent to achieve an exchange and the       \nproperties to be exchanged must be of like kind and for a qualified use;\n(2)  the steps in the various transfers must be part of an integrated plan to       \nexchange the relinquished property for the replacement property; and\n(3)  the party holding the replacement property must not be the taxpayer\u2019s agent.\nIntent to Exchange\nFirst, a taxpayer must intend to enter into an exchange of property for like-kind\nproperty each used by the taxpayer in a trade or business or held as an investment. \nSee Coastal Terminals (\u201c[w]hether the transaction constituted a sale or exchange for\nincome tax purposes depends on the intent of the parties and this intent is to be\ndetermined from all relevant facts and circumstances,\u201d quoting Sarkes Tazian, Inc. v.\nUnited States, 240 F.2d 467, 470 (7th Cir. 1957)); Biggs (taxpayer insisted at all times\nthat he receive like-kind property as part of the consideration for the transfer of the\nMaryland property); Baird (parties intended, and the contract provided for, an\nexchange); Rutland v. Commissioner, T.C. Memo 1977-8 (transaction qualified for \u00a7\n1031 treatment because the parties intended to effect an exchange and an exchange\noccurred); Fredericks v. Commissioner, T.C. Memo 1994-27 (taxpayer\u2019s intent to\nexchange property was evidenced by the documentation of the parties\u2019 agreement).   \nIn this case, Taxpayer has evidenced its clear and consistent intent to exchange\nthe Park for the Property in a transaction qualifying under  \u00a7 1031.  Taxpayer has\nconsistently insisted from the beginning of its transaction that the exchange of the Park\nfor the Property must be structured as a tax-deferred exchange of like-kind property. \nTaxpayer has evidenced this intent by its inclusion of \u201ctax-deferred exchange\ncooperation provisions\u201d in each of the Conservation Organization Option Agreement,\nthe Property Acquisition Agreement, and the Taxpayer Acquisition Agreement.  As soon\nas Conservation Organization exercises its option to purchase the Park (which will be\naccomplished by using a qualified intermediary), Taxpayer will take the steps outlined\nabove to effect a tax-deferred exchange of the Park for the Property in accordance with \n\u00a7 1031(a)(3) and \u00a7 1.1031(k)-1 of the regulations.   Moreover, the Park and the\nProperty are like-kind property under \u00a7 1.1031(a)-1(b) and Taxpayer has held the Park\nas rental and investment property and will hold the Property as rental property after the\ncompletion of the exchange.\n13\nPLR-120486-00\nInterdependent and Integrated Overall Plan\nSecond, the steps in the various transfers must be interdependent and\nintegrated parts of a single overall plan to achieve an exchange.  See, e.g., Biggs, 632\nF.2d at 1177-1178 (the many transactions leading to the ultimate transfers of the\nMaryland and Virginia properties were part of a single, integrated plan, the substantive\nresult of which was a like-kind exchange); Coastal Terminals, 320 F.2d at 337 (\u201cthe\ntransaction must be viewed as a whole ...\u201d, quoting Commissioner v. Court Holding Co.,\n324 U.S. 331, 334 (1945)); Fredericks v. Commissioner, T.C. Memo 1994-27 (taxpayer\nstructured an integrated four party exchange).  Taxpayer has entered into the series of\nsteps described above as part of its overall plan to exchange the Park for the Property. \nTaxpayer has specifically designed and entered into each of the Conservation\nOrganization Option Agreement and the Taxpayer Acquisition Agreement with\nAccommodation Party to achieve its overall plan of exchanging the Park for the\nProperty.  The overall substance of Taxpayer\u2019s series of transactions, which have been\nspecifically designed and executed as parts of an overall unitary plan, is Taxpayer\u2019s\nexchange of the Park for the Property.\nAccommodation Party Not Taxpayer\u2019s Agent\nMoreover, under the Supreme Court\u2019s agency analysis, Taxpayer\u2019s relationship\nwith Accommodation Party is not an agency relationship.  In accordance with the\nSupreme Court\u2019s agency analysis,  we apply the National Carbide factors to the facts of\nTaxpayer\u2019s transaction and its relationship with Accommodation Party.  With respect to\nthe first factor, Accommodation Party has operated and will operate in its own name\nand for its own account.  The Operating Agreement of Accommodation Party states\n\u201c[a]ll business of Accommodation Party will be conducted in the Accommodation Party\nname\u201d and that \u201cAccommodation Party will own and hold title to all of its property in the\nname of Accommodation Party.\u201d  Consistent with its operating agreement,\nAccommodation Party entered into the Property Acquisition Agreement, the Taxpayer\nAcquisition Agreement, the Lease, the Bank Loan, and the Taxpayer Loan each in its\nown name and each for its own account.  Accommodation Party operates its business\nthrough its own bank accounts, which are held in its name and for its account.  In none\nof the operative documents is Accommodation Party referred to as Taxpayer\u2019s agent.\nWith respect to the second factor, Taxpayer has not contractually authorized\nAccommodation Party to bind Taxpayer by Accommodation Party\u2019s actions.  \nWith respect to the third factor, Accommodation Party does not transmit money it\nreceives for its account to Taxpayer.  Under the Lease, Taxpayer is obligated to pay\nAccommodation Party a monthly base rent for Accommodation Party\u2019s account.\nApplying the fourth factor, Accommodation Party\u2019s rental income under the\nLease is pursuant to its lessor-lessee relationship with Taxpayer and Accommodation\n14\nPLR-120486-00\nParty\u2019s ownership of the Property.  Taxpayer\u2019s rental income from the subtenants under\nthe subleases is pursuant to Accommodation Party\u2019s assignment of such subleases to\nTaxpayer under the assignments of lessor\u2019s interests in leases and assumption of\nliability under the leases.\nThe fifth factor is that \u201cthe agency relationship must not be dependent upon the\nfact that the principal owns it.\u201d  Accommodation Party and Taxpayer are separate legal\nentities.  Neither Accommodation Party nor Exchange Company is owned by or related\nto Taxpayer.  Furthermore, as demonstrated by the preceding analysis,\nAccommodation Party is not acting on behalf of Taxpayer, but rather is acting for its\nown account.  Exchange Company, as the sole member of Accommodation Party, will\nreport Accommodation Party\u2019s rental income and expenses on its tax returns.\nWith respect to the sixth factor, Accommodation Party\u2019s business purpose is not\nto carry on the normal duties of an agent.  As stated in its operating agreement and as\ndemonstrated by its actions, (1) Accommodation Party is engaged in the business of\nacquiring, owning, holding, leasing, financing, refinancing and disposing of real property\nand its associated personal property and (2) Accommodation Party will conduct its\nbusiness and will hold title to all of its property in its own name and for its own account.  \nFurther, the Tax Court has consistently held that the fact that an accommodator\nis used to facilitate a like-kind exchange does not mean that the accommodator is an\nagent of the taxpayer.   For example, in Baird, the sale proceeds were held in an\naccount \u201cunder the name of Realty, Escrow Agent for Baird\u201d and Baird had to approve\nall construction and related invoices.  Similarly, in Fredericks, the accommodator\nacquired title to the relinquished property and the replacement property and obtained\nfinancing and constructed improvements for the purpose of facilitating the taxpayer\u2019s\nlike-kind exchange.  Thus, the fact that Accommodation Party is facilitating Taxpayer\u2019s\nexchange of the Park for the Property does not mean Accommodation Party is\nTaxpayer\u2019s agent.\nAccordingly, Accommodation Party is not Taxpayer\u2019s agent.\nBased on the foregoing analysis and Taxpayer\u2019s representations, we rule as\nfollows:\n(1)  Taxpayer\u2019s exchange of the Park for the Property will qualify for                        \n                nonrecognition treatment under \u00a7 1031.\n(2)  The Property will qualify as \u201creplacement property\u201d as defined in  \n       \u00a7 1.1031(k)-1(a) for purposes of \u00a7 1031 and the regulations thereunder.\n15\nPLR-120486-00\nThis ruling is directed only to the taxpayer(s) requesting it.  Section 6110(k)(3) of\nthe Code provides that it may not be used or cited as precedent.\nSincerely yours,\nASSOCIATE CHIEF COUNSEL\n(Income Tax & Accounting)\nBy:  Kelly E.

The Administrative Committee is comprised of members \nof the bargaining committee.  The election becomes effective no earlier than the \ncalendar month following the month in which the election is made. \n \nThe Plan provides for a maximum amount that may be deferred by a participant \nin any taxable year.  It also provides for a catch-up contribution for amounts deferred for \none or more of the participant's last three taxable years ending before he or she attains \nnormal retirement age under the Plan.  The normal retirement age for purposes of the \ncatch-up provisions is any age on or after the earlier of age 62 or the earliest date at \nwhich the participant would be eligible to retire and receive a full pension benefit and \nmay not be later than age seventy and a half.  A Participant\u2019s normal retirement age \nmust be the same as his or her normal retirement age under any other eligible deferred \ncompensation plan established and maintained by County.  A qualified firefighter or \npolice officer as defined in section 415(b)(2)(H)(ii)(I) may designate a normal retirement \nage that is between the ages of forty and seventy and a half.  In addition, the Plan \nprovides for age fifty-plus catch-up contributions described in section 457(e)(18).  The \namounts that may be deferred under the annual maximum limitation and the catch-up \nprovisions are within the limitations of section 457(c). \n \nEach Participant shall direct the investment of amounts held in his or her account \nbalance under the Plan among the Plan\u2019s investment options.  Subject to the form and \nmanner prescribed by the Plan, participants are permitted to amend their investment \nelections at such times and in such manner and form as prescribed by the \nAdministrative Committee.  \n \nWith certain limitations, a Participant may elect the manner in which his or her \ndeferred amounts will be distributed.  Benefits generally may be paid in the form of: (1) \na lump-sum; (2) annual installments; (3) life annuity; (4) life annuity with period certain; \nor (5) joint and survivor annuity.  The Plan provides that the manner and time of benefit \npayout must meet the distribution requirements of sections 457(d) and 401(a)(9) of the \nCode. \n \nThe Plan also provides for a distribution due to an unforeseeable emergency that \nis a severe financial hardship resulting from extraordinary and unforeseeable \ncircumstances beyond the control of the participant.  Finally, the Plan provides for \nvoluntary in-service distributions of Participant\u2019s account balance if the amount is not in \nexcess of the dollar limit provided in section 411(a)(11) (i.e., $5000.00 adjusted for \ninflation) if certain conditions are met. \n \n \nPLR-147002-05 \n \n \n3 \n \n \n \nThe Plan provides for acceptance of transfers of a Participant's account balance \nfrom another eligible deferred compensation plan established and maintained by the \nsame employer as provided for in section 457(e)(10).  The Plan provides for acceptance \nof eligible rollover distributions and the establishment and maintenance of any \nnecessary separate accounts.  The Plan provides for permissive plan to plan transfers \nof all or a portion of a Participant's account: (1) to a defined benefit government plan in \nState X, if the transfer is for the purchase of permissive service credits under the \ndefined benefit governmental plan, or (2) for a repayment to which section 415 does not \napply by reason of section 415(k)(3). \n \nThe Plan provides that amounts of compensation deferred under the Plan are to \nbe transferred to and invested in a trust as described in section 457(g)(1) for the \nexclusive benefit of the participants and their beneficiaries.  All amounts deferred under \nthe Plan must be transferred to the Trust within an administratively reasonable time \nperiod that is not longer than fifteen business days following the end of the month in \nwhich the amount would otherwise have been paid to the Participant.  Neither the \nParticipant nor any Beneficiary shall have any right to sell, assign, transfer, or otherwise \nconvey the right to receive any payments under the Plan. \n \n          County represents that the Plan complies with the requirements of Revenue \nRuling 2004-57, 2004-1 C.B. 1048.  Rev. Rul. 2004-57 provides that an eligible \ngovernmental employer may adopt, for its collectively-bargained employees, a plan \ncreated by the union for employees of the governmental employer and offered and \nadministered by the union, provided that the plan is \u201cestablished and maintained by\u201d the \ngovernmental employer.  The plan must treat all deferrals under all eligible plans of the \nemployer in which an individual participates by virtue of his or her relationship with a \nsingle employer as a single plan for purposes of determining whether deferrals in \nexcess of the section 457(b) limitations have been made.  All eligible plans must have \nthe same normal retirement age.  Eligible plans must share information about the \namount of annual deferrals to other eligible plans of the employer as may be needed for \nproper administration of the plans.  The union must provide such information from an \neligible governmental plan to the governmental employer as may be needed to \ncomplete tax returns for their employees and to administer other eligible plans. \n \nThe Plan has adopted several Model Amendment provisions from Rev. Proc. \n2004-56, 2004-2 C.B. 376, on a word-for-word basis or in a manner that is substantially \nsimilar in all material respects. \n \nSection 457 of the Code provides rules for the deferral of compensation by an \nindividual participating in an eligible deferred compensation plan as defined in section \n457(b). \n \nPLR-147002-05 \n \n \n4 \n \n \n \nSection 457(a)(1)(A) of the Code provides that in the case of a participant in an \neligible governmental deferred compensation plan, any amount of compensation \ndeferred under the plan and any income attributable to the amounts so deferred shall be \nincludible in gross income only for the taxable year in which such compensation or other \nincome is paid to the participant or beneficiary.  Section 457(b) provides that the term \n\"eligible deferred compensation plan\" means a plan established and maintained by an \neligible employer in which only individuals who perform service for the employer may be \nparticipants and which meet the deferral limitations described in section 457(c); which \nmeets the distribution requirements described in section 457(d); which provides for \ndeferral elections described in section 457(b)(4); and, in the case of a governmental \nplan, which requires the plan assets and income to be held in trust for the exclusive \nbenefit of participants and beneficiaries as described in section 457(g). \n \nSection 457(e)(1)(A) provides that the term \"eligible employer\" means a State, \npolitical subdivision of a State, and any agency or instrumentality of a State or political \nsubdivision of a State. \n \nSection 1.457-4(c)(3)(v)(A) of the regulations provides that a plan may define the \nnormal retirement age for purposes of the last-three-years catch-up provision as any \nage that is on or after the earlier of age 65 or the age at which participants have the \nright to retire and receive, under the basic defined benefit pension plan of the State or \ntax-exempt entity (or a money purchase pension plan in which the participant also \nparticipates if the participant is not eligible to participate in a defined benefit plan), \nimmediate retirement benefits without actuarial or similar reduction because of \nretirement before some later specified age, and that is not later than age seventy and a \nhalf.  Alternatively, a plan may provide that a participant is allowed to designate a \nnormal retirement age within these ages.  For purposes of the three-year catch-up \nprovision an entity sponsoring more than one eligible plan may not permit a participant \nto have more than one normal retirement age under the eligible plans it sponsors.  \nSection 1.457-4(c)(3)(v)(B) of the regulations provides a special exception for qualified \npolice and firefighters to retire as early as age forty for purposes of the three-year catch-\nup provision. \n \nSection 1.457-5 of the regulations provides that the section 457(c) eligible  \ndeferral amount limitation is applied to all eligible plans in which a participant \nparticipates in a tax year and is determined on an aggregate basis.  If a participant has \nannual deferrals under more than one eligible plan and the applicable catch-up amount \nis not the same for each such eligible plan for the taxable year, section 457(c) is applied \nusing the catch-up amount under whichever plan has the largest catch-up amount \napplicable to the participant.  To the extent that the combined annual deferral amount \nexceeds the maximum deferral limitation, the amount is treated as an excess deferral \n \nPLR-147002-05 \n \n \n5 \nunder section 1.457-4(e) of the regulations.  For purposes of determining whether there \nis an excess deferral resulting from a failure of a plan to apply the deferral limitations, all \nplans under which an individual participates by virtue of his or her relationship with a \nsingle employer are treated as a single plan (without regard to any differences in \nfunding). \n \nSection 457(d)(1)(A) of the Code provides that amounts distributed under an \neligible plan will not be made available to participants or beneficiaries earlier than (i) the \ncalendar year in which the participant attains age 70 1/2, (ii) when the participant has a \nseverance from employment with the employer, or (iii) when the participant is faced with \nan unforeseeable emergency. \n \nSection 457(d)(2) of the Code requires a plan to meet the minimum distribution \nrequirements of section 401(a)(9).  These requirements are described in Income Tax \nRegulation sections 1.401(a)(9)-1 through 1.401(a)(9)-9. \n \nSection 457(e)(10) of the Code provides that a participant shall not be required to \ninclude in gross income any portion of the entire amount payable to such participant \nsolely by reason of the transfer of such portion from one eligible deferred compensation \nplan to another eligible deferred compensation plan.  Section 1.457-10(b)(1) of the \nregulations provides that an eligible government plan may transfer amounts to, and \nreceive amounts from, another eligible government plan if certain conditions are met. \n \nWith regard to transfers from an eligible governmental plan to another eligible \ngovernmental plan of the same employer, section 1.457-10(b)(4) of the regulations \nprovides that a transfer from an eligible governmental plan to another eligible \ngovernmental plan is permitted if the following conditions are met: (i) the transfer is from \nan eligible governmental plan to another eligible governmental plan of the same \nemployer; (ii) the transferor plan provides for transfers; (iii) the receiving plan provides \nfor the receipt of transfers; (iv) the participant or beneficiary whose amounts deferred \nare being transferred will have an amount deferred immediately after the transfer at \nleast equal to the amount deferred with respect to that participant or beneficiary \nimmediately before the transfer; and (v) the participant or beneficiary whose deferred \namounts are being transferred is not eligible for additional annual deferrals in the \nreceiving plan unless the participant or beneficiary is performing services for the entity \nmaintaining the receiving plan. \n \nSection 457(e)(16) of the Code provides that, with regard to rollover distributions, \nfor an eligible deferred compensation plan if (i) any portion of the balance to the credit of \nan employee in such plan is paid to such employee in an eligible rollover distribution \n(within the meaning of section 402(c)(4)), (ii) the employee transfers any portion of the \nproperty such employee receives in such distribution to an eligible retirement plan \ndescribed in section 402(c)(8)(B), and (iii) in the case of a distribution of property other \nthan money, the amount so transferred consists of the property distributed, then such \n \nPLR-147002-05 \n \n \n6 \ndistribution (to the extent so transferred) shall not be includible in gross income for the \ntaxable year in which paid.  Under section 1.457-10(e) of the regulations, an eligible \ngovernmental plan that permits eligible rollover distributions made from another eligible \nretirement plan to be paid into the eligible governmental plan is required to provide that \nit will separately account for any eligible rollover distributions it receives.  Amounts \ncontributed to an eligible governmental plan as eligible rollover distributions are not \ntaken into account for purposes of the annual limit on annual deferrals by a participant \nbut are otherwise treated in the same manner as amounts deferred under the plan.  \nSection 1.402(c)-2(b) of the regulations provides that a distributee other than the \nemployee or the employee's surviving spouse (or a spouse or former spouse who is an \nalternate payee under a qualified domestic relations order) is not permitted to roll over \ndistributions. \n \nSection 457(e)(17) of the Code provides that no amount shall be includible in \ngross income by reason of a direct trustee-to-trustee transfer to a defined benefit \ngovernmental plan (as defined in section 414(d)) if such transfer is for the purchase of \npermissive service credit (as defined in section 415(n)(3)(A)) under such plan or a \nrepayment to which section 415(k)(3) does not apply. \n \nSection 457(g) of the Code provides that a plan maintained by an eligible \ngovernmental employer shall not be treated as an eligible deferred compensation plan \nunless all assets and rights purchased with such deferred compensation amounts and \nall income attributable to such amounts, property, or rights of the plan are held in trust \nfor the exclusive benefit of participants and their beneficiaries.  Section 457(g)(2)(A) \nprovides that a trust described in section 457(g)(1) shall be treated as an organization \nexempt from tax under section 501(a). \n \nBased upon the information submitted and the representations made, we \nconclude as follows: \n \n1. The Plan is an eligible governmental plan under section 457(b) consistent \nwith Revenue Ruling 2004-57. \n \n \n2. Amounts of compensation deferred in accordance with the Plan, including any \nincome attributable to the deferred compensation, will be includible under \nsection 457(a)(1)(A) of the Code in the recipient\u2019s gross income for the \ntaxable year or years in which amounts are paid to a participant or beneficiary \nin accordance with the terms of the Plan.   \n \nExcept as expressly provided herein, no opinion is expressed or implied \nconcerning the federal tax consequences of any aspect of any transaction or item \ndiscussed or referenced in this letter. If the Plan is significantly modified, this ruling will \nnot necessarily remain applicable. \n \nPLR-147002-05 \n \n \n7 \n \nNo opinion is expressed concerning the timing of the inclusion in income of \namounts deferred under any deferred compensation plan other than the plan described \nabove. In addition, this ruling applies only to deferrals made after the date of this ruling. \n \nThis ruling is directed only to the taxpayer requesting it. Section 6110(k)(3) of the \nCode provides that it may not be used or cited as precedent. \n \n \n \n                                    \n \nSincerely, \n  \n \n \n                                    \n \nRobert D.

This initial election was rejected by the Service, but X\nwas unaware of the rejection until D2.  \nX represents that its shareholders have filed tax returns consistent with X being \nan S corporation for Year 1. X further represents that the circumstances resulting in the \ntermination of X's S corporation election were inadvertent and were not motivated by tax \navoidance or retroactive tax planning. X and its shareholders have agreed to make \nPLR-110851-15\n2\nadjustments consistent with the treatment of X as an S corporation as may be required \nby the Secretary. \nLAW AND ANALYSIS\nSection 1361(a)(1) provides that the term \u201cS corporation\u201d means, with respect to \nany taxable year, a small business corporation for which an election under \u00a7 1362(a) is \nin effect for the year. Section 1361(b)(1) defines a \u201csmall business corporation\u201d as a \ndomestic corporation which is not an ineligible corporation and which does not (A) have \nmore than 100 shareholders, (B) have as a shareholder a person (other than an estate, \na trust described in \u00a7 1361(c)(2), or an organization described in \u00a7 1361(c)(6)) who is \nnot an individual, (C) have a nonresident alien as a shareholder, and (D) have more \nthan 1 class of stock.\nSection 1362(a)(2) provides that an election under this section shall be valid only \nif all persons who are shareholders in such corporation on the day on which such \nelection is made consent to such election.\nSection 1.1362-6(a)(2) provides that a small business corporation makes an \nelection under section 1362(a) to be an S corporation by filing a completed Form 2553. \nThe election form must be filed with the service center designated in the instructions \napplicable to Form 2553. The election is not valid unless all shareholders of the \ncorporation at the time of the election consent to the election in the manner provided in \nparagraph (b) of this section. However, once a valid election is made, new shareholders \nneed not consent to that election.\nSection 1.1362-6(a)(2)(ii)(C) provides, in relevant part, that the taxable year of a \nnew corporation begins on the date that the corporation has shareholders, acquires \nassets, or begins doing business, whichever is the first to occur. The existence of \nincorporators does not necessarily begin the taxable year of a new corporation.\nSection 1.1362-6(b)(1) provides, in relevant part, that a shareholder's consent \nrequired under paragraph (a) of this section must be in the form of a written statement \nthat sets forth the name, address, and taxpayer identification number of the \nshareholder, the number of shares of stock owned by the shareholder, the date (or \ndates) on which the stock was acquired, the date on which the shareholder's taxable \nyear ends, the name of the S corporation, the corporation's taxpayer identification \nnumber, and the election to which the shareholder consents. The statement must be \nsigned by the shareholder under penalties of perjury. The election is not valid if any \nrequired consent is not filed in accordance with the rules contained in this paragraph \n(b). The consent statement should be attached to the corporation's election statement.\nPLR-110851-15\n3\nSection 1362(f) provides, in part, that if (1) an election under \u00a7 1362(a) by any \ncorporation was not effective for the taxable year for which made by reason of a failure \nto meet the requirements of \u00a7 1361(b), (2) the Secretary determines that the \ncircumstances resulting in the ineffectiveness were inadvertent, (3) no later than a \nreasonable period of time after the discovery of the circumstances resulting in the \nineffectiveness, steps were taken so that the corporation for which the election was \nmade is a small business corporation, and (4) the corporation for which the election was \nmade, and each person who was a shareholder in such corporation at any time during \nthe period specified by \u00a7 1362(f), agrees to makes such adjustments (consistent with \nthe treatment of the corporation as an S corporation) as may be required by the \nSecretary with respect to such period, then, notwithstanding the circumstances resulting \nin the ineffectiveness, the corporation is treated as an S corporation during the period \nspecified by the Secretary.\nCONCLUSION\nBased solely on the facts submitted and the representations made, we conclude \nthat X's S corporation election may have been ineffective. We further conclude that, if \nthe election was ineffective, the ineffectiveness was inadvertent within the meaning of         \n\u00a7 1362(f). Therefore, X will be treated as an S corporation effective D1 and thereafter, \nprovided X's S corporation election is not otherwise terminated under \u00a7 1362(d).\nThis ruling is contingent on X filing a corrected Form 2553, Election by a Small \nBusiness Corporation, with the appropriate service center, within 120 days from the \ndate of this letter, effective D1. A copy of this letter should be attached to the election.\nExcept as expressly provided herein, we express or imply no opinion concerning \nthe federal tax consequences of any aspect of any transaction or item discussed or \nreferenced in this letter. Specifically, we express or imply no opinion regarding whether \nX is otherwise eligible to be treated as an S corporation.\nThis ruling is directed only to the taxpayer that requested it. Section 6110(k)(3) of \nthe Code provides that it may not be used or cited as precedent.\nPursuant to a power of attorney on file, we are sending a copy of this letter to X's \nauthorized representatives.\nPLR-110851-15\n4\nThe ruling contained in this letter is based upon information and representations \nsubmitted by the taxpayer and accompanied by a penalty of perjury statement executed \nby an appropriate party. While this office has not verified any of the material submitted \nin support of the ruling request, it is subject to verification on examination.\nSincerely,\nRichard T.

Aside from an introductory period for new players, the Site does \nnot provide games for general entertainment purposes.  After the introductory period, a \nplayer must enroll on the Site and provide the Site with a credit card in order to establish \nan account.  The player makes withdrawals from the account in order to pay the \nrequired entry fees for participation in the tournaments.  Winnings from a tournament \nare credited to the player\u2019s account.  Taxpayer receives a payment for each tournament \nthat is computed as a percentage of the entry fees for that tournament.  Taxpayer also \nreceives revenues from other sources such as on-line advertisement. \n \nThe tournaments are arranged into five categories: \n \n1. ------------------:  These tournaments designate the maximum \nnumber of players accepted into the tournament as well as pre-\nestablished winnings.  These tournaments are also time limited; \nthat is, if the tournament does not fill before it is closed, the leader \nof the tournament is awarded the full prize. \n \n2. ----------------:  These tournaments do not have a limited number of \nplayers, but will terminate at a specified date and time.  Minimum \nprizes are pre-established.  The number of players competing and \n \nPLR-154316-03 \n \n2 \nthe size of potential prizes can increase over the period of \ncompetition.  If the tournament does not fill before it is closed, the \nleader of the tournament is awarded the stated minimum prize.   \n \n3. ------------------:  These are competitions between two individual \nplayers who challenge each other in an agreed upon game.  Upon \nclosure of the tournament, the winner is declared and a \npredetermined prize is awarded. \n \n4. ------------------------------------:  These tournaments operate in the \nsame manner as a ----------------tournament except that Taxpayer \nfurnishes a prize, usually in the form of personal property, such as \na television set. \n \n5. X ------------------:  Players compete against their own past \nperformances.  Those performances are established based on \nhistorical game play scores of the player.  Here again, prizes are \npredetermined. \n \nFor all its tournaments, Taxpayer will pay the specified prizes (whether in cash or \nin kind) to the winning players, as established at the outset of the tournament, and such \nprizes are payable to the winners regardless of the number of players who enter the \ntournament.  Taxpayer states that players competing in each tournament are \ncategorized by skill proficiency in each game, thus allowing Taxpayer to limit \nparticipants in a particular tournament to players of similar skill.  Also, Taxpayer states \nthat it \u201chas developed various mathematical formulas to ensure that all of its games are \nstructured to eliminate the element of chance (other than the element of random chance \ninherent in the game itself)\u201d so that \u201cindividuals who win the tournaments are those \nwhose skills and game-playing strategies are superior to other players.\u201d  Taxpayer \nsuggests that it provides \u201cidentical game circumstances\u201d because in ---------------------\ntournaments, all players will receive the same first \u201chand;\u201d subsequent \u201chands\u201d will be of \nsimilar difficulty, a determination based on a proprietary game rating analysis software.  \nIn ---------------- tournaments, players will receive hands of similar difficulty, again based \non a proprietary game rating analysis software. \n \nTaxpayer recognizes that there are situations it is required to report to the \nService amounts it paid to players during a year.  To comply with the reporting \nrequirements, Taxpayer discusses three possible methods it could use when applying \ninformation reporting requirements to the tournaments.  The methods are as follows: \n \nGross Method:  Under this method, Taxpayer totals up the gross amounts \ncredited to a player\u2019s account during a year, and if the total is $600 or more, \nTaxpayer will report this amount on a Form 1099-MISC. \n \n \nPLR-154316-03 \n \n3 \nNet Method:  With this method, Taxpayer totals up the gross amounts credited to \na player\u2019s account during a year, and subtracts the entry fee from each \ntournament the player received some kind of prize.  Assuming this net amount is \n$600 or more, Taxpayer will report this on a Form 1099-MISC. \n  \nCumulative Net Method:  Under this method, Taxpayer totals up the gross \namounts credited to a player\u2019s account during a year, and subtracts all entry fees \npaid during the year, regardless of whether the player received a prize from that \ntournament.  Assuming this net amount is $600 or more, Taxpayer will report this \non a Form 1099-MISC. \n \nTaxpayer agrees that information reporting under \u00a7 6041 is required for prizes it \npays to winning players, assuming it pays $600 or more in income to a player during a \nyear.  Taxpayer requests a ruling that the proper method of computing income from \ntournament play for information reporting purposes is the cumulative net method.   \n \n \nTaxpayer argues it should be able to deduct all entry fees from income paid by a \nplayer during a year under the cumulative net method.  Under this method, Taxpayer \nsubtracts all entry fees the player pays during a year from the total amount it paid to the \nplayer, and will report this net amount to the Service if it exceeds $600.  Taxpayer \nargues that the cumulative method best reflects deductions the various players would \nbe entitled to pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 162, 165, and/or 183 and, accordingly, best reflects the \nincome paid to a player. \n \nIn the case under consideration, inasmuch as different information returns are \nrequired based on whether the payments are made in a wagering or a non-wagering \ntransaction, it must first be determined whether the game-playing activities in the \ntournaments on the Site operated by Taxpayer constitute wagering or non-wagering \nactivity.  Based on the description of the tournament play, if the activities are to be \nclassified as wagering, they must fall within the definition of either a \u201clottery\u201d or a \n\u201cwagering pool.\u201d  However, these terms are not defined in the Code or regulations \nassociated with federal withholding or reporting requirements.  Thus, it is appropriate to \nlook to dictionaries, court decisions, and other regulatory provisions to ascertain the \nordinary meaning of the terms.  \n \nWagering pool.  The dictionary does not define a wagering pool.  However, \u201cpool\u201d \nis defined as \u201call the money bet by a number of persons on the result of a particular \nevent with the aggregate to be paid to the winner or divided among several winners \naccording to conditions established in advance.\u201d  Webster\u2019s Third New International \nDictionary 1764 (1986).  Similarly, Black\u2019s Law Dictionary defines pool as follows:  \u201cIn \nvarious methods of gambling, a pool is a sum of money made up of the stakes \ncontributed by various persons, the whole of which is then wagered as a stake on the \nevent of a race, game, or other contest, and the winnings (if any) are divided among the \ncontributors to the pool pro rata.  Or it is a sum similarly made up by the contributions of \nseveral persons, each of whom then makes his guess or prediction as to the event of \n \nPLR-154316-03 \n \n4 \nfuture contest or hazard, the successful better taking the entire pool.  Such pools are \ndistinct from the practice of bookmaking.\u201d  Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1161 (6th ed. 1990). \n \n \nUnited States v. Berent, 523 F.2d 1360, 1361 (9th Cir. 1975), notes that in \n\u201ccommon usage the term pool connotes a particular gambling practice, an arrangement \nwhereby all bets constitute a common fund to be taken by the winner or winners.\u201d  State \nv. Duci, 727 P.2d 316, 319 (Ariz. 1986) notes that \u201cpool selling\u201d is generally defined as \n\u201cthe receiving from several persons of wagers on the same event, the total sum of which \nis to be given the winners, subject ordinarily to a deduction of a commission by the \nseller of the pool.\u201d \n   \nIn connection with the tax on certain wagers imposed by \u00a7 4401 of the Code,  \n\u00a7 44.4421-1(c)(1) of the Wagering Tax Regulations provides that a wagering pool \nconducted for profit includes any scheme or method for the distribution of prizes to one \nor more winning bettors based upon the outcome of a sports event or contest, or a \ncombination or series of such events or contests, provided that such wagering pool is \nmanaged and conducted for the purpose of making a profit.  Under \u00a7 44.4421-1(c)(3), a \ncontest includes any type of contest involving speed, skill, endurance, popularity, \npolitics, strength, appearances, etc., such as a general or primary election, the outcome \nof a nominating convention, a dance marathon, a log-rolling, wood-chopping, weight-\nlifting, corn-husking, beauty contest, etc. \n \n \nThus, these authorities suggest that a wagering pool is an arrangement to pool \nbets into a common fund, which are wagered on a sports event or contest, with the \nsuccessful bettor (or bettors) receiving the pool proceeds, subject to the pool sellers \ncommission.  That contrasts with a situation where monies are received as entrance \nfees in order to compete for a preestablished prize offered by a third party that must be \nawarded in any case.  Viewed under these criteria, we find that, although the \ntournaments offered on the Site involve fees paid to enter a contest operated by \nTaxpayer (who anticipates a profit from the endeavor), there does not appear to be an \naggregation of the entrance fees into a common pool all of which (subject to \ncommissions) is to be distributed by Taxpayer to the winner(s).  Here, the minimum \nwinnings or prizes of property are predetermined and must be awarded irrespective of \nthe number of participants or the total of the entrance fees collected.  Thus, the \ntournaments do not fall within a common usage definition of a wagering pool. \n \nLottery.  Webster\u2019s Dictionary defines \u201clottery\u201d as \u201ca scheme for the distribution of \nprizes by lot or chance; esp: a scheme by which prizes are distributed among those \npersons who have paid for a chance to win them usu. as determined by the numbers on \ntickets as drawn at random (as from a lottery wheel).\u201d  Webster\u2019s Third New \nInternational Dictionary 1338 (1986).  Black\u2019s Law Dictionary defines lottery as \u201ca \nchance for a prize for a price.  A scheme for the distribution of a prize or prizes by lot or \nchance, the number and value of which is determined by the operator of the lottery.\u201d  \nBlack\u2019s Law Dictionary 947 (6th ed. 1990). \n   \n \nPLR-154316-03 \n \n5 \nU.S. Postal Service v. Amada, 200 F.3d 647, 651 (9th Cir. 2000), notes that \nwhere there is no applicable statutory definition of the term \u201clottery\u201d, \u201cthe appropriate \ndefinition to apply is the common law lottery definition consistently used by the courts \nand described by the Supreme Court as the traditional tests of chance, prize and \nconsideration.\u201d (internal citations omitted.) \n  \nSection 44.4421-1(b)(1) provides that \u201clottery\u201d includes the numbers game, \npolicy, and similar types of wagering.  In general, a lottery includes any scheme or \nmethod for the distribution of prizes among persons who have paid or promised a \nconsideration for a chance to win such prizes, usually as determined by the number or \nsymbols on tickets drawn from a lottery wheel or other receptacle, or by the outcome of \nan event.  The term also includes enterprises commonly known as \"policy\" or \"numbers\" \nand similar types of wagering where the player selects a number, or a combination of \nnumbers, and pays, or agrees to pay a certain amount in consideration of which the \noperator of the lottery, policy, or numbers game agrees to pay a prize or fixed sum of \nmoney if the selected number or combination of numbers appear or are published in a \nmanner understood by the parties.  Also see Rev. Rul. 57-521, 1957-2 C.B. 779, which \nholds that a puzzle contest participants paid to enter is neither a wagering pool nor a \nlottery for purposes of \u00a7 4401.  The ruling indicates that, as a general rule, contesting \nfor a prize offered by another in a contest of mental or physical skill of the contestant, \nwhich the one offering the prize must award in any event, is not gaming; and the fact \nthat each contestant is required to pay an entrance fee does not make the payment a \nbet or gaming transaction unless the entrance fees alone comprise the prize to be won \nby the successful contestant.   \n \n \nThus, these authorities suggest that, in general terms, a lottery is a scheme to \ndistribute prizes to participants who pay to win the prize by chance.  Taxpayer argues \nthat because, (1) it does not allow players of dissimilar skills to play in the same \ntournament and (2) it uses its game rating analysis software play, the element of chance \nhas been minimalized in its tournament play and, as such, the tournaments lack a key \nrequirement for them to be considered as lotteries.  Based on these representations, we \nbelieve that the tournament games lack the essential element of chance and cannot be \nclassified as a lottery. \n \n \nWith respect to Taxpayer\u2019s reporting requirements, \u00a7 6041 generally requires that \nall persons engaged in a trade or business report on a return all payments of $600 or \nmore to another person made in the course of such trade or business of rent, salaries, \nwages, premiums, annuities, compensations, remunerations, emoluments, or other \nfixed or determinable gains, profits, and income. \n \nSection 1.6041-1(a)(2) of the Income Tax Regulations provides that the returns \nrequired under \u00a7 6041 are Forms 1096 and 1099. \n \nSection 1.6041-1(d) provides that amounts paid as prizes and awards that are \nrequired to be included in gross income under \u00a7 74 and \u00a7 1.74-1 when paid in the \ncourse of a trade or business are required to be reported in returns of information under \n \nPLR-154316-03 \n \n6 \n\u00a7 6041.  In Taxpayer\u2019s situation, prizes are made possible by a player having paid the \nentry fee to that tournament.  Therefore, when the player wins a prize by successfully \ncompeting in one of Taxpayer\u2019s sponsored tournaments, the entry fee to that \ntournament is a return of capital.  See, for example, Rev. Rul. 55-638, 1955-2 C.B. 35, \nwhich holds that proceeds from a sweepstakes ticket acquired by gift before it became a \nwinning ticket is includible in the gross income of the donee to the extent the proceeds \nfrom the sweepstakes exceeds the price paid for the ticket.  Therefore, the amount of \nthe prize includible in gross income is the prize amount net of the fee.  Accordingly, only \nsuch net amounts are considered income for purposes of \u00a7 6041.  \n \nEntry fees for tournaments where a player does not receive a prize, however, are \nnot a return of capital, and cannot be subtracted by Taxpayer when determining the \nincome paid to a player.  Although it is possible that individual players may be entitled to \ndeduct on their respective returns entry fees they paid to Taxpayer, the Code requires \nthe individual players to report all of their income and take all applicable deductions on \ntheir individual tax returns.  There is no authority allowing Taxpayer to effectively take a \ndeduction on behalf of a player by reporting the net amount to the Service on a Form \n1099.  However, no opinion is expressed as to whether a deduction is available or the \ncharacter of the deduction.   \n \nBased on the above, Taxpayer should use the net method in determining which \nplayers it paid $600 or more during a year.  The proper form Taxpayer should use is a \nForm 1099-MISC. \n \nCONSIDERATION OF \u00a7 7805(b)(8) RELIEF \n \n \nTaxpayer requests that this ruling be applicable on a prospective basis only \nunder \u00a7 7805(b)(8).  In support of its request, Taxpayer argues that in the absence of \npublished guidance on this issue, it relied to its detriment on the right to use any \nreasonable method of reporting.   \n \n \nRelief under \u00a7 7805(b)(8) usually is granted only if a taxpayer relied to its \ndetriment on a published position of the IRS or on a letter ruling or technical advice \nmemorandum issued with respect to that taxpayer.  There is no prior letter ruling or \ntechnical advice memorandum to Taxpayer.  Taxpayer relied on its own interpretation of \nthe law.  A taxpayer's erroneous interpretation of the law is not a basis for relief under  \n\u00a7 7805(b)(8). \n \n \nPLR-154316-03 \n \n7 \nThis ruling is directed only to the taxpayer who requested it.  Section 6110(k)(3) \nprovides that this document may not be used or cited as precedent. \n \nSincerely, \n \nAssociate Chief Counsel \n(Passthroughs and Special Industries)  \n \n    By: \n \n \nFrank Boland \nChief, Branch 8 \n \nEnclosures (2): \n \nCopy of this letter \n \nCopy for \u00a7 6110 purposes \n \ncc: \n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Adverse"}]}

----------------:\nThis letter responds to your June 28, 2011 letter requesting rulings on certain \nfederal income tax consequences of the Proposed Transaction (defined below).  The \nmaterial information submitted in that request and in later correspondence is \nsummarized below.\nThe rulings contained in this letter are based on facts and representations \nsubmitted by the taxpayer and accompanied by a penalty of perjury statement executed \nby an appropriate party.  This office has not verified any of the materials submitted in \nsupport of the request for rulings.  Verification of the information, representations, and \nother data may be required as part of the audit process.\nIn particular, this office has not reviewed any information pertaining to, and has \nmade no determination regarding, whether the Internal Distribution or External \nDistribution (each defined below): (i) satisfies the business purpose requirement of \u00a7 \n1.355-2(b) of the Income Tax Regulations ; (ii) is used principally as a device for the \ndistribution of the earnings and profits of Distributing 1, Distributing 2, or Controlled or \nany or all of them (see \u00a7 355(a)(1)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code and \u00a7 1.355-2(d)); \nor (iii) is part of a plan (or series of related transactions) pursuant to which one or more \npersons will acquire directly or indirectly stock representing a 50-percent or greater \ninterest in Distributing 1, Distributing 2, or Controlled (see \u00a7 355(e)(2)(A)(ii) and \u00a7 1.355-\n7).\nSUMMARY OF FACTS\nDistributing 2 is the common parent of an affiliated group whose includible \ncorporations join in filing a consolidated federal income tax return (the \u201cDistributing 2 \nGroup\u201d).  The authorized and outstanding capital stock of Distributing 2 consists of one \nclass of common stock that is publicly traded and widely held (\u201cDistributing 2 Common \nStock\u201d) and one class of preferred stock (\u201cDistributing 2 Preferred Stock\u201d).  Based upon \npublicly available securities information, as of Date 1, Shareholder A, Shareholder B, and \nShareholder C were five percent shareholders of Distributing 2 Common Stock and as of \nDate 2, Shareholder D and Shareholder E were five percent shareholders of Distributing 2 \nPreferred Stock.\nPLR-127348-11\n13\nDistributing 2 wholly owns Sub 1, Sub 2, Sub 3, Sub 4, Sub 5, Sub 6, Sub 7, and \nLLC 1, which is treated as an entity that is disregarded as separate from its owner for \nU.S. federal income tax purposes under \u00a7 301.7701-3 (a \u201cdisregarded entity\u201d), and also \nowns all of the voting interests in Sub 8.  An unrelated individual (\u201cIndividual Third \nParty\u201d) owns all of the non-voting interests in Sub 8, and a third-party bank (the \u201cBank\u201d) \nholds a Sub 8 warrant.  Sub 3 wholly owns Distributing 1, Sub 9, and owns an a% \ninterest in an operating subsidiary the remaining interest of which is owned by a third \nparty.  Distributing 1 wholly owns Sub 10, Sub 11, Sub 12, Sub 13, and various other \noperating subsidiaries.  Sub 4 wholly owns Sub 14 and Sub 15.  Sub 15 owns a b% \ninterest in Partnership 1, which is treated as a partnership for federal income tax \npurposes, the remaining interests in which are held by third parties.  Sub 5 wholly owns \nSub 16, Sub 17, Sub 18, Sub 19, Sub 20, and various other operating subsidiaries.  Sub \n16 owns a c% interest in Partnership 2, which is treated as a partnership for federal \nincome tax purposes, the remaining interests in which are owned d% by Distributing 2 \nand e% by Sub 5.  Sub 17 owns a c% interest in Partnership 3, which is treated as a \npartnership for federal income tax purposes, the remaining interests in which are owned \nd% by Distributing 2 and e% by Sub 5.  Sub 7 wholly owns Sub 21, Sub 22, Sub 23, \nLLC 2, and LLC 3, as well as various other operating subsidiaries and disregarded \nentities.  Each of LLC 2 and LLC 3 is treated as a disregarded entity for federal income \ntax purposes.  Each of Sub 22, Sub 8, and LLC 3 owns various disregarded entities.  \nControlled will be formed by Distributing 1 in connection with the Proposed \nTransaction.  Controlled will be authorized to issue common stock (the \u201cControlled \nCommon Stock\u201d) and preferred stock.\nDistributing 2 and the members of its \u201cseparate affiliated group\u201d as defined in \n\u00a7 355(b)(3)(B) (the \u201cDistributing 2 SAG\u201d) directly engage in Business A (through Sub 9), \nwhich is part of Business B engaged in by the Distributing 2 Group.  Distributing 1 and \nthe members of its \u201cseparate affiliated group\u201d as defined in \u00a7 355(b)(3)(B) (the \n\u201cDistributing 1 SAG\u201d) will, as a result of the Proposed Transaction, directly engage in \nBusiness A (through Sub 9), which is part of Business B engaged in by the Distributing \n2 Group.  Controlled and the members of its \u201cseparate affiliated group\u201d as defined in \n\u00a7 355(b)(3)(B) (the \u201cControlled SAG\u201d) will, as a result of the Proposed Transaction, \ndirectly engage in Business C (through Sub 10), which is part of Business B engaged in \nby the Distributing 2 Group.  \nFinancial information has been submitted indicating that each of Business A and \nBusiness C has had gross receipts and operating expenses representing the active \nconduct of a trade or business for each of the past five years.  \nThe Distributing 2 Group directly or indirectly owns or expects to own prior to \neffecting the Proposed Transaction, the following Type A Facilities:  (i) Facility 3, (ii) \nFacility 4, (iii) Facility 5, (iv) Facility 6, (v) Facility 7, (vi) Facility 8, (vii) Facility 9, (viii) \nPLR-127348-11\n14\nFacility 10, and (ix) Facility 11. Each Type A Facility consists of a Structure 1 (or \nmultiple Structures 1 welded, bolted, or pinned together) that serve as a Structure 2 \nupon which a Structure 3 (or Structures 3) is constructed to serve as a Facility or related \nfacility.  Once each Structure 1 that is intended to serve as a Structure 2 is transported \nto the final facility site, concrete is typically poured across the top of the Structure 1 (or \nStructures 1) to create a level Structure 2 for the Structure 3 (or Structures 3) of the \nFacility or related facility.  Once the Structure 3 is constructed on the Structure 1 (or \nStructures 1), the entire Facility or the related facility resembles a Type 0 Structure 3 \nfrom the outside and inside.  Construction of the Structure 3 (or Structures 3) on each \nType A Facility was subject to local Type 0 Structure 3 codes and performed under the \ndirection of a licensed contractor.  Each remains subject to local Structure 3 and fire \ncodes, is classified as real property for insurance purposes, and is connected to Type 0 \nutilities, e.g., power, water, sewer, and telephone.  None were intended to be moved \nafter the Structures 1 were finally positioned and construction was commenced on the \nStructures 3.\nFollowing the External Distribution, Distributing 2 anticipates that there will be f\noverlapping directors between Distributing 2 and Controlled, and g of the overlapping \ndirectors will serve as Position 1 and Position 2.  In addition, in connection with the \nProposed Transaction, Distributing 2 (and/or its affiliates) and Controlled 2 (and/or its \naffiliates) will enter into certain agreements and arrangements including (i) a separation \nand distribution agreement, (ii) a tax sharing agreement, (iii) an employee matters \nagreement, (iv) a transition services agreement to provide for certain Transition \nServices for a limited period after the External Distribution, (v) an agreement relating to \nintellectual property (which may be a separate agreement or part of the separation and \ndistribution agreement), and (vi) certain other agreements and arrangements as \nappropriate (collectively, the \u201cTransaction Agreements\u201d).   \nAs part of the Proposed Transaction, Controlled will declare and distribute an all \ncash distribution or a distribution consisting of a combination of cash and Controlled \nCommon Stock at the election of each Controlled shareholder as discussed below, in an \namount sufficient to purge all of its E&P accumulated in taxable years prior to its first \ntaxable year as a REIT (the \u201cPurging Distribution\u201d).\nIf the Purging Distribution is not an all cash distribution, each shareholder of \nControlled will be permitted to elect to receive the shareholder\u2019s entire entitlement under \nthe Purging Distribution declaration in either money or Controlled stock of equivalent \nvalue, subject to a limitation on the amount of money to be distributed in the aggregate \nto all Controlled shareholders (the \u201cCash Limitation\u201d).  The Cash Limitation will in no \nevent be less than 20% of the Purging Distribution declaration (without regard to any \ncash that may be paid in lieu of fractional shares).  If too many shareholders elect to \nreceive money, each such electing shareholder will receive a pro rata amount of money \ncorresponding to the shareholder\u2019s respective entitlement under the Purging Distribution \ndeclaration, but in no event will any such electing shareholder receive in money less \nPLR-127348-11\n15\nthan 20% of the shareholder\u2019s entire entitlement.  The calculation of the number of \nshares to be received by any shareholder will be determined, over a period of up to two \nweeks ending as close as practicable to the payment date of the Purging Distribution, \nbased upon a formula utilizing market prices that is designed to equate in value the \nnumber of shares to be received with the amount of money that could be received \ninstead.\nPROPOSED TRANSACTION\nFor what are represented to be valid business purposes, Distributing 2 proposes \nto effect the External Distribution (defined in step (xxxvii)).  The following steps have \nbeen proposed (collectively, the  \u201cProposed Transaction\u201d) to implement the External \nDistribution:\n(i)\nSub 3 will convert to a limited liability company (\u201cLLC\u201d) or merge with and into a \nnewly formed, wholly owned LLC of Distributing 2 (\u201cLLC 4\u201d) that is a disregarded \nentity (the \u201cSub 3 Liquidation\u201d).  LLC 4 will distribute to Distributing 2 a portion of \naccounts receivable respectively owed by Sub 4, Sub 5, and Sub 6.\n(ii)\nDistributing 2 will contribute its partnership interests in Partnership 2 and \nPartnership 3 (the \u201cLP Interests\u201d) to LLC 4, which in turn will contribute the LP \nInterests to Distributing 1.\n(iii)\nSub 12 will convert to an LLC or merge with and into a newly formed, wholly \nowned LLC of Distributing 1 (\u201cLLC 5\u201d) that is a disregarded entity (the \u201cSub 12 \nLiquidation\u201d).\n(iv)\nSub 1 will convert to an LLC or merge with and into a newly formed, wholly \nowned LLC of Distributing 2 (\u201cLLC 6\u201d) that is a disregarded entity (the \u201cSub 1 \nLiquidation\u201d).\n(v)\nSub 2 will convert to an LLC or merge with and into a newly formed, wholly \nowned LLC of Distributing 2 (\u201cLLC 7\u201d) that is a disregarded entity (the \u201cSub 2 \nLiquidation\u201d).\n(vi)\nIn disregarded transactions, all disregarded entities owned by Sub 22 will merge \nwith and into Sub 22.  Sub 22 will then convert to an LLC or merge with and into \na newly formed, wholly owned LLC of Sub 7 (\u201cLLC 8\u201d) that is a disregarded entity \n(the \u201cSub 22 Liquidation\u201d).  Following the Sub 22 Liquidation, LLC 8 will distribute \nall Type 2 Assets to Sub 7.\n(vii)\nSub 7 will convert to an LLC or merge with and into a newly formed, wholly \nowned LLC of Distributing 2 (\u201cLLC 9\u201d) that is a disregarded entity (the \u201cSub 7 \nLiquidation\u201d).\nPLR-127348-11\n16\n(viii)\nSub 16 will convert to an LLC or merge with and into a newly formed, wholly \nowned LLC of Sub 5 (\u201cLLC 10\u201d) that is a disregarded entity (the \u201cSub 16 \nLiquidation\u201d).\n(ix)\nSub 17 will convert to an LLC or merge with and into a newly formed, wholly \nowned LLC of Sub 5 (\u201cLLC 11\u201d) that is a disregarded entity (the \u201cSub 17 \nLiquidation\u201d).\n(x)\nSub 18 will convert to an LLC or merge with and into a newly formed, wholly \nowned LLC of Sub 5 (\u201cLLC 12\u201d) that is a disregarded entity (the \u201cSub 18 \nLiquidation\u201d).\n(xi)\nSub 19 will convert to an LLC or merge with and into a newly formed, wholly \nowned LLC of Sub 5 (\u201cLLC 13\u201d) that is a disregarded entity (the \u201cSub 19 \nLiquidation\u201d).\n(xii)\nSub 20 will convert to an LLC or merge with and into a newly formed, wholly \nowned LLC of Sub 5 (\u201cLLC 14\u201d) that is a disregarded entity (the \u201cSub 20 \nLiquidation\u201d and, together with the Sub 16 Liquidation, the Sub 17 Liquidation, \nthe Sub 18 Liquidation, and the Sub 19 Liquidation, the \u201cSub 5 Subsidiary \nLiquidations\u201d).\n(xiii)\nSub 14 will convert to an LLC or merge with and into a newly formed, wholly \nowned LLC of Sub 4 (\u201cLLC 15\u201d) that is a disregarded entity (the \u201cSub 14 \nLiquidation\u201d).\n(xiv)\nSub 15 will convert to an LLC or merge with and into a newly formed, wholly \nowned LLC of Sub 4 (\u201cLLC 16\u201d) that is a disregarded entity (the \u201cSub 15 \nLiquidation,\u201d and together with the Sub 14 Liquidation, the \u201cSub 4 Subsidiary \nLiquidations\u201d).\n(xv)\nDistributing 2 will contribute a portion of accounts receivable (owed by each \nrespective recipient to Distributing 2 as a result of Step (i)) to each of Sub 4, Sub \n5, and Sub 6 without taking back any shares of stock of each respective recipient \n(the \u201cFirst Receivables Contribution\u201d).  After this Step (xv) with respect to each of \nSub 4, Sub 5, and Sub 6, the fair market value of assets will exceed liabilities.\n(xvi)\nSub 5 will contribute the accounts receivable (owed by each respective recipient \nto Sub 5) to each of Partnership 2 and Partnership 3.\n(xvii)\nThe following mergers will be effectuated:\nPLR-127348-11\n17\na. Sub 5 will merge with and into a newly formed, wholly owned LLC of \nDistributing 1 that is a disregarded entity (\u201cLLC 17\u201d) in constructive \nexchange for Distributing 1 stock (the \u201cSub 5 Cross Chain Merger\u201d).  As a \nresult, each of Partnership 2 and Partnership 3 will dissolve.\nb. Sub 6 will merge with and into a newly formed, wholly owned LLC of \nDistributing 1 that is a disregarded entity (\u201cLLC 18\u201d) in constructive \nexchange for Distributing 1 stock (the \u201cSub 6 Cross Chain Merger\u201d).\nc. Sub 9 will merge with and into a newly formed, wholly owned LLC of \nDistributing 1 that is a disregarded entity (\u201cLLC 19\u201d) in constructive \nexchange for Distributing 1 stock (the \u201cSub 9 Cross Chain Merger\u201d).\nd. Sub 4 will merge with and into a newly formed LLC of Distributing 1 that is \na disregarded entity (\u201cLLC 20\u201d) in constructive exchange for Distributing 1 \nstock (the \u201cSub 4 Cross Chain Merger,\u201d and together with the Sub 5 Cross \nChain Merger, Sub 6 Cross Chain Merger, and Sub 9 Cross Chain \nMerger, the \u201cCross Chain Mergers\u201d).\n(xviii) Each of LLC 10, LLC 11, LLC 12, LLC 13, and LLC 14 will distribute Type 1 \nAssets to LLC 17.  Each of LLC 15 and LLC 16 will distribute Type 1 Assets to \nLLC 20.  Each of LLC 5, LLC 17, LLC 18, LLC 19, and LLC 20 will distribute Type \n1 Assets to Distributing 1.\n(xix)\nDistributing 1 will form Controlled and contribute to Controlled certain assets \n(including all of the stock of Sub 10 and assets distributed to Distributing 1 in \nStep (xviii)) in actual or constructive exchange for Controlled Common Stock and \ncash (the \u201cLoan 1 Proceeds\u201d) that Controlled will borrow from an unrelated \nsyndicate prior to or simultaneously with the contribution of assets (the \u201cFirst \nContribution\u201d).  Distributing 1 will hold the Loan 1 Proceeds in a segregated \nDistributing 1 account pending the distribution of the special dividend.  \nDistributing 1 will declare a special dividend and distribute the Loan 1 Proceeds \nto LLC 4, which in turn will distribute such proceeds to Distributing 2, which will \nhold the Loan 1 Proceeds in a segregated Distributing 2 account.\n(xx)\nDistributing 2 will settle for cash its intercompany obligation to Sub 11.\n(xxi)\nSub 11 will transfer all Type 2 Assets to a newly formed, wholly owned LLC of \nSub 23 (\u201cLLC 21\u201d) that is a disregarded entity (the \u201cSub 11 Sale\u201d) in exchange for \nthe assumption by LLC 21 of the liabilities associated with the transferred assets.\n(xxii)\nDistributing 2 will contribute to LLC 4 all intercompany receivables owed by Sub \n13 to Distributing 2, and LLC 4 will contribute such receivables to Distributing 1, \nwhich will contribute such receivables to the capital of Sub 13 without taking back \nPLR-127348-11\n18\nany additional membership interests of Sub 13 (the \u201cSub 13 Receivables \nContribution\u201d).  As a result, the fair market value of the assets of Sub 13 will \nexceed liabilities of Sub 13.\n(xxiii) Sub 13 will merge with and into a newly formed, wholly owned LLC of Controlled \nthat is a disregarded entity (\u201cLLC 22\u201d) in constructive exchange for shares of \nControlled Common Stock (the \u201cSub 13 Merger\u201d).\n(xxiv) Distributing 1 will contribute to the capital of Sub 11 all open account \nintercompany receivables owed by Sub 11 to Distributing 1 without taking back \nany shares of Sub 11 stock (the \u201cSub 11 Receivables Contribution,\u201d and together \nwith the First Receivables Contribution and the Sub 13 Receivables Contribution, \nthe \u201cReceivables Contribution\u201d).  As a result, the fair market value of the assets \nof Sub 11 will exceed liabilities of Sub 11.\n(xxv)\nSub 11 will merge with and into a newly formed, wholly owned LLC of Controlled \nthat is a disregarded entity (\u201cLLC 23\u201d) in constructive exchange for shares of \nControlled Common Stock (the \u201cSub 11 Merger,\u201d together with the Sub 13 \nMerger, the \u201cControlled Mergers,\u201d and together with the Cross Chain Mergers, \nthe \u201cMergers\u201d).  Following the Sub 11 Merger, Distributing 1 will contribute a note \nowed by Sub 11 to the capital of Controlled, which in turn will contribute such \nnote to LLC 23.\n(xxvi) Distributing 1 will distribute all of the stock of Controlled to LLC 4, which in turn \nwill distribute all of the stock of Controlled to Distributing 2 (the \u201cInternal \nDistribution\u201d).\n(xxvii) Each of LLC 6, LLC 7, and LLC 1 will distribute Type 1 Assets to Distributing 2.\n(xxviii) In disregarded transactions, all disregarded entities owned by Sub 8 will merge \nwith and into Sub 8.  Sub 8 will merge with and into a newly formed, wholly \nowned LLC of Distributing 2 that is treated as a disregarded entity (\u201cLLC 24\u201d) (the \n\u201cSub 8 Liquidation,\u201d and together with the Sub 4 Subsidiary Liquidations, the Sub \n5 Subsidiary Liquidations, the Sub 3 Liquidation, Sub 12 Liquidation, Sub 1 \nLiquidation, Sub 2 Liquidation, and the Sub 7 Liquidation are collectively referred \nto as the \u201cLiquidations,\u201d and each individually, a \u201cLiquidation\u201d).  In connection \nwith the Sub 8 Liquidation any nonvoting membership interests of Sub 8 held by \nIndividual Third Party will be redeemed solely in exchange for cash, and any \nwarrant of Sub 8 held by the Bank is expected to be converted into a warrant for \nan interest in LLC 24 pursuant to the terms of the warrant.  Following the Sub 8 \nLiquidation, in a disregarded transaction LLC 24 will distribute all Type 1 Assets \nto Distributing 2.\nPLR-127348-11\n19\n(xxix) In disregarded transactions all disregarded entities of LLC 3 will merge with and \ninto LLC 3.\n(xxx)\nIn disregarded transactions, LLC 2 will distribute all Type 1 Assets to LLC 9, \nwhich in turn will distribute to Distributing 2 all Type 1 Assets (including all of the \nstock of Sub 21 and the membership interests of LLC 3, and LLC 8).\n(xxxi) In a disregarded transaction, Distributing 2 will contribute to LLC 3 all accounts \nreceivable owed by LLC 3.\n(xxxii) Distributing 2 will contribute to Controlled (i) all Type 1 Assets (including all of the \nstock of Sub 21 and the membership interests of LLC 3 and LLC 8) and (ii) all \nintercompany receivables owed by each of Sub 10 and Sub 21 to Distributing 2 \nin actual or constructive exchange for shares of Controlled Common Stock and \ncash (the \u201cLoan 2 Proceeds\u201d) that Controlled will borrow from an unrelated \nsyndicate prior to or simultaneously with the contribution of assets (the \u201cSecond \nContribution\u201d).  Distributing 2 will hold the Loan 2 Proceeds in a Distributing 2 \nsegregated account.  Distributing 2 will use the Loan 1 and Loan 2 Proceeds to \nrepay external debt (which repayments could include payments of premium, \ninterest and associated fees (such as consent fees), as well as principal).\n(xxxiii) To establish an \u201cUPREIT\u201d structure, Controlled will form a new limited \npartnership that is initially treated as a disregarded entity (\u201cUPREIT LP\u201d), of \nwhich Controlled will be the general partner and a new, wholly owned LLC that is \ntreated as a disregarded entity (\u201cUPREIT LLC\u201d) will be a limited partner.  \nControlled will contribute assets received in the First Contribution, the Controlled \nMergers, and the Second Contribution to UPREIT LP.\n(xxxiv)Any intercompany obligations (not otherwise settled or resolved in other steps) \nthat would result in obligations between the Distributing 2 Group and the \nControlled Group immediately following the External Distribution will be settled.\n(xxxv) Distributing 2 will redeem for cash a portion of the outstanding Distributing 2 \nPreferred Stock (including a portion of the Distributing 2 Preferred Stock held by \nShareholder D).  Additional steps may be taken to ensure that Controlled does \nnot own directly, indirectly, or constructively 10% or more of Distributing 2 stock \nby vote or value following the External Distribution within the meaning of \u00a7 \n856(d)(2)(B), including potential sales or other dispositions of Distributing 2 stock \nby Shareholder C and Shareholder D.  (Certain aspects of this Step (xxxv) may \noccur earlier or later in the sequence of steps, but the redemption of a portion of \nthe Distributing 2 Preferred Stock will in all events occur prior to the External \nDistribution.)\nPLR-127348-11\n20\n(xxxvi)UPREIT LP will contribute all of the stock of the Sub 24 Transferred Entities to \nSub 24 in exchange for all of the stock of Sub 24.\n(xxxvii)\nDistributing 2 will (i) distribute shares of Controlled Common Stock to \nShareholder C in exchange for Distributing 2 Common Stock (the \u201cShareholder C \nExchange\u201d) and (ii) distribute the remaining shares of Controlled Common Stock \npro rata to all other Distributing 2 shareholders (including to Shareholder F with \nrespect to Distributing 2 Preferred Stock) (the \u201cShare Distribution,\u201d and together \nwith the Shareholder C Exchange, the \u201cExternal Distribution\u201d).  The exchange \nratio for the Shareholder C Exchange will be determined closer to the time of the \nExternal Distribution.  Immediately before the External Distribution the shares of \nControlled Common Stock may be recapitalized into the appropriate number of \nshares in order to facilitate the External Distribution.\n(xxxviii) Immediately after the External Distribution, Distributing 2 and UPREIT LP will \nenter into the Master Lease pursuant to which UPREIT LP will lease to \nDistributing 2 the Leased Assets transferred to Controlled, and further transferred \nto UPREIT LP, in connection with the Proposed Transaction.  Prior to entering \ninto the Master Lease, Distributing 2 will contribute LLC 1, LLC 4, LLC 6, LLC 7, \nLLC 9, and LLC 24 to a newly created special purpose entity that will be treated \nas a disregarded entity (\u201cLLC 25\u201d).\n(xxxix)Controlled will make the Purging Distribution by declaring and distributing cash or \na combination of Controlled stock and cash (with the stock portion not to exceed \n80% of the fair market value of such distributions) in an amount sufficient to \npurge all of its E&P accumulated in taxable years prior to its first taxable year as \na REIT.\n(xl)\nOn its first federal income tax return Controlled will elect to become a REIT for \nthe first taxable year ending after the date of the External Distribution (the \u201cREIT \nElection\u201d) and Controlled, together with Sub 24, will jointly elect to have Sub 24 \ntreated as a \u201ctaxable REIT subsidiary\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 856(l) effective on \nthe first day of the first taxable year of Controlled as a REIT.\nAs a result of the Proposed Transaction, Distributing 2 will be a separate, \npublicly-traded operator and manager of Facilities that primarily engages in Business B, \nand Controlled will be a separate, publicly-traded, self-administered, self-managed REIT \nthat primarily engages in Business D by leasing Facilities pursuant to Type C \narrangements.  Following the Proposed Transaction, Distributing 2 (or its subsidiaries) \nwill own under local law (including relevant regulations related to Business B) the \nLicenses and the movable furniture, fixtures, and equipment necessary to operate and \nmanage the Facilities, except for Facility 1 and Facility 2 (including, the associated \nLicenses and movable furniture, fixtures, and equipment necessary to operate and \nmanage Facility 1 and Facility 2) which are owned and operated by Sub 10 and Sub 21 \nPLR-127348-11\n21\n(collectively the \u201cSub 24 Transferred Entities\u201d) whose stock was transferred to \nControlled in the First Contribution and the Second Contribution.   \nFollowing the External Distribution, under a leasing agreement (the \u201cMaster \nLease\u201d) UPREIT LP, as landlord, will generally lease to Distributing 2 (or a subsidiary \nthat is treated as a disregarded entity), as tenant, the Type 1 Assets (excluding the \nassets owned by the Sub 24 Transferred Entities) (the \u201cLeased Assets\u201d).  In addition, \ncertain development facilities will be added to the portfolio of Leased Assets under the \nMaster Lease upon completion.  The Master Lease will be a long-term Type C \narrangement in which Distributing 2 will make payments to UPREIT LP, as landlord, in \nrespect of the Leased Assets.  Under the Master Lease, Distributing 2 (or a subsidiary \nthat is treated as a disregarded entity) will pay UPREIT LP (as defined below) an \namount consisting of (i) a fixed annual base amount (the \u201cBase Rent\u201d), subject to the \nEscalation and Other Adjustments, and (ii) an amount based on the \u201cNet Revenues\u201d (as \ndefined below) from the applicable leased Facility or related facility (the \u201cPercentage \nRent\u201d).\nBase Rent will be a fixed amount for the entire term of the Master Lease, subject \nto the Escalation and Other Adjustments.  Base Rent will be established at the time the \nMaster Lease is executed based on two components.  Subject to the Escalation and \nOther Adjustments, the first component of Base Rent will be calculated based on the \nestimated replacement cost of the leased Facility or related facility, the accumulated \ndepreciation since the last major refurbishment of the leased Facility, and a specified \npercentage yield.  The second component of Base Rent will be calculated with \nreference to the projected \u201cNet Revenues\u201d (as defined below) from the applicable \nFacility or related facility for Year 1 (the \u201cYear 1 Projected Net Revenues\u201d) and will \nequal the product of h% (or i% in the case of Facility 12 and Facility 13) of j% of the \nYear 1 Projected Net Revenues for the applicable Facility or related facility.\nFor the Leased Assets other than Facility 12 and Facility 13, subject to certain \nexceptions pursuant to the Master Lease, Percentage Rent will be fixed for k-year\nperiods during the term of the Master Lease and based on a percentage fixed at the \ntime the Master Lease is executed.  For years l through m, Percentage Rent for such \nLeased Assets will be a fixed amount equal to the product of (a) h% and (b) j% of the \nYear 1 Projected Net Revenues for the applicable Facility or related facility.  The \nPercentage Rent for such Leased Assets will be reset every n years to a fixed amount \nfor the next n-year period equal to the product of (a) h% and (b) the excess (if any) of (i) \nthe average annual \u201cNet Revenues\u201d (as defined below) from the applicable Facility or \nrelated facility for the trailing n-year period over (ii) j% of the Year 1 Project Revenues \n(the \u201cPercentage Rent Allowance\u201d) for such facility.\nFor Facility 12 and Facility 13, Percentage Rent will vary monthly and will be \ncalculated based on actual monthly \u201cNet Revenues\u201d (as defined below) for the \napplicable Facility and a percentage fixed at the time the Master Lease is executed.  \nPLR-127348-11\n22\nMore specifically, the monthly Percentage Rent for Facility 12 and Facility 13 will equal \nthe product of (a) i% and (b) the excess (if any) of (i) the actual \u201cNet Revenues\u201d (as \ndefined below) from the applicable Facility for the applicable month over (ii) 1/12 of the \nPercentage Rent Allowance for the facility.\nFor these purposes, \u201cNet Revenues\u201d means, without duplication, (i) the amount \nreceived by Distributing 2 (and its subsidiaries and sublessees) from patrons at the \napplicable Facility for Activity, less refunds, Specials, and less Returns (the \u201cActivity \nRevenues\u201d); plus (ii) gross receipts of Distributing 2 (and its subsidiaries and \nsublessees), for all goods and merchandise sold, the charges for all services performed, \nor any other revenues generated by Distributing 2 (and its subsidiaries and sublessees) \nin, at, or from the Leased Assets for cash, credit, or otherwise (without reserve or \ndeduction for uncollected amounts), but excluding any Activity Revenues (the \u201cRetail \nSales\u201d); less (iii) the retail value of Services at the applicable Facility (the \u201cPromotional \nAllowance\u201d), in each case subject to certain adjustments with respect to certain \nsubtenants.

P seeks a confirmation of the rulings given to P1 in light of the state-law\nmerger of P and P1 and the sale by A and B to C of membership interests in P.\n2\nPLR-119828-01\nP is a Delaware limited liability company, taxable as a partnership.  P is the\nsurviving entity in a state-law merger with P1, which was undertaken to convert P1 from\na West Virginia limited liability company to a Delaware limited liability company.  Since\nP1 was disregarded as an entity until the merger occurred, and since as a result of the\nmerger, A and B owned identical interests in the profits and capital of P as they had\nowned in P1, P is a continuation of P1 and the state-law merger is ignored for federal\nincome tax purposes.\nP1 constructed, and P now owns and operates, a facility for producing a solid\nsynthetic fuel from coal using a process licensed to P by V.  The Facility is a coal\nagglomeration facility consisting of two production lines located within a single metal\nbuilding.  The Facility was constructed pursuant to two written contracts (one for each\nproduction line) entered into by V with W on Date 2.  V assigned those contracts to P1\nas of Date 3.\nThe Facility was constructed and is operated on property held under lease by B\nand subleased to P under a Sublease (the \u201cSite\u201d).  B has entered into a Feedstock\nSupply Agreement to supply coal feedstock to the Facility.  The coal fines feedstock is\ncurrently supplied exclusively from B\u2019s coal preparation plant operations.  B installed a\nrecovery circuit and vertical filter as a part of its coal preparation plant to recover ultra-\nfine coal.  The ultra-fine coal previously could not be recovered and was part of the\nwaste stream discharge from the coal preparation plant.  One production line will use\nthe ultra-fine coal or a blend of the ultra-fine coal and other coal.  The second\nproduction line will use coal feedstock that is at least 50 percent by weight less than 3/8\ninch.  The product produced by the second production line will not be processed\nthrough the extruders or the dryers at the Facility.  The process flow for the first line will\nbe modified to allow the product to be processed through either dryer.\nP routinely has had experts conduct tests on fuel produced from coal using the\nprocess. Regardless of whether \u201cextrusions\u201d are formed, the experts have concluded\nthat the coal feedstock used at the Facility undergoes a significant chemical change as\na result of the process.\nC acquired an interest in P pursuant to a Purchase and Sale Agreement (\u201cSale\nAgreement\u201d).  P has three separate classes of membership interests (Series A, B and\nC) that share in P\u2019s profits and losses based on annual production volumes.  The\nSeries A Interest is allocated 98% of the first Amount 3 of annual production (\u201cPhase I\u201d)\nand 1% of the production in excess of  Amount 3 per year (\u201cPhase II\u201d).  The Series B\nInterest is allocated 1% of Phase I production and 98% of Phase II production.  The\nSeries C Interest participates in 1% of all production. The Series A, B, and C Interests\nare generally allocated income, gains, losses deductions and section 29 credits\nattributable to their respective percentage interest in Phase I and Phase II production. \nCost recovery deductions are generally allocated 98% to the Series A Interest, 1% to\nthe Series B Interest, and 1% to the Series C Interest.  P has represented that\nallocation and distributions pursuant to the Sale Agreement will have substantial\n3\nPLR-119828-01\neconomic effect as required by section 1.704-1(b)(2) of the Income Tax Regulations.\nPursuant to the Sale Agreement, C purchased the Series A Interest from A and\nB and received an option to purchase the Series B Interest.  In exchange for the Series\nA Interest, A and B received an amount of cash at closing, a fixed recourse promissory\nnote, and a contingent promissory note.\nThe remaining facts are the same as stated in PLR 199904027.\nThe rulings issued in PLR 199904027, which you wish to be reconfirmed in this private\nletter ruling, are as follows (with P being substituted for P1):\n1.\nP, with use of the process, produces a \u201cqualified fuel\u201d within the meaning of\nsection 29(c)(1)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code.\n2.\n Production of qualified fuel from the Facility is attributable to P within the\nmeaning of section 29(a)(2)(B).\n3.\n P is entitled to the section 29 credits for the production of the qualified fuel from\nthe Facility that is sold to an unrelated person.\n4.\n Each of the contracts for construction of the Facility constitute a \u201cbinding written\ncontract\u201d within the meaning of section 29(g)(1)(A).\n5.\n The credit allowed under section 29 may be passed through to and allocated\namong all the members of P in accordance with the member\u2019s interest in P under the\nprinciples of section 702(a)(7).  For the section 29 credit, a member\u2019s interest in P is\ndetermined based on a valid allocation of the receipts from the sale of qualified fuel.\n6.\nBecause the Facility was \u201cplaced in service\u201d before July 1, 1998 within the\nmeaning of section 29(g)(1), the Facility will continue to be treated as placed in service\nbefore July 1, 1998, after the technical termination of P under section 708(b)(1)(B) on\nDate 4, upon the purchase of the Series A Interest by C from A and B.\n7.\nA future termination of P under section 708(b)(1)(B) will not preclude the new\npartnership from taking the section 29 credit for the production of qualified fuel from the\nFacility that is sold to an unrelated person.\n8.\nBecause the Facility was \u201cplaced in service\u201d prior to July 1, 1998 within the\nmeaning of section 29(g)(1), relocation of the Facility after June 30, 1998, will not result\nin a new placed in service date for the Facility for purposes section 29 provided the\nessential components are relocated, the fair market value of the original property is\nmore than 20 percent of the Facility\u2019s total fair market value at the time of relocation,\nand the production capacity of the relocated Facility is not significantly increased at the\nnew location.\n4\nPLR-119828-01\nThe changes in facts since the issuance of PLR 199904027 are the merger\nwhich left P the remaining entity, the sale of an interest to C, and the plans to use\nminus 3/8\" feedstock in one of the production lines that will eliminate the extruder and\ndryer. \nThe above rulings are not affected by the merger nor the sale of an interest to C. \nYou have requested rulings regarding whether a change in feedstock and the\nelimination of a process step for one production line would affect the above rulings.\nSection 3 of Rev. Proc. 2001-34, 2001-22 I.R.B. 1293, provides that the Service\nwill issue rulings that a solid fuel (other than coke) produced from coal is a qualified fuel\nunder section 29(c)(1)(C) if the conditions set forth below are satisfied and evidence is\npresented that all, or substantially all, of the coal used as feedstock undergoes a\nsignificant chemical change.  The use of coal particles the majority of which, by weight,\nare no larger than 3/8\" are permitted.  The taxpayer is also permitted to eliminate  the\nuse of the extruder provided the taxpayer represents that omission of this procedure will\nnot significantly increase production of the facility.\nSection 29(f)(1)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code provides that the credit is\navailable with respect to solid synthetic fuel from coal that is produced in a facility\nplaced in service after December 31, 1979 and before January 1, 1993.\nSection 29(g) provides that a facility for producing solid synthetic fuel from coal is\ntreated as being placed in service before January 1, 1993, if such facility is placed in\nservice before July 1, 1998, pursuant to a binding written contract in effect before\nJanuary 1, 1997.\nGenerally, the specifications of the binding written contracts required by section\n29(g) provide for construction of facilities with an \u201cexpected\u201d or \u201ctarget\u201d level of\nproduction of qualified fuel at the time the facility is placed in service.  This level of\nproduction is evidenced by such factors as the size of conveyers, mixers, briquetters,\nheaters, and other equipment installed in the facility as well as production levels\npermitted by governmental entities or indicated in feedstock supply or qualified fuel\nsales contracts.  This expected production level will depend upon which of the various\navailable qualified fuel technologies is utilized, the type of coal feedstock, configuration\nof the elements of the facility, speed of operation of each piece of equipment, and the\nsize and shape of the resultant qualified fuel.\nThe Service has generally issued private letter rulings regarding whether a\nfacility produces a qualified fuel based upon taxpayers\u2019 representations that the facility\nconstructed under the binding contract implements a process that results in a fuel\nproduct that differs chemically from coal to a significant degree.  Thus, the rulings are\npredicated upon the cumulative effects of a specific set of activities applied under\ncontrolled conditions for a specified period of time and at a specified rate.  \nIn Revenue Procedure 2001-30, 2001-19 I.R.B. 1163, the Service announced\n5\nPLR-119828-01\nthat it will issue rulings that a solid fuel produced from coal is a qualified fuel under\nsection 29(c)(1)(C) under the circumstances enumerated therein.  Because of the\ndegree to which all of the activities of the facility are impacted by changes in the speed\nof operation and because changes to a facility may affect the placed in service\nrequirements, the Service appropriately indicated that rulings would not be issued\nwhere a facility was modified after July 1, 1998 in a manner that would significantly\nincrease the capacity of the facility to produce qualified fuel beyond the expected\ncapacity contemplated in the binding contract.\nYou have requested a ruling that the process implemented in the facility that you\nhave described results in a solid synthetic fuel produced from coal that is a qualified\nfuel for purposes of section 29 of the Code.  We have previously ruled that the\nunmodified production line produces a qualified fuel.  Based upon the facts presented\nand the representations made in your request, we conclude that the modified\nproduction line using the process that you have described results in a fuel that is a\nqualified fuel provided that that production line is not operated at a level of production\nthat will exceed the annualized expected production level provided in the binding\ncontract for the construction of that production line.\nWith addition of the above caveat for production from the modified production\nline, we re-issue the rulings given in PLR 199904027 for P.  Thus in summary:\n1.\nP, with use of the process, produces a \u201cqualified fuel\u201d within the meaning of\nsection 29(c)(1)(C).\n2.\n Production of qualified fuel from the Facility is attributable to P within the\nmeaning of section 29(a)(2)(B).\n3.\n P is entitled to the section 29 credits for the production of the qualified fuel from\nthe Facility that is sold to an unrelated person.\n4.\n Each of the contracts for construction of the Facility constitutes a \u201cbinding\nwritten contract\u201d within the meaning of section 29(g)(1)(A).\n5.\n The credit allowed under section 29 may be passed through to and allocated\namong all the members of P in accordance with the member\u2019s interests in P under the\nprinciples of section 702(a)(7).  For the section 29 credit, a member\u2019s interest in P is\ndetermined based on a valid allocation of the receipts from the sale of qualified fuel.\n6.\nBecause the Facility was \u201cplaced in service\u201d before July 1, 1998 within the\nmeaning of section 29(g)(1), the Facility will continue to be treated as placed in service\nbefore July 1, 1998, after the termination of P under section 708(b)(1)(B) on Date 4,\nupon the purchase of the Series A Interest by C from A and B.\n7.\nA future termination of P under section 708(b)(1)(B) will not preclude the new\n6\nPLR-119828-01\npartnership from taking the section 29 credit for the production of qualified fuel from the\nFacility that is sold to an unrelated person.\n8.\nBecause the Facility was \u201cplaced in service\u201d prior to July 1, 1998 within the\nmeaning of section 29(g)(1), relocation of the Facility after June 30, 1998, will not result\nin a new placed in service date for the Facility for purposes of section 29 provided the\nessential components are relocated, the fair market value of the original property is\nmore than 20 percent of the Facility\u2019s total fair market value at the time of relocation,\nand the production capacity of the relocated Facility is not significantly increased at the\nnew location.\nThis ruling is directed only to the taxpayer who requested it.  Section 6110(k)(3) \nprovides that it may not be used or cited as precedent.  A copy of this ruling should be\nattached to your tax return filed for the year in which the transaction covered by this\nruling was consummated.

Pursuant to the directions in \nDecedent\u2019s Last Will and Testament, insurance, jointly-owned property, and an annuity \ncollectively valued at $s passed to Spouse.  Cash, stocks, bonds, real estate and oil \nroyalties valued at $t passed to Child 1, Child 2, and Child 3 subject to Spouse\u2019s life \nestate in one-half of the interests.  Finally, $u passed to Family Trust, a credit shelter \ntrust.   \n \nPLR-153074-03 \n \n2 \n \nThe Form 706 filed for the decedent\u2019s estate was the July 1990 revision that is to \nbe filed for decedents dying after December 31, 1989, and before January 1, 1993.  \nSchedule M states: \n \nTerminable Interest (QTIP) Marital Deduction. \u2013 If you elect to claim a \nmarital deduction for qualified terminable interest property (QTIP) under \n\u00a7 2056(b)(7), you MUST list on Part 2 of Schedule M all of the property for \nwhich you are making the election.  Listing property on Part 2 constitutes \nthe making of the QTIP election.  No marital deduction will be allowed for \nany terminable interest property that is listed on Part 1 of Schedule M. \n \n \nUnder Part 1 of Schedule M, entitled \u201cProperty Interests Which Are Not Subject \nto a QTIP Election,\u201d Decedent\u2019s executor listed property interests passing to spouse \nvalued at $w.  $w is the sum of $s and the actuarial value of Spouse\u2019s interest in $t and \n$u.  The taxpayer claimed a marital deduction for the full value of $w even though $t \nand $u actually passed to Child 1, Child 2, Child 3, and Family Trust and spouse only \nhad a nondeductible terminable interest in those assets.  Nothing was listed under Part \n2 of Schedule M entitled \u201cProperty Interests Which Are Subject to a QTIP Election.\u201d  No \nreference to \u2018qualified terminable interest property,\u2019 \u2018QTIP,\u2019 or \u2018QTIP election\u2019 was made \nby the estate on Schedule M or at any other place on the return. \n \n \nYou have asked that we disregard the deduction taken with respect to the \nactuarial value of Spouse\u2019s interest in $t and $u on Decedent\u2019s Form 706 and treat it as \nnull and void for purposes of \u00a7\u00a7 2044(a), 2056(b), 2519(a), and 2652. \n \n \nSection 2056(a) provides that the value of a decedent\u2019s taxable estate shall be \ndetermined by deducting from the value of the gross estate an amount equal to the \nvalue of any interest in property that passes or has passed from the decedent to the \nsurviving spouse. \n \n \nSection 2056(b)(1) provides that a deduction is not allowed for terminable \ninterests that pass to the spouse.  An interest is a terminable interest if the interest \npassing to the surviving spouse will terminate or fail on the lapse of time or on the \noccurrence of an event or contingency or on the failure of an event or contingency to \noccur, and on termination, an interest in the property passes to someone other than the \nsurviving spouse.   \n \n \nSection 2056(b)(7)(A) provides that qualified terminable interest property shall be \ntreated as passing to the surviving spouse and no part of such property shall be treated \nas passing to any person other than the surviving spouse.  Thus, the value of such \nproperty is deductible from the value of the gross estate under \u00a7 2056(a) and is not \ntreated as a terminable interest.  Under \u00a7 2056(b)(7)(B)(i), qualified terminable interest \nproperty is property that passes from the decedent, in which the surviving spouse has a \nqualifying income interest for life, and to which an election under \u00a7 2056(b)(7)(B)(v) \napplies. \n \nPLR-153074-03 \n \n3 \n \n \nSection 2056(b)(7)(B)(v) provides that an election under \u00a7 2056(b)(7) with \nrespect to any property shall be made by the executor on the return of tax imposed by \n\u00a7 2001.  Such an election, once made, shall be irrevocable. \n \n \nA QTIP election has transfer tax consequences for the surviving spouse.  Section \n2044(a) and (b) provides generally that the value of the gross estate includes the value \nof any property in which the decedent has a qualifying income interest for life and with \nrespect to which a deduction was allowed for the transfer of the property to the \ndecedent under \u00a7 2056(b)(7).  Under \u00a7 2519(a) and (b), any disposition of all or part of a \nqualifying income interest for life in any property with respect to which a deduction was \nallowed under \u00a7 2056(b)(7) is treated as a transfer of all interests in the property other \nthan the qualifying income interest.  Further, the surviving spouse will, in the absence of \na \u201creverse QTIP\u201d election under \u00a7 2652(a)(3), be treated as the transferor of the \nproperty for generation-skipping transfer tax purposes under \u00a7 2652(a). \n \n \nIn the case of a QTIP election to which Rev. Proc. 2001-38, 2001-24 C.B. 1335, \napplies, the Service will disregard a QTIP election made under \u00a7 2056(b)(7) and treat it \nas null and void for purposes of \u00a7\u00a7 2044(a), 2056(b)(7), 2519(a), and 2652.  Rev. Proc. \n2001-38 applies to QTIP elections under \u00a7 2056(b)(7) where the election was not \nnecessary to reduce the estate tax liability to zero, based on values as finally \ndetermined for federal estate tax purposes.  Rev. Proc. 2001-38 does not apply in \nsituations where a partial QTIP election was required with respect to a trust to reduce \nthe estate tax liability and the executor made the election with respect to more trust \nproperty than was necessary to reduce the estate tax liability to zero; nor does it apply \nto elections that are stated in terms of a formula designed to reduce the estate tax to \nzero. \n \n \nIn Estate of Higgins v. Commissioner, 91 T.C. 61 (1988), aff\u2019d, 897 F.2d 856 (6th \nCir. 1990), the estate filed a June 1982 revision of the Form 706, and checked the \u201cNo\u201d \nbox in response to the question whether the estate was making a QTIP election.  On \nSchedule M, the estate deducted the value of the spouse\u2019s life estate in a residuary \ntrust, and on Schedule O the estate deducted the value of the remainder interest in the \ntrust passing to charity.  The estate argued that the entries on the return were sufficient \nto constitute a QTIP election.  The Tax Court ruled that because the QTIP election \ncarries with it burdens as well as the benefit of a marital deduction, the return and the \nattached schedules must evidence \u201can unequivocal manifestation of an affirmative \nintent\u201d to elect QTIP treatment in order to qualify for the marital deduction.  In Estate of \nHiggins, the court found that there was no clear manifestation of an affirmative intent to \nmake the QTIP election on the estate tax return.  Accordingly, the court concluded that \nthe estate had not effectively elected QTIP treatment.  The Sixth Circuit affirmed the \nTax Court\u2019s decision in Estate of Higgins with similar reasoning.  The Sixth Circuit \nstated, \u201cthe intent of \u00a7 2056(b)(7) is that the election must be unequivocally \ncommunicated on the estate tax return\u2026\u201d  Estate of Higgins, 897 F.2d at 859-60. \n \n \nPLR-153074-03 \n \n4 \n \nRev. Proc. 2001-38 applies only when a valid QTIP election was made on a \ndecedent\u2019s estate tax return.  As explained by the Tax Court in Estate of Higgins, in \norder to make a valid QTIP election under \u00a7 2056(b)(7)(B)(v), an estate must make an \nunequivocal manifestation of an affirmative intent to make the election of QTIP \ntreatment on the estate tax return.\u201d  Estate of Higgins, 91 T.C. at 69.  The instructions \nfor the Form 706 in general as well as those specifically for Schedule M are sufficiently \ndetailed with regard to the QTIP election so that the preparer of the form should have \nbeen adequately aware that taking a marital deduction for terminable interest property \nrequires the making of a QTIP election.  However, in this case, the property for which a \ndeduction was claimed was listed on the schedule specifically designated for listing \nproperty other than QTIP property.  Further, there was no other indication of any type \nthat a QTIP election was to be made.  We can only conclude that, as of the filing of \ndecedent\u2019s Form 706, a QTIP election was not made with respect to the actuarial value \nof Spouse\u2019s interest in $t and $u.  As stated in Estate of Higgins, \u201cthe essence of the \nelection requirement is that the executor of the estate of the spouse first to die \nunequivocally communicate his election\u2026\u201d  Id. at 70.  Here, there was no such \nindication made.  Since a QTIP election was not made on Decedent\u2019s Form 706, \nDecedent\u2019s estate does not qualify for relief under Rev. Proc. 2001-38.   \n \n \nIn conjunction with the receipt of this letter, Spouse must file a supplemental \nForm 706 properly reporting the assets to be included on Schedule M and the correct \nbeneficiaries and amounts on Part 4, Line 5.  According to the information provided, the \ntentative estate tax on Decedent\u2019s taxable estate, if reported correctly, is less than \nDecedent\u2019s available unified credit against the estate tax.  A copy of this letter should be \nattached to the supplemental Form 706 and filed with the Internal Revenue Service \nCenter, Cincinnati, Ohio 45999.  A copy is included for this purpose. \n \n \nExcept as expressly provided herein, no opinion is expressed or implied \nconcerning the federal tax consequences of any aspect of any transaction or item \ndiscussed or referenced in this letter. \n \n \nThe rulings contained in this letter are based upon information and \nrepresentations submitted by the taxpayer and accompanied by a penalty of perjury \nstatement executed by an appropriate party.

There currently are eight Year 1 trusts remaining with trustor\u2019s\ngrandchildren as the sole current income beneficiaries.  Each trust owns undivided\ninterest in a assets and substantial portfolio of investment securities and will terminate\nupon the earlier of the death of the grandchild or 21 years after the death of the last\nchild.\nDuring the early Year 2, the Corporate Trustee became increasingly concerned that the\norderly control of the a assets might be seriously disrupted if undivided interests passed\nout of the common control upon the death of a third generation income beneficiary and\nthe resulting trust terminated. In Year 3, the Trustee decided to contribute all of the a \nassets to a partnership.\nThe Partnership\u2019s original Limited Partnership Agreement (LPA) was executed on Date\n1, and obligated each of the partners to contribute their a assets to the Partnership in\nexchange for limited partnership interests.  Due to the Trustee\u2019s concern that certain\nbeneficiaries of the trusts would oppose the limited partnership agreement, the\nagreement was made contingent upon obtaining court approval.  It was also made\ncontingent upon obtaining a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service that the\npartnership was a partnership for federal tax purposes; this requirement was\nsubsequently eliminated as unnecessary after the promulgation of the regulations under\nsections 301.7701-1 through 301.7701-3.  \nThe state court litigation took several years to resolve.  Ultimately, on Date 2, the court\nentered an order requiring the Trustee to execute a LPA substantially similar to the\nAmended and Restated LPA previously submitted to the court.  Although the Amended\nand Restated LPA contained numerous changes from the original LPA no change was\nmade to the partners\u2019 obligation to contribute their a assets to the partnership. The\ncourt authorized the Trustee to make further changes to the Amended and Restated\nLPA prior to the formation of the partnership, subject to the right of an interested party\nto object and hearing by the court.  \nThe Final LPA, which contained minor changes to the Amended and Restated LPA,\nwas executed by all parties on Date 3.  The partnership was formed, and the a assets\nwere contributed to the partnership on Date 4.  Although the execution of the Final LPA\ncould have occurred any time after Date 2, Date 3 was chosen because that was the\ndate on which interested trust beneficiaries, the trustee and persons involved in\nmanaging the a assets have traditionally met.  In addition, the Trustee wanted to utilize\nthe interim period to make sure that all administrative details were given proper\nattention, including necessary changes to computer systems and accounting\nprocedures.  Date 2 is prior to June 8, 1997, and Date 4 is subsequent to it.\nLAW AND ANALYSIS \nSection 1063 of the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, extended from 5 to 7 years the period\n3\nPLR-133382-01\nduring which precontribution gain is recognized if property contributed to a partnership\nis distributed in-kind.  The amendment applies to property contributed to a partnership\nafter its June 8, 1997 effective date.  It does not apply, however, to any property\ncontributed pursuant to a written binding contract in effect on June 8, 1997, and at all\ntimes thereafter before such contribution if such contract provides for the contribution of\na fixed amount of property.  \nCONCLUSION \nBased solely on the facts submitted and the representations made, we conclude that\nthe Partners of X had a binding contract in effect on June 8, 1997, to contribute a\nassets to X.  Accordingly, we conclude that Section 1063 of the Taxpayer Relief Act of\n1997, does not apply and that A will not recognize pre-contribution gain under section\n704(c)(1)(B) or section 737(b)(1) as a result of the in-kind distribution of a assets on or\nafter Date 5.\nExcept as specifically set forth above, no opinion is expressed or implied as to\nthe federal income tax consequences of the transaction described above under any\nother provision of the Code.\nThis ruling is directed only to the taxpayer requesting it.

Taxpayer acquired Relinquished Property on Date 1 and held it as rental \nproperty.  In Taxpayer\u2019s possession, Relinquished Property\u2019s fair market value \nsubstantially increased.   \n \nRelated Party wished to acquire Relinquished Property from Taxpayer, and \nTaxpayer wished to transfer Relinquished Property to Related Party through a like-kind \nexchange pursuant to \u00a7 1031.  However, because Related Party did not own like-kind \nassets that Taxpayer wished to acquire, Taxpayer entered into an agreement with an \nunrelated third party to acquire Replacement Property.  Replacement property is like-\nkind to Relinquished Property within the meaning of \u00a7 1031(a) and \u00a7 1.1031(a)-1(b).  \nReplacement Property\u2019s fair market value was substantially higher than Relinquished \nProperty\u2019s fair market value.  The unrelated third party required the closing of the sale of \nReplacement Property to occur before Taxpayer transferred Relinquished Property to \nRelated Party, and accordingly, Taxpayer structured the transaction as a \u201creverse\u201d like-\nkind exchange under the provisions of Rev. Proc. 2000-37, 2002-2 C.B. 308, modified \nby Rev. Proc. 2004-51, 2004-2 C.B. 294.   \n \nOn Date 2, Taxpayer and E Corp. entered into a qualified exchange \naccommodation arrangement described in Rev. Proc. 2000-37.  E Corp. is a domestic \nsingle-owner limited liability company and wholly owned by D Corp.  E Corp. is \ndisregarded as a separate taxpayer pursuant to \u00a7 301.7701-3(b)(1)(ii) and has never \nmade nor intends to make an election under \u00a7 301.7701-3(c)(1) to be taxed as an \n \nPLR-126651-06 \n \n \n \n3 \nassociation.  D Corp. and E Corp. are unrelated to Taxpayer and Related Party.  In this \nreverse like-kind exchange, E Corp. functioned as an exchange accommodation \ntitleholder (\u201cEAT\u201d).   \n \nIn addition, on the same day, Taxpayer loaned to E Corp. $A, which is equal to \nthe purchase price of Replacement Property, and D Corp. granted Taxpayer a security \ninterest in 100-percent of the membership interest in E Corp. as collateral for \nTaxpayer\u2019s loan to E Corp.  E Corp. purchased the Replacement Property for $A on \nDate 3. \n \nOn Date 4, Taxpayer entered into an agreement with Related Party to transfer \nRelinquished Property to Related Party\u2019s wholly owned subsidiary, Limited Liability Co.  \nConcurrently, Taxpayer and F Corp., which is an affiliate of D Corp., entered into an \nagreement to assign Taxpayer\u2019s right to receive Relinquished Property sales proceeds, \n$B, to F Corp.  F Corp. is a qualified intermediary (\u201cQI\u201d) described in \u00a7 1.1031(k)-\n1(g)(4), and not a \u201cdisqualified person\u201d with respect to Taxpayer within the meaning of   \n\u00a7 1.1031(k)-1(k).  Pursuant to the agreements, Taxpayer transferred Relinquished \nProperty to Limited Liability Co., and Limited Liability Co. paid $B to F Corp.   \n \nTo complete the exchange, Taxpayer instructed F Corp. to acquire Replacement \nProperty.  Accordingly, F Corp. purchased 100-percent of the membership interest in E \nCorp. from D Corp., subject to E Corp.\u2019s obligation under the loan, for $B.  At F Corp.\u2019s \ndirection, D Corp. transferred the E Corp.\u2019s membership interest to Taxpayer and also \ntransferred $B to Taxpayer to pay down the loan.  Because E is a disregarded entity for \nfederal tax purposes, a transfer of all the interest in E Corp. is treated as a transfer of \nthe assets of E Corp.  As a result, the outstanding balance of the loan was cancelled \nbecause Taxpayer in effect became both the debtor and the creditor with respect to \nsuch balance.   \n \nAfter the above-transactions, Taxpayer held Replacement Property and Related \nParty held Relinquished Property.  Related Party intends to dispose Relinquished \nProperty within two years of its receipt.       \n \nLAW AND ANALYSIS \n \nApplicable Requirements for Deferral under \u00a7 1031. \n \nSection 1031 was initially promulgated to avoid taxing gains that were mere \n\u201cpaper profits,\u201d i.e., the taxpayer had realized nothing tangible and to tax them seriously \ninterfered with normal business adjustments.  Revenue Act of 1934, Sec. 112.   \n \nSection 1031(a)(1) generally provides that no gain or loss shall be recognized on \nthe exchange of property held for productive use in a trade or business or for \n \nPLR-126651-06 \n \n \n \n4 \ninvestment if such property is exchanged solely for property of like-kind which is to be \nheld either for productive use in a trade or business or for investment. \n \n \nIn arranging the like-kind exchange, \u00a7 1.1031(k)-1(g)(4) allows taxpayers to use \na QI to facilitate a like-kind exchange.  A taxpayer\u2019s transfer of relinquished property to \na QI and subsequent receipt of like-kind replacement property from the QI is treated as \nan exchange with the QI. \n \nSection 1031(f) was subsequently enacted to accord nonrecognition treatment \nonly to exchanges and conversions where a taxpayer can be viewed as merely \ncontinuing his investment.  If a related party exchange is followed shortly thereafter by a \ndisposition of the property, the related parties have, in effect, \u201ccashed out\u201d of the \ninvestment, and the original exchange would not be accorded nonrecognition treatment.  \nSee H.R. REP. NO. 101-247, at 1341 (1989), reprinted in 1989 U.S.C.C.A.N. 1906, 2811. \n \nSection 1031(f)(1) sets forth special rules for exchanges between related \npersons.  Section 1031(f)(1) provides that if (1) a taxpayer exchanges property with a \nrelated person, (2) nonrecognition treatment is offered to the taxpayer in accordance \nwith \u00a7 1031 with respect to the exchange, and (3) within two years of the date of the last \ntransfer either the taxpayer or the related person disposes of the property received in \nthe exchange, then there is no nonrecognition of gain or loss in the exchange.  In other \nwords, the gain or loss that was deferred under \u00a7 1031 must be recognized as of the \ndate of the disposition of the property received in the exchange.   \n \nSection 1031(f)(2) provides that certain dispositions will not be taken into account \nfor purposes of \u00a7 1031(f)(1).  These include any disposition (1) after the earlier of the \ndeath of the taxpayer or the death of the related person, (2) in a compulsory or \ninvoluntary conversion (within the meaning of \u00a7 1033) if the exchange occurred before \nthe threat or imminence of such conversion, or (3) with respect to which it is established \nto the satisfaction of the Secretary that neither the exchange nor such disposition had \nas one of its principal purposes the avoidance of Federal income tax.   \n \nSection 1031(f)(4) provides that \u00a7 1031 shall not apply to any exchange that is \npart of a transaction, or series of transactions, structured to avoid the purposes of         \n\u00a7 1031(f).  Thus, if a transaction is set up to avoid the restrictions of \u00a7 1031(f),               \n\u00a7 1031(f)(4) operates to prevent nonrecognition of the gain or loss in the exchange.   \n \nBoth the Ways and Means Committee Report and the Senate Finance \nCommittee Print describe the policy concern that led to enactment of \u00a7 1031(f)(4): \n \nBecause a like-kind exchange results in the substitution of the basis of the \nexchanged property for the property received, related parties have engaged in \n \nPLR-126651-06 \n \n \n \n5 \nlike-kind exchanges of high basis property for low basis property in anticipation of \nthe sale of the low basis property in order to reduce or avoid the recognition of \ngain on the subsequent sale.  Basis shifting also can be used to accelerate a loss \non retained property.  The committee believes that if a related party exchange is \nfollowed shortly thereafter by a disposition of the property, the related parties \nhave, in effect, \u2018cashed out\u2019 of the investment, and the original exchange should \nnot be accorded nonrecognition treatment.   \n \n \n. . . .  \n \nNonrecognition will not be accorded to any exchange which is part of a \ntransaction or series of transactions structured to avoid the purposes of the \nrelated party rules.  For example, if a taxpayer, pursuant to a prearranged plan, \ntransfers property to an unrelated party who then exchanges the property with a \nparty related to the taxpayer within 2 years of the previous transfer in a \ntransaction otherwise qualifying under section 1031, the related party will not be \nentitled to nonrecognition treatment under section 1031.  \n \nH.R. REP. NO. 101-247, at 1340-41 (1989), reprinted in 1989 U.S.C.C.A.N. 1906, 2810-\n11. \n   \nThe Parking Transaction under Rev. Proc. 2000-37. \n \nRev. Proc. 2000-37 sets forth a safe harbor for acquiring replacement property \nunder a qualified exchange accommodation arrangement (\u201cQEAA\u201d), sometimes referred \nto as a \"parking\" transaction, to facilitate reverse like-kind exchanges.  As provided in \nthis safe harbor, the Service will not challenge either (1) the qualification of property as \neither replacement or relinquished property (as defined in \u00a7 1.1031(k)-1(a)), or (2) the \ntreatment of the EAT as the beneficial owner of such property for Federal income tax \npurposes, if the property is held in a QEAA as defined in section 4.02 of Rev. Proc. \n2000-37.   \n \nAPPLICATION AND ANALYSIS \n \nTaxpayer represents that the exchange satisfies the requirements for deferred \nexchanges set forth in \u00a7 1.1031(k)-1 and the safe harbor for reverse exchanges set \nforth in Rev. Proc. 2000-37.  Accordingly, the only issue in this case is whether non-\nrecognition treatment under \u00a7 1031 would apply to a transaction where (1) Taxpayer \npurchases like-kind Replacement Property from an unrelated third party via EAT, (2) \nTaxpayer sells Relinquished Property to Related Party for cash consideration received \nby a QI, and (3) Related Party disposes Relinquished Property within two years of the \nacquisition. \n \n \nPLR-126651-06 \n \n \n \n6 \nRelated Party\u2019s disposal of Relinquished Property within two years of the \nacquisition will not trigger taxable gains pursuant to \u00a7 1031(f)(1).  In the instant case, \nTaxpayer and Related Party did not engage in a like-kind exchange.  Taxpayer \ntransferred Relinquished Property to Related Party through a QI, who also purchased \nReplacement Property from an unrelated third person for Taxpayer.  Taxpayer\u2019s transfer \nof Relinquished Property to the QI and subsequent receipt of like-kind Replacement \nProperty from the QI is treated as an exchange with the QI, who is not related to \nTaxpayer.  Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.1031(k)-1(g)(4).   \n \nIn addition, \u00a7 1031(f)(4) will not apply to prevent nonrecognition of the gain or \nloss in the exchange.  Taxpayer did not transfer Relinquished Property to Related Party \nas part of a transaction or series of transactions, structured to avoid the purposes of      \n\u00a7 1031(f)(1).  The related parties in this case did not exchange high basis property for \nlow basis property in anticipation of the sale of the low basis property.  Only Taxpayer \nheld property before the reverse like-kind exchange and continued to hold like-kind \nproperty after the exchange.  Related Party did not hold property before the exchange.  \nAccordingly, Related Party\u2019s proposed disposal of Relinquished Property within two \nyears of the acquisition will not result in a \u201ccashing out\u201d of an investment or shifting of \nbasis between Taxpayer and Related Party.   \n \nRULING \n \n \nUnder the given facts and representations, \u00a7 1031(f) will not apply to trigger \nrecognition of any gain realized when (1) Taxpayer purchases like-kind Replacement \nProperty from an unrelated third party via EAT, (2) Taxpayer sells Relinquished \nProperty to Related Party for cash consideration received by a QI, and (3) Related Party \ndisposes Relinquished Property within two years of the acquisition. \n  \nDISCLAIMERS \n \n \nExcept as provided above, no opinion is expressed as to the Federal tax \ntreatment of the transaction under any other provisions of the Internal Revenue Code \nand the Income Tax Regulations that may be applicable or under any other general \nprinciples of Federal income taxation.  Neither is any opinion expressed as to the tax \ntreatment of any conditions existing at the time of, nor effects resulting from, the \ntransaction that are not specifically covered by the above ruling.   \n \nThis ruling assumes that (1) E Corp. is eligible to serve as EAT within the \nmeaning of Rev. Proc. 2000-37, (2) F Corp. is eligible to serve as QI in this transaction \nwithin the meaning of \u00a7 1.1031(k)-1(g)(4), (3) Taxpayer and Related Party are related \npersons within the meaning of \u00a7 1031(f)(3), and (4) the transaction satisfies the \nrequirements for deferred exchanges set forth in \u00a7 1.1031(k)-1 and the safe harbor for \nreverse exchanges set forth in Rev. Proc. 2000-37.  While this office has not verified \n \nPLR-126651-06 \n \n \n \n7 \nany of the material submitted in support of the request for ruling, it is subject to \nverification on examination.  No opinion is expressed as to whether the accommodators \nused in this transaction are disqualified persons as defined in \u00a7 1.1031(k)-1(k), as that \nwould constitute essentially a factual determination.   \n \n \nThis ruling is directed only to Taxpayer.  Section 6110 (k)(3) provides that it may \nnot be cited as precedent.  Pursuant to the Power of Attorney submitted by Taxpayer, a \ncopy of this letter will be sent to Taxpayer\u2019s authorized representatives. \n \n                                                  \n \n \nSincerely, \n \n \n______________________________ \nWilliam A.

In your letter, you requested that \nthe IRS rule that the right to buy power from Power Company, held on the date of sale \nby Parent\u2019s wholly-owned subsidiary, Taxpayer, is a capital asset under section 1221 of \nthe Internal Revenue Code in the hands of Taxpayer, and that any gain from the \nassignment of such right to Buyer qualifies as capital gain.  \nFACTS\nPLR-116216-11\n3\nParent, a corporation, is the common parent of an affiliated group of corporations that \nfile a consolidated return for federal tax purposes.  It is engaged in the business of \nelectric power generation and distribution.  Power Company, a corporation, is the owner \nand operator of the Power Plant, under a license from the Federal Energy Regulatory \nCommission (\u201cFERC\u201d).\nPower Company\u2019s original FERC license for the Power Plant was issued on Original \nLicense Commencement Date for a ----year term that expired on Original License \nExpiration Date.  Power Company applied for renewal of the FERC license for the \nPower Plant.  Between Original License Expiration Date and New License \nCommencement Date, Power Company operated the Power Plant under an annual \nFERC license.  On New License Issuance Date, FERC issued a new license to Power \nCompany for the Power Plant effective New License Commencement Date and expiring \non New License Expiration Date. \nPower Company was incorporated on Power Company Incorporation Date, with two \nstockholders:  Local Power Company, which owned -------------of the total authorized \nstock of Power Company, and Partner, which owned --------------of the total authorized \nstock of Power Company.  On Original PPA Date, Local Power Company merged into \nSub A, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent.  As a result, Sub A acquired Local Power \nCompany\u2019s stock interest in Power Company.  After this merger, Partner retained its ----\n--------------stock interest in Power Company and Sub A owned -------------of the total \nauthorized stock of Power Company.\nAlso on the Original PPA Date, Sub A, Partner, and Power Company entered into a \npower purchase agreement (the \u201cOriginal PPA\u201d).  Pursuant to the Original PPA, Sub A \nand Partner are entitled to purchase all the capacity and energy available from the \nPower Plant.  The Original PPA entitled Sub A and Partner to purchase -------------and --\n-------------, respectively, of the total capacity and energy available from the Power Plant.\nOn the New PPA Date, Sub A, Partner, and Power Company entered into a power \npurchase agreement effective on the New PPA Effective Date (the \u201cNew PPA\u201d), which \nsuperseded and replaced the Original PPA.  Pursuant to the New PPA, Sub A and \nPartner are entitled to purchase all the capacity and energy available from the Power \nPlant.  The New PPA entitled Sub A and Partner to purchase -------------and -------------, \nrespectively, of the total capacity and daily energy available from the Power Plant. \nThe New PPA provides that it shall remain in force until the expiration of Power \nCompany\u2019s FERC license for the Power Plant on the New PPA Expiration Date and \u201cfor \nsuch time thereafter as [Power Company] is the licensee from the Federal Energy \nRegulatory Commission of the [Power Plant].\u201d  \nSub A paid no consideration to Power Company for the right to purchase capacity and \nenergy from the Power Plant under the Original PPA and the New PPA.  \nPLR-116216-11\n4\nEffective on the Reorganization Date, Parent underwent a divisive reorganization (i.e., a \ndrop down of assets followed by a spinoff of Parent\u2019s generation assets) under \u00a7 \n368(a)(1)(D) of the Internal Revenue Code.  The transaction was tax free to Parent \nunder \u00a7 355, tax free to Sub A under \u00a7 361, and tax free to Sub B, a direct and wholly-\nowned subsidiary of Sub A, under \u00a7 1032.  \nAs part of this divisive reorganization, Sub A transferred its stock interest in Power \nCompany, and assigned its rights and obligations under the New PPA, to Sub B.  Sub B \ntook a carryover basis of zero in the New PPA.  Parent then caused Sub B to transfer \nthe stock interest in Power Company and assign the rights and obligations under the \nNew PPA down a chain of entities that are disregarded as separate from their owners \nunder \u00a7 301.7701-2(c)(2)(i) of the Income Tax Regulations to Taxpayer.  Taxpayer took \na carryover basis of zero in the New PPA from Sub B.  Taxpayer did not pay any \nconsideration for the assignment of the New PPA.\nTaxpayer, a limited liability company, is wholly owned by Sub B and is a disregarded \nentity for federal income tax purposes.  Taxpayer was formed on Taxpayer Formation \nDate in anticipation of Parent\u2019s divisive reorganization in order to receive Parent\u2019s --------\n------------------------------------------business.  Taxpayer is an exempt wholesale generator \nauthorized to sell electric energy, capacity, and certain ancillary services at market-\nbased rates.\nParent represents that the rights and obligations of Sub A under the New PPA were \ntransferred to Sub B in a transaction described in \u00a7 197(f)(2)(B) and \u00a7 1.197-\n2(g)(2)(ii)(C).\n   \nTaxpayer entered into a purchase and sale agreement dated Sale Agreement Execution \nDate, effective as of the agreement\u2019s closing date on Sale Agreement Effective Date, in \nwhich Taxpayer sold its entire stock interest in Power Company to Buyer.  As part of the \npurchase and sale agreement, Taxpayer also entered into an assignment and \nassumption agreement in which Taxpayer assigned its rights and obligations under the \nNew PPA to Buyer.  The total consideration Buyer paid to Taxpayer for the sale of its \nPower Company stock and the assignment of its rights and obligations under the New \nPPA was $A.  The purchase and sale agreement does not allocate this amount between \nthe sale of the Power Company stock and the assignment of the New PPA.  However, \nParent has obtained a valuation concluding that X% of the $A (or $B) is allocable to the \nassignment of Taxpayer\u2019s rights and obligations under the New PPA.  Because \nTaxpayer\u2019s basis in the power purchase right is zero, Taxpayer will recognize a gain on \nthe assignment of its rights and obligations under the New PPA of $B.\nParent represents that:  (i) FERC licenses generally are always renewed; (ii) according \nto its outside FERC counsel, as long as a FERC licensee has a good compliance record \nas a licensee, then it is virtually certain that the licensee can relicense its facility, albeit \nwith more onerous environmental conditions, so long as the licensee complies with the \nPLR-116216-11\n5\nnotice and application deadlines of the Federal Power Act (\u201cFPA\u201d); (iii) absent the rare \ninstance of a government takeover or abandonment of a power project, FERC licenses \nalmost always continue through the renewal process; and (iv) Power Company has a \ngood compliance record as a licensee.  Parent states that to the best of its knowledge, it \nbelieves that Power Company fully intends to renew its current FERC license for the \nPower Plant, which expires on the New License Expiration Date.   \nLAW AND ANALYSIS\nSection 1222 provides that capital gain or loss is generated upon a sale or exchange of \na capital asset.\nSection 1221 defines the term \"capital asset\" as property held by the taxpayer, \nregardless of whether it is connected with the taxpayer's trade or business, unless the \nproperty meets one of eight listed exceptions: (1) inventory; (2) property of a character \nwhich is subject to the allowance for depreciation provided in section 167, or real \nproperty used in a trade or business; (3) certain intangible property; (4) accounts \nreceivable acquired in the ordinary course of a trade or business; (5) certain \npublications of the United States Government; (6) certain commodities financial \nderivatives; (7) certain hedging transactions; and (8) supplies of a type regularly \nconsumed by the taxpayer in the ordinary course of a trade or business of the taxpayer.\nNone of the exceptions listed in \u00a7 1221 to qualification as a capital asset apply, with the \npossible exception of \u00a7 1221(a)(2), property of a character which is subject to the \nallowance for depreciation provided in \u00a7 167.  \nIs the New PPA property of a character that is subject to the allowance for depreciation \nprovided under \u00a7 167?\nThe first issue is whether Taxpayer\u2019s right to purchase capacity and energy under the \nNew PPA is property of a character that is subject to the allowance for depreciation \nprovided under \u00a7 167.\nSection 167(a) allows as a depreciation deduction a reasonable allowance for the \nexhaustion, wear and tear, and obsolescence of property used in a trade or business or \nof property held for the production of income.\nSection 1.167(a)-3(a) provides that if an intangible asset is known from experience or \nother factors to be of use in the business or in the production of income for only a \nlimited period, the length of which can be estimated with reasonable accuracy, such an \nintangible asset may be the subject of a depreciation allowance.  However, an \nintangible asset, the useful life of which is not limited, is not subject to an allowance for \ndepreciation.  Thus, an intangible asset is depreciable under \u00a7 167(a) if it has a \ndeterminable useful life.\nPLR-116216-11\n6\nThe New PPA provides that it shall remain in force until the expiration of Power \nCompany\u2019s FERC license for the Power Plant on New License Expiration Date and \u201cfor \nsuch time thereafter as [Power Company] is the licensee from the Federal Energy \nRegulatory Commission of the [Power Plant].\u201d  Consequently, the New PPA has a life \nthat is coterminous with Power Company\u2019s FERC license for the Power Plant.  \nFurther, Parent represents that, according to its outside FERC counsel, as long as a \nFERC licensee has a good compliance record as a licensee, then it is virtually certain \nthat the licensee can relicense its facility, albeit with more onerous environmental \nconditions, so long as the licensee complies with the notice and application deadlines of \nthe FPA.  Parent also represents that Power Company has a good compliance record \nas a licensee. \nTo renew a FERC license for a hydroelectric plant, the existing licensee must notify \nFERC whether the licensee intends to file an application for a new license or not.  16 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 808(b)(1).  This notice must be submitted at least 5 years before the expiration \nof the existing license.  Id.  Further, the existing licensee must file the application for a \nnew license with FERC at least 24 months before the expiration of the term of the \nexisting license.  16 U.S.C. \u00a7 808(c)(1).  \nPower Company applied for a renewal of its original FERC license for the Power Plant, \nwhich expired on Original License Expiration Date, and as a result, FERC issued a new \nlicense to Power Company for Power Plant for a ----year term expiring on New License \nExpiration Date.  Parent states that to the best of its knowledge, Parent believes that \nPower Company fully intends to renew its current license for the Power Plant.\n   \nSeveral courts have held that an FCC broadcasting license does not have a limited \nuseful life for depreciation purposes because there is a high probability of renewal of the \nlicense by the FCC.  See Forward Communications Corp. v. United States, 608 F.2d \n485 (1979) (amortization disallowed for FCC broadcasting license due to high \nprobability of an indefinite succession of automatic renewals); see also Times-World \nCorporation v. United States, 251 F.Supp. 43 (W.D. Va. 1966).  The same reasoning \nwas used in Nachman v. Commissioner, 191 F.2d 934, 936 (5th Cir. 1951) (denied \ndepreciation deduction for the cost of a liquor license because there was \u201cno indication \nthat the City would depart from its custom of renewing existing licenses\u201d) and in Ueckler \nv. Commission, 81 T.C. 983, 993-995 (1983) (denied depreciation deduction for the cost \nof a federal grazing privilege license with preferential rights of renewal).  \nA FERC license for a hydroelectric plant is analogous to an FCC broadcasting license \nand other renewable licenses issued by governmental agencies that have a high \ncertainty of renewal.  Consequently, a FERC license for a hydroelectric plant has an \nindeterminable useful life for depreciation purposes.  Because the New PPA has a life \nPLR-116216-11\n7\nthat is coterminous with Power Company\u2019s FERC license for the Power Plant, the New \nPPA also has an indeterminable useful life for depreciation purposes.\nIs the New PPA an Amortizable Section 197 intangible?\nEven though we have concluded that the New PPA has an indeterminable useful life for \ndepreciation purposes, a second issue is whether the New PPA is property of a \ncharacter subject to depreciation under \u00a7 167 if it is an amortizable section 197 \nintangible.\nSection 197(f)(7) provides that for purposes of Chapter 1 of the Code, any amortizable \nsection 197 intangible shall be treated as property which is of a character subject to the \nallowance for depreciation provided in \u00a7 167.\nSection 197(c)(1) defines the term \u201camortizable section 197 intangible\u201d as generally \nmeaning any section 197 intangible that is acquired by the taxpayer after August 10, \n1993, and that is held in connection with the conduct of a trade or business or an \nactivity described in \u00a7 212.\nHowever, \u00a7 197(c)(2) provides that the term \u201camortizable section 197 intangible\u201d shall \nnot include any section 197 intangible that is not described in \u00a7 197(d)(1)(D), (E), or (F), \nand that is created by the taxpayer.\nSection 197(f)(2)(A) provides that in the case of any section 197 intangible transferred \nin a transaction described in \u00a7 197(f)(2)(B), the transferee shall be treated as the \ntransferor for purposes of applying \u00a7 197 with respect to so much of the adjusted basis \nin the hands of the transferee as does not exceed the adjusted basis in the hands of the \ntransferor.  The transactions described in \u00a7 197(f)(2)(B) are (i) any transaction \ndescribed in \u00a7 332, 351, 361, 721, 731, 1031, or 1033, and (ii) any transaction between\nmembers of the same affiliated group during any taxable year for which a consolidated \nreturn is made by such group.\nSection 1.197-2(g)(2) provides the rules relating to \u00a7 197(f)(2)(A) and (B).  Section \n1.197-2(g)(2)(ii)(A) provides that if a section 197 intangible is transferred in a \ntransaction described in \u00a7 1.197-2(g)(2)(ii)(C), the transfer is disregarded in determining \n(1) whether, with respect to so much of the intangible\u2019s basis in the hands of the \ntransferee as does not exceed its basis in the hands of the transferor, the intangible is \nan amortizable section 197 intangible, and (2) the amount of the deduction under \u00a7 197 \nwith respect to such basis.\nSection 1.197-2(g)(2)(ii)(B) provides, in relevant part, that if the intangible was not an \namortizable section 197 intangible in the hands of the transferor, the transferee\u2019s \nadjusted basis, to the extent it does not exceed the transferor\u2019s adjusted basis, cannot \nbe amortized under \u00a7 197.  Section 1.197-2(g)(2)(ii)(B) further provides that the rules of \nPLR-116216-11\n8\n\u00a7 1.197-2(g)(2)(ii) also apply to any subsequent transfers of the intangible in a \ntransaction described in \u00a7 1.197-2(g)(2)(ii)(C).\nSection 1.197-2(g)(2)(ii)(C) provides that the transactions described in this paragraph \nare: (1) any transaction described in \u00a7 332, 351, 361, 721, or 731; and (2) any \ntransaction between corporations that are members of the same consolidated group \nimmediately after the transaction.    \nIn this case, Sub A originally acquired the right to purchase -------------of the capacity \nand energy from the Power Plant under the Original PPA on Original PPA Date.  The \nNew PPA superseded the Original PPA.  Under the New PPA, Sub A continued to have \nthe right to purchase -------------of the capacity and energy from the Power Plant.  \nBecause Sub A acquired the right to purchase -------------of the capacity and energy \nfrom the Power Plant prior to August 10, 1993, the right is not an amortizable section \n197 intangible in the hands of Sub A.\nOn Reorganization Date, the rights and obligations of Sub A under the New PPA were \ntransferred to Sub B in a transaction described in \u00a7 197(f)(2)(B) and \u00a7 1.197-\n2(g)(2)(ii)(C).  Sub B then transferred the rights and obligations under the New PPA to \nTaxpayer, a limited liability company that is wholly owned by Sub B and is disregarded \nas an entity separate from Sub B for federal income tax purposes.  Sub B and Taxpayer \ndid not pay any consideration for this power purchase right.  Accordingly, pursuant to \u00a7 \n1.197-2(g)(2)(ii)(B), the right to purchase -------------of the capacity and energy from the \nPower Plant under the New PPA is not an amortizable section 197 intangible in the \nhands of Sub B and Taxpayer.  Thus, we conclude that Taxpayer\u2019s right to purchase \ncapacity and energy under the New PPA is not property of a character that is subject to \nthe allowance for depreciation provided under \u00a7 167, and thus the New PPA is a capital \nasset.\nWas the assignment of the New PPA a sale or exchange under \u00a71222?\nFinally, to qualify for capital gain treatment, there must be a \u201csale or exchange\u201d of \nproperty amounting to a capital asset. \u00a7 1222.  A \u201csale\u201d has been defined as a \u201ctransfer \nof property for a fixed price in money or its equivalent.\u201d  Commissioner of Internal \nRevenue v. Brown, 380 U.S. 563, 571 (1965).  The Tax Court has held that the terms \n\u201csale or exchange\u201c in \u00a7 1222 include \u201ctransactions in which all rights to property or all \nrights to a portion thereof have been transferred permanently from one party to \nanother\u201d, including assignment of rights under a contract. Foy v. Commissioner, 84 \nT.C. 50, 73 (1985).  Taxpayer entered into a purchase and sale agreement on Sale \nAgreement Execution Date in which Taxpayer sold its entire stock interest in Power \nCompany to Buyer.  On the same date, Taxpayer also entered into an assignment and \nassumption agreement in which Taxpayer assigned its rights and obligations under the \nNew PPA to Buyer.  Total consideration for the two transactions was $A, and Parent \nhas obtained a valuation concluding that $B of the total is allocable to the assignment of \nPLR-116216-11\n9\nTaxpayer\u2019s rights and obligations under the New PPA.  Parent represents that the \nassignment and assumption agreement constitutes a \u201csale or exchange\" under \u00a7 1222 \nand that an assignment and assumption agreement is commonly used in its industry to \nsell a contract right. Under the rule of Foy, the assignment of the New PPA for \nconsideration is a \u201csale or exchange\" under \u00a7 1222 because all rights under the New \nPPA, a capital asset, were transferred to Buyer.   \nCONCLUSION\nWe conclude that the New PPA is a capital asset in the hands of Taxpayer for purposes \nof \u00a7 1221 and that any gain from the assignment of such right to Buyer qualifies for \ncapital gain treatment. \nExcept as expressly provided herein, no opinion is expressed or implied concerning the \nfederal income tax consequences of any aspect of any transaction or item discussed or \nreferenced in this ruling.\nThis ruling is directed only to the taxpayer requesting it.  Section 6110(k)(3) provides \nthat it may not be used or cited as precedent.\nIn accordance with the Power of Attorney on file with this office, a copy of this letter is \nbeing sent to your authorized representative.\nA copy of this letter must be attached to any income tax return to which it is relevant. \nAlternatively, taxpayers filing their returns electronically may satisfy this requirement by \nattaching a statement to their return that provides the date and control number of the \nletter ruling.\nThe rulings contained in this letter are based upon information and representations\nsubmitted by the taxpayer and accompanied by a penalty of perjury statement executed \nby an appropriate party.

Taxpayer manufactures three different types of \n\u201cwalking floor\u201d or \u201clive floor\u201d trailers (herein, \u201clive floor\u201d).  Each type of live-floor trailer is \ndesigned and built for a specific use.  At issue in this case is Taxpayer\u2019s Trailer Model \nA.     \n \nTrailer Model A is specifically designed and built by Taxpayer to haul and unload \nvarious agricultural commodities that are used as livestock feed and fertilizer to and on \nfarms and feed lots.  The trailer is an open-top, rectangular box.   \n \nTaxpayer has recently redesigned Trailer Model A, replacing many of its high tensile \nsteel components with extruded aluminum components (EACs).  The purpose of the \ndesign change was to reduce the trailer\u2019s weight so as to increase its hauling capacity, \nthereby making it better suited to end users desiring to haul agricultural commodities for \nuse as livestock feed and fertilizer.  Although some strength and durability was \n \nPLR-144722-07 \n \n \n2 \nsacrificed in the redesign, the strength and durability that was lost was not needed to \nhaul and unload agricultural commodities used as livestock feed and fertilizer because \nTrailer Model A is not unloaded on a tip dumper (discussed below).  Taxpayer \nrepresents that Trailer Model A is not strong and durable enough to be unloaded on a \ntip dumper.  Taxpayer represents that farms, dairies, and feed lots generally do not \nhave tip dumpers. \n \nTaxpayer represents that even with the increased hauling capacity gained by using \nEAC\u2019s, Trailer Model A is not efficient for use in hauling on the highways because it \ncosts about twice as much as a general purpose freight trailer and has only about three-\nfourths of the legal load-carrying capacity of a comparably-sized conventional general \npurpose freight trailer. \n \nAccording to Taxpayer, other features also indicate that Trailer Model A was primarily \ndesigned for use on a farm.  For example, it is loaded from the top and unloaded \nthrough doors at the rear, using live floor technology.  The unloading process takes \nabout 15 minutes.  Trailer Model A has heavy-duty EAC rails at the top of the trailer that \nslope inward to self-clean, which prevents fertilizer from contaminating feed.  Trailer \nModel A\u2019s lower rails support the live floor, are designed to prevent the sidewalls from \nbuckling under stress, and are critical in limiting corrosion and contamination of the \ncargo.  The front coupler, landing gear, live floor mechanism, and rear suspension \nsubframe are fastened to the lower rails to enhance the rigidity of the trailer. \n \nTaxpayer further represents that Trailer Model A is not suitable for hauling a commodity \nfor human consumption, such as corn, because during harvest, all farmers in the area \ndeliver to a common processing plant within a compressed period of time.  Processing \nplants have tip loaders to accommodate quick delivery.  As noted above, Trailer Model \nA is not suitable for tip loading.  In the alternative, if the owner of Trailer Model A \nprocesses its own commodity and/or hauls it on the highway directly to the consumer, \nthe owner needs a refrigerated truck and/or a truck capable of being unloaded by \nforklift.  Trailer Model A is neither. \n \nIn contrast with Trailer Model A, Trailer Model B is designed for forest products.  Trailer \nModel B is designed to withstand the extraordinary stress placed on the frame from \nunloading with a tip dumper, loading with a hopper, or driving on rutted, uneven or \nunpaved ground, causing great torsional stress.  A tip dumper elevates the front of a \ntrailer up to 67 degrees in the air and unloads a truck in two or three minutes.  A hopper \ndrops wood chips into the trailer, and can occasion great stress if the chips become \n\u201chung up\u201d and all fall at once.  Because of design features intended to be used in these \ncircumstances, Trailer Model B is heavier and costs more than Trailer Model A.   \n \nTrailer Model C, which is designed for hauling refuse and other waste material, is \nconstructed of heavier and more durable material than either Trailer Model A or Trailer \n \nPLR-144722-07 \n \n \n3 \nModel B.  Trailer Model C\u2019s deck is sometimes fabricated from water-resistant materials.  \nTrailer Model C is also more expensive than Taxpayer\u2019s other live floor trailers. \n \nSection 4051(a)(1) imposes a tax on the first retail sale of, among other things, \nautomobile truck bodies and truck trailer and semitrailer bodies. \n \nSection 4053(2) provides that the tax imposed by section 4051 shall not be imposed on \nany body primarily designed- (A) to process or prepare seed, feed, or fertilizer for use \non farms, (B) to haul feed, seed, or fertilizer on farms, (C) to spread feed, seed, or \nfertilizer on farms, (D) to load or unload feed, seed, or fertilizer on farms, or (E) for any \ncombination of the foregoing. \n \nRev. Rul. 69-579, 1969-2 C.B. 200, holds that certain automotive truck bodies equipped \nwith heavy-duty unloading equipment and used primarily for hauling feed, seed, and \nfertilizer to and on farms, are exempt from the manufacturers tax under section \n4063(a)(2)(B) (the predecessor to the section 4053(2) exemption provided for retailers \ntax purposes). \n \nRev. Rul. 69-579 describes truck, trailer, and semitrailer bodies that contain heavy-duty \nmechanical or pneumatic type unloading equipment specially designed to facilitate \nunloading on the farm.  The unloading equipment is built into, and forms an integral part \nof the bodies, adding substantially to their cost and weight, and limiting their load-\ncarrying capacity.  The mechanical system uses conveyors and augers, and unloads \nfrom the top of the body; the pneumatic system uses a blower and hose, and usually \nunloads from the bottom and rear of the body.  Each system is activated by a power \ntake-off from the truck engine.  The bodies are usually divided into separate \ncompartments and are either open at the top or completely enclosed. \n \nThe revenue ruling states that the elaborate and expensive unloading systems built into \nthese bodies, and the modifications of the bodies required to accommodate the \nunloading systems, make it impracticable to purchase the bodies for use other than in \nhauling feed, seed, or fertilizer to, and unloading it on, farms.  The revenue ruling \nconcludes that the bodies are primarily designed to haul and unload feed, seed, or \nfertilizer on farms, and are exempt from the manufacturers tax by virtue of the section \n4063(a)(2)(B) exemption. \n \nRev. Rul. 75-462, 1975-2 C.B. 419, provides that highway bodies that are used for the \ngeneral hauling of feed, seed, or fertilizer over the highway are subject to the \nmanufacturers excise tax unless they have specific features that indicate they are \nprimarily designed to haul feed, seed, or fertilizer to and on farms.   \n \nRev. Rul. 2004-80, 2004-2 C.B. 164, addresses the definition of the term \u201cprimarily \ndesigned\u201d as that term is used in distinguishing a truck from a tractor for purposes of \n \nPLR-144722-07 \n \n \n4 \nsection 4051(a)(1).  The revenue ruling states that the term \u201cprimarily designed\u201d means \nprincipally designed.  It does not mean exclusively designed. \n \nThe exemption from tax provided by section 4053(2) does not extend to bodies primarily \ndesigned for general use, even though the bodies may be capable of hauling feed, \nseed, and fertilizer to and on farms or performing other functions described in section \n4053(2).  To be exempt, a body must be primarily designed for one, or a combination of \nfunctions described in section 4053(2).   \n \nIn requesting tax-exempt treatment for Trailer Model A, Taxpayer submitted a letter \nruling request that was detailed and comprehensive.  To complement the extensive \nfactual discussion, the letter ruling request included engineering schematics, full-color \nbrochures, and a matrix comparing and contrasting the different types of live floor \ntrailers produced by Taxpayer, as well as a comprehensive legal analysis.   \n \nWith regard to the Trailer Model A truck and semitrailer bodies at issue in this case, \neach of the bodies contains an unloading system that is built into, and forms an integral \npart of, the body.  The special unloading equipment is elaborate and expensive, adds \nsubstantially to the cost and weight of each body, and limits its load-carrying \ncapabilities.  Thus, like the specially designed bodies described in Rev. Rul. 69-579, \npurchase of the subject bodies for use other than in hauling feed, seed, or fertilizer to, \nand unloading it on, farms, would be impractical.   \n \nFurther, the detailed information provided by Taxpayer highlights a number of specific \nfeatures, including the unloading system, the use of EACs (which reduces the strength \nand durability of the trailers), the sloped design and self-cleaning nature of the rails at \nthe top of the trailer, and the fabrication of the lower rails to limit corrosion and \ncontamination of the trailer\u2019s cargo, that indicate Trailer Model A is primarily designed \nfor use on farms. \n \nAccordingly, the truck and semitrailer bodies described herein as Trailer Model A fall \nwithin the exemption provided by section 4053(2) and Taxpayer's retail sales thereof are \nexempt from the tax imposed by section 4051(a)(1). \n \nThis ruling is directed only to the taxpayer requesting it.

For the reasons set forth below, we conclude that\nthey are not.\nFacts\nTaxpayer is a board composed of members appointed by the governor and\nconfirmed by the senate of State.  Taxpayer controls, operates, and manages certain\nstate educational institutions.  Taxpayer appoints the chief executive officers of the\neducational institutions, who serve at Taxpayer\u2019s pleasure and receive such\ncompensation as Taxpayer prescribes.  The chief executive officer of each educational\ninstitution (designated as either the chancellor or president) appoints such employees\nas are authorized by Taxpayer.\nPLR-121014-01\n-2-\n1   Benefits eligible employees may begin making voluntary tax-deferred\ncontributions immediately upon employment.  These voluntary contributions may also\nbe used to supplement the mandatory retirement plan.\nThe civil service of State is divided into the unclassified and the classified\nservices.  The unclassified service includes certain positions held by state officers or\nemployees, including the chancellor, president, deans, administrative officers, student\nhealth service physicians, pharmacists, teaching and research personnel, health care\nemployees, and student employees of the educational institutions under Taxpayer\u2019s\ncontrol.  Unclassified employees of the educational institutions receive such\ncompensation as is prescribed by the chief executive officer, subject to policies\napproved by Taxpayer.  Employees of the educational institutions who are not in the\nunclassified service are in the classified service of the State civil service act.\nSalaries and wages for unclassified employees are required by State statute to\nbe fixed on an annual basis prior to the beginning of each fiscal year.  Accordingly,\nTaxpayer enters into a contract of appointment with each unclassified employee on an\nannual basis.  The contract of appointment specifically identifies the position offered,\nthe term of appointment (generally either nine or twelve months), and the base salary\npaid to each unclassified employee.\nPursuant to State statute Taxpayer is required to assist all persons who are\nemployed by Taxpayer or by educational institutions under its management and who\nare in the unclassified service under the State civil service act in the purchase of\nretirement annuities.  Specifically, all unclassified employees employed half-time or\nmore must begin participating in and contributing to the Plan on the first day of the pay\nperiod coinciding with or next following the completion of one year of service.  Failure of\nan eligible employee to participate is cause for immediate termination.  Contributions\nunder the Plan are applied to the development of individual employee account balances\nand to the purchase of annuity contracts from one of four life insurance companies\nauthorized by Taxpayer to participate in the Plan.\nState statute requires all eligible employees to contribute an amount toward the\npurchase of retirement annuities equal to X% of their salaries, \u201csuch contributions to be\nmade through payroll deductions and on a pretax basis.\u201d1  The employee\u2019s base salary\nas set forth in the appointment contract is reduced by X% to fund the employee\u2019s\nretirement plan contribution.  State statute also requires that Taxpayer contribute an\namount toward the purchase of such retirement annuities equal to Y% of the\nemployees\u2019 base salaries.  Thus, as a participant in the Plan, the employee contributes\na percentage of his base salary and Taxpayer contributes an amount equal to a\npercentage of the employee\u2019s base salary.  These amounts are remitted to the\nemployee\u2019s selected investment provider each pay period.\nAll contributions vest immediately and the current value of the contributions is\npayable to beneficiaries if the employee dies before retirement.  Thus, the employee\u2019s\nretirement account is 100% vested and nonforfeitable.  However, distributions from the\nPlan may only be made upon retirement, separation from service, disability, death, or\nthe demonstration of financial hardship.  In the event a participant in the Plan\nterminates employment for reasons other than retirement or disability and requests the\nPLR-121014-01\n-3-\ndistribution of his or her accounts, the employing institution must first certify that the\nemployee has terminated employment.\nState statute provides that the employees\u2019 required contributions are to be made\n\u201con a pretax basis.\u201d  The Plan does not, however, specifically require that eligible\nemployees execute a salary reduction agreement.  Taxpayer\u2019s retirement resolution\n(describing the provisions of the Plan as authorized by law and established by\nTaxpayer) provides that Plan contributions by a participant will be made on a\ntax-deferred basis under an agreement for salary reduction executed in accordance\nwith section 403(b).  In relevant part, the prescribed salary reduction agreement\nauthorizes and directs Taxpayer to reduce the eligible employee\u2019s compensation to\npurchase a non-forfeitable annuity.  Specifically, Taxpayer is authorized to reduce the\nemployee\u2019s base compensation under the required matching retirement plan by X%\napplicable each pay period and to pay an additional amount of Y% to provide retirement\nbenefits as described under the applicable statute.  Finally, Taxpayer is directed to\napply said sums to the payment of deposits for a retirement annuity contract selected\nby the employee in accordance with the terms of the required matching retirement\nprogram.\nThe salary reduction agreement provides that it is legally binding and irrevocable\nwhile employment continues and that it will remain in force for the duration of\nemployment.  The salary reduction agreement is signed and dated by the employee\nand by the Division of Human Resources on behalf of Taxpayer.  Until an eligible\nemployee signs a salary reduction agreement form and is enrolled in a basic retirement\nplan, the employee\u2019s X% contribution is held in a non-interest bearing clearing fund. \nNeither the employee\u2019s nor the Taxpayer\u2019s contributions are credited with interest while\nin this clearing fund nor is interest credited retroactively.\nLegal Analysis\nTaxpayer requests a ruling that compulsory contributions made pursuant to the\nPlan and used to purchase retirement annuity contracts described in section 403(b) are\nexcludible from wages for FICA tax purposes.  Code sections 3101 and 3111 impose\nFICA taxes on employees and employers, respectively, equal to a percentage of the\nwages received by an individual with respect to employment.  Code section 3121(a)\ndefines wages for FICA tax purposes as all remuneration for employment unless\nspecifically excepted.  Code section 3121(a)(5)(D) provides that wages do not include\nany payment made to, or on behalf of, an employee or his beneficiary under or to an\nannuity contract described in section 403(b), other than a payment for the purchase of\nsuch contract which is made by reason of a salary reduction agreement.  Employee\ncontributions (i.e., after-tax contributions) made through salary deductions and used to\npurchase annuity contracts are includible in wages for FICA tax purposes.\nCode section 403(b)(1) provides that amounts contributed by certain employers\nfor the purchase of an annuity contract for an employee are excludible from the gross\nincome of the employee if certain requirements are satisfied.  While annuity contracts\ndescribed in section 403(b) are generally purchased with amounts contributed by an\nemployer, the employer\u2019s contributions are not required to be \u201cmerely a supplement to\npast or current compensation.\u201d  Treas. Reg. \u00a71.403(b)-1(b)(3).  Thus, the exclusion is\napplicable to amounts contributed by an employer for an annuity contract as a result of\nPLR-121014-01\n-4-\nan agreement with an employee to take a reduction in salary.  As with wages for FICA\ntax purposes, employee contributions made through salary deductions and used to\npurchase annuity contracts are includible in the employee\u2019s gross income.\nTo determine whether compulsory contributions made pursuant to the Plan and\nused to purchase retirement annuity contracts are excludible from wages for FICA tax\npurposes, we must first determine whether such compulsory contributions constitute\nemployer contributions for purposes of section 403(b) and section 3121(a)(5)(D).  In\nRevenue Ruling 56-473, 1956-2 C.B. 22, the Service considered the treatment for\nFederal income tax purposes of amounts deducted from the salaries of public\nemployees of the State of Arizona and credited to their retirement accounts pursuant to\nthe state\u2019s retirement system.  The pertinent provisions of the retirement system act\nprovided for open-end annuities, conditional upon retirement, and a pension based on\nprior service.  The benefits were not measured by salaries or length of service but,\nrather, were dependent entirely upon the amount credited to the individual upon\nretirement.  The account was made up of public funds equal to seven percent of the\ngross authorized salary for all public employment while a member of the retirement\nsystem.  The seven percent credit was specified as a three and one-half percent\ncontribution of the authorized salary by the member and the contribution of an equal\npercent by the state.\nUnder the act, the phrase \u201cauthorized salary\u201d was used to emphasize the\ndistinction between the gross pay and the amount remaining to the employee after\ncrediting and deducting the three and one-half percent contribution.  The contributions\nby the members were held by a retirement board and became available to the\nemployee only when the employee terminated his employment with the state and\nwithdrew his contributions.  When the employee applied for retirement benefits at or\nafter age 60, he received an annuity consisting of his own contributions, the employer\ncontributions, and earnings on all of the funds in his account.\nThe Service concluded that, with respect to the inclusion in income, compulsory\ncontributions designated as employee contributions should be treated as employee\ncontributions for purposes of the employee\u2019s annuities.  When an individual accepted\nemployment with the State of Arizona, he was subject to all the conditions and\nprovisions of law relating to the Arizona retirement system.  As such, he impliedly\nconsented to the withholding of a part of his compensation for the purpose of\npurchasing an annuity which, under the retirement system, became a vested right upon\nhis retirement.  Accordingly, the Service held that the amounts deducted from the\ncompensation of employees of the State of Arizona and credited to their retirement\naccounts constituted gross income within the meaning of section 61(a) and should be\nreported in the employees\u2019 annual Federal income tax returns for the year in which\ndeducted.\nIn Revenue Ruling 57-326, 1957-2 C.B. 42, the Service considered whether\ncompulsory but nonforfeitable contributions to a state retirement plan were includible in\nan employee\u2019s gross income.  The Service held that where under an ordinance or\nstatute of a municipality or state there is an employees\u2019 retirement plan, wherein\nemployee participation is compulsory, which contains a provision for the refund of an\nemployee\u2019s contributions in the event of termination of his services prior to retirement or\nPLR-121014-01\n-5-\ndeath, the amount of such employee\u2019s contributions which have been deducted from\nhis salary by the employer each year shall be included in his gross income for Federal\nincome tax purposes.  In view of the fact that the employee acquires a vested valuable\ninterest in the fund in the year his contribution is made, the situation is the same, from\nthe standpoint of Federal income taxation, as if he had received in cash the amount\npaid over to the fund for his benefit.\nFurthermore, the Service held that, where participation in the plan is voluntary\nand the employee is required to forfeit his own contributions should his services be\nterminated prior to retirement or death, the amount of the employee\u2019s contributions\nwhich have been deducted from his salary by the employer must be included in his\ngross income.  In this latter case, from the standpoint of Federal income taxation, the\nemployee has voluntarily directed that a part of his salary be paid under the plan in\norder to procure for himself or his beneficiaries the benefits of such plan.\nIn Revenue Ruling 72-94, 1972-1 C.B. 23, the Service considered the inclusion\nin gross income of amounts deducted from compensation as contributions by an\nemployee participant under an employees\u2019 nonqualified pension plan where\nparticipation was compulsory and contributions were forfeitable.  A number of states\nand municipalities had, by virtue of an ordinance or a statute, established nonqualified\npension or retirement plans for their employees.  In many of these plans, participation\nwas compulsory and the employees were required to contribute a certain percentage of\ntheir compensation to the trust forming a part of the plan.  Contributions were made by\ndeduction from the employees\u2019 periodic pay checks.  In some cases, the statute\nspecifically provided for the forfeiture of all or a part of the employees\u2019 contributions\nupon termination of employment prior to retirement, death, or before completion of a\nstated length of service.  In other cases, the statute was silent as to a refund of\ncontributions in such an event.  Thus, Revenue Ruling 72-94 considered a hybrid\n(compulsory but forfeitable contributions) of the fact patterns considered in Revenue\nRuling 57-326.\nInitially, Revenue Ruling 72-94 clarified the Service\u2019s holding in Revenue\nRuling 56-473.  The alternative (but not mutually exclusive) rationales for including\ncompulsory contributions in an employee\u2019s gross income for the year in which deducted\nwere the employee\u2019s implied consent to the contributions and the contribution\u2019s\nnonforfeitable character.  While it appears that the holding in Revenue Ruling 56-473 is\nbased only on the ground that the employee, by accepting employment with the state,\n\u201cimpliedly consents to the withholding of a part of his compensation,\u201d Revenue\nRuling 72-94 justifies the result by the fact that the contributions are nonforfeitable\nbecause the deducted contributions \u201care held by a retirement board and become\navailable to the employee only when the employee terminates his employment with the\nstate and withdraws his contribution.\u201d  Thus, Revenue Ruling 72-94 shifts the rationale\nfor inclusion in the employee\u2019s gross income from the employee\u2019s implied consent to\nthe contribution\u2019s nonforfeitable character.  While clarified, the holding in Revenue\nRuling 56-473 was nonetheless ratified.\nRevenue Ruling 72-94 concludes that where, under an ordinance or statute of a\nmunicipality or state or the rules of a governing body of an organization establishing an\nPLR-121014-01\n-6-\nemployees\u2019 nonqualified pension or retirement plan, participation is compulsory and the\nordinance, statute, or other rules (1) require the employee to forfeit his contributions in\nthe event of termination of service prior to death or before becoming eligible for\nretirement, or (2) are silent as to the refund of employee contributions and, in the\nadministration of the plan, no refund will be made in such event, the amounts withheld\nfrom the salary of an employee as contributions to the plan and applied solely to\nprovide deferred pensions are to be treated as employer contributions.  Accordingly, it\nwas held that those contributions were not required to be included in the employee\u2019s\ngross income for the year in which so contributed.  Consistent with the Service\u2019s earlier\nruling in Revenue Ruling 57-326, Revenue Ruling 72-94 also provides that where only a\nportion of the contributions is required to be forfeited in the event of the termination of\nthe employee\u2019s services, amounts not subject to forfeiture are required to be included in\nthe employee\u2019s gross income each year.\nThe Service\u2019s holdings in Revenue Ruling 56-473, Revenue Ruling 57-326, and\nRevenue Ruling 72-94 are consistent with the holdings and rationales of courts which\nhave considered whether compulsory contributions to state retirement plans are\nproperly characterized as employer contributions or as employee contributions, see\nHowell v. United States, 775 F.2d 887 (7th Cir. 1985) (holding that compulsory\ncontributions to a state retirement plan of amounts designated as employee\ncontributions and withheld from the employee\u2019s salary are employee contributions\nincludible in the employee\u2019s gross income); Zweiner v. Commissioner,\n743 F.2d 273 (5th Cir. 1984) (holding that compulsory, nonforfeitable contributions to a\nstate retirement plan having refund rights and benefits comparable to those of the\nfederal civil service system are employee contributions taxable as current income in the\nsame manner as federal employee contributions); Feistman v. Commissioner,\n63 T.C. 129 (1974) (stating that \u201cit has been established for many years that\n[compulsory contributions] withheld from salary and contributed to the applicable\nsystem are includible in the employee\u2019s currently reportable gross income\u201d); and\nFeistman v. Commissioner, 35 T.C.M. 1045 (1976) (addressing subsequent years and\nconcluding that \u201c[t]he principles which dictate the result when applied to the civil service\nsystem dictate the same conclusion when applied to the provisions of the [California]\nretirement systems involved herein.\u201d) Thus, compulsory, nonforfeitable contributions\nwhich are designated as employee contributions are properly characterized as\nemployee contributions rather than employer contributions for income tax purposes.\nIn Revenue Ruling 72-250, 1972-1 C.B. 22, the Service ratified its position that\nthe portion of a United States Government employee\u2019s compensation that is withheld\nand contributed to the United States Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund is a\ncontribution by the employee to such fund and is includible in his gross income in the\nsame taxable year in which it would have been included had it been paid to him directly. \nSimilar contributions were held to be employee contributions includible in the\nemployee\u2019s gross income in Taylor v. Commissioner, 2 T.C. 267 (1943), affirmed sub\nnom. Miller v. Commissioner, 144 F.2d 287 (4th Cir. 1944) (stating that \u201cat least to the\nextent that it consists of contributions by the employee out of his basic salary, the\npayment provided by the Retirement Act is a true annuity comparable to one which\nmight be subscribed for by any employer for the benefit of an employee and that it\nfollows that if under such circumstances an employee on a cash basis is chargeable\nwith the contribution to the cost of such an annuity made out of his salary, these\nPLR-121014-01\n-7-\n2  Section 414(h)(2) provides an exception to the general rule stated above for\nstate or local pick up plans.  In such plans, certain governmental units or agencies pick\nup what would otherwise be an employee contribution by not withholding the employee\ncontribution from the employee\u2019s salary.  The amount picked up is treated as an\nemployer contribution under section 414(h)(2).\npetitioners were required to include the amount of the disputed withholding in their\ntaxable income.\u201d); Megibow v. Commissioner, 21 T.C. 197 (1953), affd.\n218 F.2d 687 (3rd Cir. 1955) (concluding that \u201cthe cases . . . which the petitioner cites for\nthe proposition that mandatory withholdings from the pay of an employee for deposit in\na pension fund actually represent contributions by the employer, are not accepted as\nauthority for the proposition that this part of the petitioner\u2019s salary was not taxable to\nhim under the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code.\u201d); Cohen v. Commissioner,\n63 T.C. 267 (1974), affd per curiam, 543 F.2d 725 (9th Cir. 1976) (holding that \u201cwhether\nthe plan created by the Civil Service Act was a qualified plan or a nonqualified plan, the\namount withheld from the employee\u2019s salary to be put into the plan constitutes current\nincome to the employee in the year of the withholding.\u201d); Hogan v. United States,\n367 F. Supp. 1022 (E.D. Mich. 1973), affd. 513 F.2d 170. (6th Cir. 1975), cert. denied,\n423 U.S. 836, 96 S.Ct. 62 (1975).\nCongress subsequently endorsed and codified the characterization of\ncompulsory contributions as employee contributions with the enactment of\nsection 414(h)(1) as part of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974,\nPub. L. No. 93-406 (Sept. 2, 1974) (ERISA).  Code section 414(h)(1) provides that an\namount contributed to an employees\u2019 trust described in section 401(a) will not be\ntreated as having been made by the employer if it is designated as an employee\ncontribution.2  While the statutory designation test of section 414(h) does not literally\napply to nonqualified plans, the legal principles embodied in section 414(h) do.  The\nlegislative history to ERISA provides the following explanation regarding the\nsignificance of designating a contribution as either an employer contribution or an\nemployee contribution under the plan:\n \nDesignated contributions.\u2013Under present law, contributions which are\ndesignated as employee contributions are generally treated as employee\ncontributions for purposes of the Federal tax law.  For example, this is the\ncase with respect to employee contributions under the Federal Civil\nService plan.  Your committee\u2019s bill contains a provision to clarify this rule\nfor the future.  This provision provides that amounts that are contributed to\na qualified plan are not to be treated as an employer contribution if they\nare designated as employee contributions.\n \nThis provision gives effect to the source of the contributions, as\ndesignated in the plan.  For example, if the appropriate committees of the\nCongress were to report legislation regarding employee contributions\nunder the Federal Civil Service plan so that the present employee\u2019s\ncontributions would become employer contributions under the Federal\nCivil Service plan (and that legislation were to be enacted), then those\ncontributions would constitute employer contributions to the plan, which\nwould be excludible from the employee\u2019s income when made.  The same\nPLR-121014-01\n-8-\n3  Each unclassified employee\u2019s base salary is set forth in a contract of\nappointment executed on an annual basis.  Unclassified employees who are not\nrequired to participate in the Plan receive the entire amount of the base salary set forth\nin their contract of appointment.  Employees who are required to participate in the Plan\nreceive only the excess of their base salary over the amount of their compulsory\ncontributions.  Thus, the compulsory contributions are deducted from amounts\nTaxpayer would otherwise be obligated to pay the employees pursuant to their\ncontracts of appointment.\nrule would apply to State and local governmental plans which now\ndesignate contributions as employee contributions, if the appropriate\ngovernmental bodies change the provisions of their plans.\nH.R. Rep. No. 93-807, 93rd Cong., 2nd Sess. 145 (1974),1974-3\n(Supplement) C.B. 380.\nIn accordance with the forgoing administrative, judicial, and legislative authority,\nthe following three factors are relevant in determining whether compulsory contributions\nmade pursuant to a nonqualified defined contribution plan and used to purchase\nretirement annuity contracts are employer contributions or employee contributions for\npurposes of section 403(b) and section 3121(a)(5)(D):  1) whether the contributions are\ncompulsory under state or local law or are otherwise a condition of employment;\n2) whether the contributions are designated as employee contributions and are\ndeducted from the employee\u2019s base pay, salary, or compensation; and 3) whether the\ncontributions are fully vested and nonforfeitable when credited to the employee\u2019s\nretirement account.\nOn the facts presented, all unclassified employees working half time or more in a\nbenefits-eligible position are required by State statute to participate in the Plan and to\nbe covered by a valid retirement annuity contract issued by a life insurance company\ndesignated by Taxpayer.  Failure of an eligible employee to participate is cause for the\nemployee\u2019s immediate termination.  State statute also explicitly requires that eligible\nemployees contribute X% of their base salaries as fixed by Taxpayer towards the\npurchase of retirement annuity contracts.3  In contrast to these designated employee\ncontributions, Taxpayer has an independent statutory obligation to make an employer\ncontribution towards the purchase of a retirement annuity equal to Y% of the\nemployee\u2019s base salary.  Finally, each employee's rights in the retirement annuity\ncontract are fully vested and nonforfeitable at the time of the contribution.\nIn accordance with the forgoing analysis, we conclude that, absent a legally\nbinding salary reduction agreement, compulsory contributions made pursuant to the\nPlan and used to purchase retirement annuity contracts do not constitute employer\ncontributions for purposes of section 403(b) and section 3121(a)(5)(D).\nWe must next determine whether compulsory contributions made pursuant to a\nlegally binding salary reduction agreement constitute employer contributions for\npurposes of section 403(b) and section 3121(a)(5)(D).  In Revenue Ruling 70-582,\n1970-2 C.B. 95, the Service considered whether contributions by a state college to\npurchase a retirement annuity pursuant to a salary reduction agreement, where a state\nstatute required employee contributions toward retirement and permitted such\nPLR-121014-01\n-9-\ncontributions by salary reduction agreements or salary deductions, constituted\nemployer contributions for purposes of section 403(b).  The state statute required a\ncontribution of a specified percentage of the annual compensation of employees of\nstate educational institutions toward the employees\u2019 retirement.  The statute provided\nthat each educational institution would determine whether contributions for its\nemployees would be made by means of a deduction (withholding) from the employees\u2019\nsalary or by means of salary reduction agreements.\nPursuant to this statute, a state college entered into an agreement with one of its\nfaculty members whereby the member\u2019s salary was reduced and the amount of the\nreduction was applied by the college toward the purchase of a nonforfeitable,\nnontransferable individual annuity contract.  Citing section 1.403(b)-1(b)(3) of the\nIncome Tax Regulations, the Service held that the exclusion provisions of\nsection 403(b) were applicable to the reduction agreement and, consequently, that the\ncompulsory contribution constituted an employer contribution by operation of the salary\nreduction agreement.  Thus, Revenue Ruling 70-582 illustrates that employers and\nemployees may enter into legally binding salary reduction agreements notwithstanding\na statutory mandate requiring employee contributions.\nIn University of North Dakota v. United States, 603 F2d 702 (8th Cir. 1979), the\ncourt considered whether contributions made by the University of North Dakota to the\nNorth Dakota State Employees Retirement Program pursuant to salary reduction\nagreements constituted wages subject to withholding under section 3401(a)(12)(A) (for\npurposes of income tax withholding at source on wages.)  The North Dakota statutes\ngoverning the plan required both employers and employees to make contributions to\nthe plan.  For the years at issue, the university employees executed salary reduction\nagreements pursuant to which each employee\u2019s salary was reduced by the amount of\nhis contribution to the plan and the university\u2019s contribution was increased by a like\namount.  The sole purpose of these salary reduction agreements (as found by the\ncourt) was to defer taxation on all contributions made to the plan.\nThe university contended that the increased contributions were employer\ncontributions and, thus, were not wages subject to withholding under\nsection 3401(a)(12)(A).  Conversely, the Government contended that because state law\nrequired employee contributions to be withheld from the employees\u2019 pay, the additional\namounts transmitted by the University pursuant to the salary reduction agreements\nconstituted wages subject to withholding (i.e., remained employee contributions\nnotwithstanding the salary reduction agreements.)  In effect, the Government\ncontended that the salary reduction agreements were ineffectual with respect to the\nemployees\u2019 compulsory contributions.  The court concluded, however, that the precise\nmanner in which mandatory contributions were made fell within the administrative\ndiscretion of the state board.  Salary reduction agreements authorized by the state\nboard altered the provision of the plan so that the contributions were designated as\nemployer contributions.\nThe effect of the district court\u2019s holding is that the appropriate governmental\nbody, i.e., the State Board, has altered the provisions of the Plan by the salary\nPLR-121014-01\n-10-\n4  The State was able to assert this argument because the designated employee\ncontributions were treated as employer contributions for income tax purposes pursuant\nto section 414(h)(2).  Consequently, no salary reduction agreement was needed to\nconvert the employee contributions into employer contributions.  Pursuant to\nsection 403(b), however, compulsory employee contributions are treated as employer\ncontributions for income tax purposes only by operation of a legally binding salary\nreduction agreement.  The salary reduction agreement that converts compulsory\nemployee contributions into employer contributions for purposes of section 403(b) also\ncauses the resulting employer contributions to be characterized as wages pursuant to\nsection 3121(a)(5)(D).\nreduction agreements so that the challenged contributions now are designated\nas employer contributions.\nUniversity of North Dakota v. United States, 603 F2d 702 (8th Cir. 1979)\nThus, if an employee enters into a legally binding salary reduction agreement, a\ncompulsory contribution that would otherwise be taxable as an employee contribution\nmay be treated as an employer contribution if such characterization is consistent with\nstatutory intent.\nIn Public Employees\u2019 Retirement Board v. Shalala,\n153 F.3rd 1160 (10th Cir. 1998) the court considered whether contributions to a\nretirement plan made by the state of New Mexico for its employees after a\ncorresponding reduction in the employees\u2019 gross salary were made pursuant to a salary\nreduction agreement where the contributions were mandated by State statute.  Though\nthe court was considering mandatory contributions in the context of a section 414(h)(2)\npick up plan and salary reduction agreements for purposes of section 3121(v)(1)(B),\nboth section 3121(a)(5)(D) and section 3121(v)(1)(B) refer to contributions made by\nreason of \u201ca salary reduction agreement (whether evidenced by a written agreement or\notherwise).\u201d\nThe State contended that a salary reduction agreement excludes arrangements\nin which the employees\u2019 participation in the salary reduction plan is mandated by state\nstatute.4  The court concluded, however, that, for purposes of section 3121(v)(1)(B), \u201ca\nsalary reduction agreement necessarily includes any arrangement in which there is a\nreduction in an employee\u2019s salary in exchange for the employer\u2019s contribution of the\namount of the reduction to a pension plan on the employee\u2019s behalf.\u201d  While the court\u2019s\nreasoning turned on the mandatory nature of a pick up plan under section 414(h)(2), a\nsimilar reading of substantially identical language under section 3121(a)(5)(D) is\ncompletely consistent with the purpose of that provision.\nAs indicated above, the Service and the courts have recognized that a legally\nbinding salary reduction agreement converts a compulsory contribution from an\nemployee contribution to an employer contribution by reducing the amount otherwise\nowed as salary by the employer to the employee.  In the absence of a legally binding\nsalary reduction agreement, the compulsory contributions must constitute employee\ncontributions for Taxpayer to satisfy its salary obligations under the appointment\ncontracts.  A legally binding salary reduction agreement reduces Taxpayer\u2019s salary\nPLR-121014-01\n-11-\n5  As discussed above, section 414(h)(1) precludes the use of salary reduction\nagreements to convert designated employee contributions into employer contributions\nunder certain circumstances.\nobligations under the appointment contract, thereby allowing the contributions to be\ntreated as employer contributions on a dollar-for-dollar basis.  It is the amount of the\nsalary reduction, no longer owed to the employee, that funds the employer\u2019s\nsupplemental contributions to the plan.5\nBoth Revenue Ruling 70-582 and University of North Dakota demonstrate that\ncompulsory employee contributions (mandated by statute) may be converted to\nemployer contributions by operation of a legally binding salary reduction agreement. \nSpecifically, with respect to retirement annuity contracts described in section 403(b),\nRevenue Ruling 70-582 authorizes treating compulsory employee contributions as\nemployer contributions pursuant to a salary reduction agreement.  In Public Employees\u2019\nRetirement Board the designated employee contributions were treated as employer\ncontributions by operation of a section 414(h)(2) pick up, but the mandatory\ncontributions were nonetheless determined to be made pursuant to a salary reduction\nagreement for purposes of section 3121(v)(1)(B).  Consequently, we conclude that\ncompulsory contributions made pursuant to a legally binding salary reduction\nagreement constitute employer contributions for purposes of section 403(b) and\nsection 3121(a)(5)(D).\nIn Revenue Ruling 2000-35, 2000-2 C.B. 138, the Service considered whether\ncontributions used to purchase an annuity contract described in section 403(b) and\nmade pursuant to an elective deferral arrangement are properly treated as having been\nmade pursuant to a salary reduction agreement.  Citing section 1450(a) of the Small\nBusiness Job Protection Act of 1996, the Service stated that the frequency with which\nsalary reduction agreements may be entered into, the salary to which such agreements\napply, and the ability to revoke such agreements will be determined under the rules\napplicable to cash or deferred elections.  Thus, with respect to elective deferral\narrangements, the provisions of section 1.403(b)-1(b)(3) relating to salary reduction\nagreements were superceded by the provisions applicable to cash or deferred\nelections.\nA cash or deferred arrangement is an arrangement under which an eligible\nemployee may make a cash or deferred election with respect to contributions to a plan\nthat is intended to satisfy the requirements of section 401(a).  A cash or deferred\nelection is any election by an employee to have an employer either provide an amount\nto the employee in the form of cash or contribute an amount to a trust under a plan\ndeferring the receipt of compensation.  Thus, a cash or deferred election requires that\nthe employee have an election between the employer paying cash to the employee or\nmaking a contribution to a trust on behalf of the employee.  Consequently, a cash or\ndeferred election does not include compulsory contributions.\nRevenue Ruling 2000-35 relates to salary reduction agreements under elective\ndeferral arrangements.  Compulsory contributions are not made pursuant to elective\ndeferral arrangements.  Rather, compulsory contributions are analogous to designated\nPLR-121014-01\n-12-\nemployee contributions under section 414(h)(1).  The application of Revenue\nRuling 2000-35 to compulsory contributions would preclude making compulsory\ncontributions pursuant to a salary reduction agreement and, consequently, would\npreclude treating compulsory contributions as employer contributions for purposes of\nsection 403(b) and section 3121(a)(5)(D).  Compulsory contributions are not made\npursuant to a cash or deferred election and can be made pursuant to a salary reduction\nagreement for purposes of section 403(b).  Consequently, Revenue Ruling 2000-35\ndoes not apply to compulsory contributions made pursuant to salary reduction\nagreements.\nFinally, we must determine whether the salary reduction agreements entered into\nby and between Taxpayer and its eligible employees constitute legally binding salary\nreduction agreements.  While State statute requires employees to contribute X% of\ntheir base salaries to the plan, it contemplates that the contribution will be made on a\n\u201cpretax basis.\u201d  The only method for converting compulsory employee contributions\ntowards the purchase of a retirement annuity contract into employer contributions is a\nsalary reduction agreement.  Additionally, the resolution describing the provisions of the\nretirement plan authorized by law and established by Taxpayer specifically provides that\nPlan contributions by a participant will be made \u201con a tax-deferred basis under an\nagreement for salary reduction executed in accordance with section 403(b) of the\nInternal Revenue Code.\u201d  The salary reduction agreement itself specifically provides\nthat Taxpayer \u201cis authorized and directed to reduce my compensation to purchase for\nme a non-forfeitable annuity or annuities as hereinafter described.\u201d  Finally, the salary\nreduction agreement provides that \u201c[T]his agreement shall be legally binding and\nirrevocable as to both the parties hereto while employment continues\u201d and is signed by\nboth the employee and Taxpayer.\nConclusion\nWe conclude that, based on State statute, the Plan documents, and the salary\nreduction agreement entered into between each employee and Taxpayer, a legally\nbinding salary reduction agreement was intended and was in fact entered into. \nConsequently, pursuant to those legally binding salary reduction agreements,\ncompulsory contributions that would otherwise be employee contributions are properly\ncharacterized as employer contributions for purposes of section 3121(a)(5)(D).  As\nemployer contributions made by reason of salary reduction agreements, the\ncontributions are includible in wages for FICA tax purposes.\nExcept as expressly provided herein, no opinion is expressed or implied\nconcerning the tax consequences of any aspect of any transaction or item discussed or\nreferenced in this letter.

Additional information was submitted in letters dated March 21, 2012 \nand April 17, 2012, and additional representations were submitted in letters dated April \n5, 2012, April 17, 2012, April 24, 2012, and June 12, 2012.\nThe rulings contained in this letter are based upon information and \nrepresentations submitted by the taxpayer and accompanied by a penalty of perjury \nstatement executed by an appropriate party.   While this office has not verified any of \nthe material submitted in support of the request for rulings, it is subject to verification on \nexamination.\nFACTS\nPLR-107628-12\n3\nPrior to the Acquisition (as defined below), Parent was a State A corporation and \nwas the common parent of an affiliated group of corporations that filed a consolidated \nfederal income tax return on a calendar year basis (the \u201cParent Group\u201d).  Prior to the \nAcquisition, Parent owned all of the outstanding stock of FS 1, a Country X corporation, \nSub 1, a State A limited liability company, and Sub 2, a State B corporation.  FS 1 is \nengaged in the business of E in Country X.  Purchaser is a State A corporation and is \nthe common parent of an affiliated group of corporations that files a consolidated federal \nincome tax return (the \u201cPurchaser Group\u201d).  \nEntity 1, Parent\u2019s predecessor by merger, made an election under section \n1504(d) to treat FS 1 as a domestic corporation for all purposes of subtitle A of the \nCode (the \u201cElection\u201d) on its Form 1120 for the taxable year ended Date A.  Thereafter \nand until the Acquisition, FS 1 joined in the filing of a consolidated federal income tax \nreturn with Entity 1 or Parent as the common parent.  On Date C, a wholly owned \nsubsidiary of Purchaser acquired all of the outstanding shares of Parent (the \n\u201cAcquisition\u201d) from an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of Owner, and certain other \npersons in exchange for cash pursuant to an Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of \nDate B.  The Parent Group terminated as of Date C.  On Date D, Parent was converted \ninto a limited liability company and renamed Entity 2.  In connection with the Acquisition, \nParent requested consent to revoke its election made with respect to FS 1 under \nsection 1504(d), effective as of Date C (the \u201cRevocation\u201d), which would cause FS 1 to \nconstructively transfer all of its assets and liabilities (the \u201cTransaction\u201d) to a Country X \ncorporation (\u201cNew FS 1\u201d).\nREPRESENTATIONS\nParent and Entity 2 have provided the following representations in connection \nwith Parent\u2019s request for a private letter ruling.\n(a)\nNeither Parent nor Purchaser has a plan or intention to include FS 1 or its \nsuccessor entity in any future federal income tax return filed by the Parent Group or the \nPurchaser Group (or by another affiliated group with the same common parent or a \nsuccessor of such common parent) after the Transaction. \n(b)\nNeither the Parent Group nor the Purchaser Group will include FS 1 or \nany successor thereof in any U.S. federal income tax return filed by it (or by another \naffiliated group with the same common parent or a successor of such common parent) \nbefore the 61st month beginning after its first taxable year in which FS 1 ceased to be a \nmember of the Parent Group. \n(c)\nNeither Parent nor Purchaser will make a section 1504(d) election with \nrespect to FS 1 or any successor entity thereof before the 61st month beginning after \nthe Transaction. \nPLR-107628-12\n4\n(d)\nNew FS 1 (or any successor entity thereof) will continue FS 1\u2019s historic \nbusiness after the Transaction.\n(e)\nThe fair market value of the New FS 1 shares constructively issued in the \nTransaction approximately equaled the fair market value of the FS 1 shares deemed \nsurrendered in the Transaction.\n(f)\nParent owned all the outstanding stock of New FS 1 constructively issued \nin the Transaction and owned such stock by reason of its ownership of the FS 1 shares \nimmediately prior to the Transaction. \n(g)\nImmediately after the consummation of the Transaction, New FS 1 \npossessed the same assets and liabilities, except for assets used to pay expenses \nincurred in connection with the Transaction (if any), as those possessed by FS 1 \nimmediately before the Transaction.  Assets used to pay expenses (if any) constituted \nless than one percent of the fair market value of the net assets of FS 1 immediately \nbefore the Transaction.  No assets were distributed by FS 1 pursuant to the \nTransaction.\n(h)\nAny liabilities of FS 1 that were constructively assumed (as determined \nunder section 357(d)) by New FS 1 in the Transaction were incurred in the ordinary \ncourse of business and are associated with the assets constructively transferred.   \n(i)\nThere is no plan or intention for New FS 1 to issue any additional stock \nfollowing the Transaction, except possibly in connection solely with a post-closing \ninternal restructuring undertaken by Purchaser. \n(j)\nAt the time of the Transaction,  FS 1 did not have outstanding any \nwarrants, options, convertible securities, or other type of right pursuant to which any \nperson could acquire shares in FS 1.  \n(k)\nAll parties have paid and will pay their respective expenses, if any, \nincurred in connection with the Transaction, except that Purchaser has borne, and will \nbear, all reasonable costs and expenses associated with the preparation and filing of \nthis private letter ruling request.\n(l)\n FS 1 is not under the jurisdiction of a court in a title 11 or similar case \nwithin the meaning of section 368(a)(3)(A).\n(m)\nThe Parent Group will take into account any income, gain, or recapture \nresulting from the Revocation, including any income arising as a result of the application \nof section 367(a), section 367(d), section 904(f), section 987, section 1503(d), and the \nregulations thereunder, as applicable. \nPLR-107628-12\n5\n(n)\nOn its Form 1120 for the taxable year ended Date A, Entity 1 made a valid \nsection 1504(d) election with respect to FS 1.  At all times from the effective date of the \nElection through the date of the Acquisition, one hundred percent of the capital stock of \nFS 1 (exclusive of directors\u2019 qualifying shares) was owned by Entity 1 and Parent, Entity\n1\u2019s successor by merger.\n(o)\nFS 1 was organized under the laws of Country X and has been maintained \nsolely for the purpose of complying with the laws of Country X as to title and operation \nof property at all times since the effective date of the Election.\n(p)\nFS 1 would not have been allowed to operate its business E in Country X \nbut for its formation as a corporation under the laws of Country X.\n(q)\nTo the best of taxpayer\u2019s knowledge, the sole reason FS 1 was organized \nand maintained under the laws of Country X was to conduct its predominant business of \nE in County X.\n(r)\nParent received no assets as a result of the Revocation other than its \ndeemed receipt of New FS 1 stock.\n(s)\nThe Parent Group will report the tax consequences of the Revocation on \nits federal income tax return for its taxable year that ended as a result of the Acquisition \n(in which the Parent Group terminated).\n(t)\nThe acquiring corporation in the Acquisition is a U.S. corporation that is a \nmember of an affiliated group of corporations that file a consolidated U.S. federal tax \nreturn.\nANALYSIS\nSection 1504(d) provides that a domestic corporation, owning or controlling, \ndirectly or indirectly, 100 percent of a corporation organized under the laws of a \ncontiguous foreign country and maintained solely for the purpose of complying with the \nlaws of such country as to title and operation of property, may elect to treat such a \ncorporation as a domestic corporation for federal income tax purposes. \nTreas. Reg. \u00a7 1.367(a)-1T(c)(5) states that section 367(a) applies to the \ntermination of a section 1504(d) election.  The Revocation in this case resulted in a \nconstructive transfer of all the assets and liabilities of FS 1 to New FS 1, a foreign \ncorporation, in exchange for all of the stock of New FS 1. FS 1 was then deemed to \nmake a liquidating distribution of all the stock of New FS 1 to Parent.  Following the \ntermination of the section 1504(d) election, New FS 1 became a Country X corporation \nthat is treated as a foreign corporation for United States federal tax purposes. \nPLR-107628-12\n6\nThe termination of a section 1504(d) election has collateral consequences under \nthe Code and regulations. The revocation of a section 1504(d) election involves a \ntransfer of the assets of a foreign branch of a United States corporation to a foreign\ncorporation, which is subject to the provisions of sections 367(a) and (d) and the \nregulations thereunder.  The revocation of a section 1504(d) election will generally \ntrigger gain or loss under section 987 and recapture under section 904(f). The \nrevocation of such an election also constitutes a triggering event under Treas. Reg. \u00a7 \n1.1503(d)-6(e)(i) or Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.1503-2(g)(2)(iii)(A), as applicable, requiring the \nrecapture of any dual consolidated losses incurred by a foreign branch of the taxpayer.\nRULINGS\nBased solely upon the information and representations submitted in the \ntaxpayer\u2019s ruling request, we rule as follows:\n1.\nConsent is hereby granted to Parent to revoke the Election. \n2.\nThe Revocation was effective as of Date C. \n3.\nFS 1 ceased to be a member of the Parent Group at the end of the day on \nwhich the section 1504(d) election is revoked.\n4.\nThe Transaction, as described above, constituted a reorganization within \nthe meaning of section 368(a)(1)(F). Rev. Rul. 87-27, 1987-1 C.B. 138.  FS 1 and New\nFS 1 were each \u201ca party to the reorganization\u201d within the meaning of section 368(b).\n5.\nNo gain or loss was recognized by FS 1 on the constructive transfer of its \nassets to New FS 1. Sections 361(a) and 357(a). \n6.\nNo gain or loss was recognized by New FS 1 on its constructive receipt of \nthe assets from FS 1 in constructive exchange for New FS 1 stock.

Prior to the due date, including extensions, \nfor Corporation\u2019s income tax return for the taxable year ending on c, Corporation, on \nbehalf of itself and members of its controlled group, requested permission to revoke its \n\u00a7 41(c)(4) election for the taxable year ending on c and all subsequent years. \n \nFor taxable years beginning after June 30, 1996, taxpayers may elect to determine their \nresearch credit under the AIRC rules of ' 41(c)(4). Section 41(c)(4)(B) provides that any \nelection under ' 41(c)(4)(A) shall apply for the taxable year in which made and all \nsucceeding taxable years unless revoked with the consent of the Secretary. \n \nPLR-148661-04 \n \n2 \n \nBased solely on the facts submitted and representations made, we grant permission for \nCorporation to revoke its election to determine its research credit under the AIRC rules \nof ' 41(c)(4) for qualified research expenses paid or incurred during the taxable year \nending on c.  Corporation should compute the research credit for the taxable year \nending on c and all succeeding taxable years using the general rule of ' 41(a), provided \nthat neither Corporation nor any member of its controlled group makes a new election to \ndetermine its research credit under the AIRC rules of  ' 41(c)(4) in a later year.  \n \nExcept as expressly provided herein, we express or imply no opinion concerning the tax \nconsequences of any aspect of any transaction or item discussed or referenced in this \nletter.  Further, we express or imply no opinion concerning expenditures Corporation or \nany member of its controlled group treated as qualified research expenses. \n \nThis ruling is directed only to the taxpayer requesting it.

The material information provided in that letter and in \nsubsequent correspondence is summarized below.  \nThe rulings contained in this letter are based upon facts and representations submitted \nby the taxpayer and accompanied by a penalty of perjury statement executed by an \nappropriate party.  While this office has not verified any of the materials submitted in \nsupport of the request for rulings, it is subject to verification on examination.  \nSummary of Facts\nPrior to the Transaction, FPS, an entity organized under the laws of Country B, treated \nas a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and a group of public investors \nowned a percent and b percent, respectively, of the issued and outstanding ownership \ninterests in Foreign Parent, an entity organized under the laws of Country A and treated \nas a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes.  Foreign Parent, along with its \nsubsidiaries (Foreign Parent and its subsidiaries collectively the \u201cCompany\u201d), is \nengaged in Business A, Business B and Business C.  \nForeign Parent owned, indirectly through its subsidiaries, f percent of the issued and \noutstanding ownership interests in FSub1, an entity organized under the laws of \nCountry B and treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes. FSub1 \nowned f percent of the issued and outstanding ownership interests in FDRE1, an entity \norganized under the laws of Country A and treated as a disregarded entity for U.S. \nfederal income tax purposes.  FDRE1 owned f percent of the issued and outstanding \nownership interests in Parent, a State A corporation.  Parent is the common parent of \nan affiliated group of corporations that join in the filing of a consolidated tax return for \nU.S. federal income tax purposes (the \u201cParent Group\u201d).  \nFDRE1 also owned f percent of the issued and outstanding ownership interests in \nFSub2, an entity organized under the laws of Country A and treated as a corporation for \nU.S. federal income tax purposes. FSub2 owned f percent of the issued and \noutstanding ownership interests in more than x foreign legal entities organized in \nvarious foreign jurisdictions (such entities collectively the \u201cFDRE1 Foreign Entities\u201d).  \nThe FDRE1 Foreign Entities were not controlled foreign corporations (\u201cCFCs\u201d) within \nthe meaning of section 957(a) prior to the Transaction.   \n   \nPLR-113339-14\n4\nParent owned, indirectly, f percent of the issued and outstanding ownership interests in \nSub1, a State B corporation that is a member of the Parent Group.   Sub1 owned f\npercent of the issued and outstanding ownership interests in DRE1, a limited liability \ncompany organized under the laws of State B that is treated as a disregarded entity for \nU.S. federal income tax purposes.  DRE1 owned f percent of the issued and \noutstanding ownership interests in Sub2, a State B corporation.  Prior to the \nTransaction, Sub1 and Sub2 were each members of the Parent Group. \nDRE1 also owned f percent of the issued and outstanding ownership interests in \nFDRE2, an entity organized under the laws of Country A and treated as a disregarded \nentity for U.S. federal income tax purposes.  FDRE2 owned f percent of the issued and \noutstanding ownership interests in FSub3, an entity organized under the laws of \nCountry A and treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes.  FSub3 \nowned, directly and indirectly, f percent of the issued and outstanding ownership \ninterests in more than y foreign legal entities organized in various foreign jurisdictions \n(such entities collectively the \u201cParent Group Foreign Entities\u201d), the majority of which are \ntreated as disregarded entities for U.S. federal income tax purposes.  FSub3 and the \nParent Group Foreign Entities which are treated as corporations for U.S. federal income \ntax purposes (such entities collectively the \u201cParent Group Foreign Corporate Entities\u201d) \nare CFCs. \nPrior to the Transaction, significant overlap existed between the place of formation and \nbusiness operations of the Parent Group Foreign Entities and the FDRE1 Foreign \nEntities. The Company undertook the Transaction as part of the Global Structure \nAlignment Plan to consolidate the Parent Group Foreign Entities and the FDRE1 \nForeign Entities underneath the Parent Group in order to facilitate the reduction of such \noverlapping legal entities and simplify its overall global structure.  \nPrior to the Transaction, the Parent Group had a consolidated overall foreign loss \n(\u201cCOFL\u201d) account,  a consolidated separate loss limitation (\u201cCSLL\u201d) account,  and an \noverall domestic loss (\u201cODL\u201d) account.  All income, loss, tax attributes, and COFL and \nCSLL accounts currently are, and are expected to continue to be, in the section 904(d) \ngeneral category, except for a small ODL in the passive category.\nTHE TRANSACTION\nPursuant to a pre-arranged plan and for the business reasons described above, the \nfollowing transactions were undertaken:\n1. On Date 1, Sub1 formed Holdco, a limited liability company organized under the \nlaws of State B.  Holdco subsequently made a valid Entity Classification Election \n(\u201ccheck-the-box election\u201d) to be treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income \ntax purposes from its inception.  On Date 3, following the date of Contribution 1 \nbut prior to the date of Contribution 2 (each described below), the articles of \nPLR-113339-14\n5\nincorporation for Holdco were amended to convert Holdco from a limited liability \ncompany to a corporation under State B law. \n2. On Date 2, Sub1 contributed its ownership interests in DRE1 (along with certain \nintercompany agreements) to Holdco solely in exchange for all of the issued and \noutstanding ownership interests in Holdco (\u201cContribution 1\u201d).\n3. On Date 4, FDRE1 contributed its ownership interests in FSub2 to FDRE3, a \nnewly formed entity organized under the laws of Country A treated from its \ninception as a disregarded entity for U.S. federal income tax purposes.  \nImmediately following this transfer, FDRE1 contributed certain assets, including \nall of its interests in FDRE3, to Holdco solely in exchange for common stock in \nHoldco (\u201cContribution 2\u201d). Immediately after Contribution 2, FSub1 and Sub1 \nowned c percent and d percent, respectively, of the vote and value in the issued \nand outstanding common stock of Holdco.  As a result of Contribution 2, Sub1\u2019s \nownership of Holdco no longer met the requirement of section 1504(a)(2), and \nHoldco became the parent of a consolidated group that includes Sub2.  \nREPRESENTATIONS\nParent makes the following representations with respect to the Transaction:\n1. Holdco was an \u201celigible entity\u201d within the meaning of Treas. Reg. \u00a7 301.7701-3 \nupon its formation.\n2. Holdco was an includible corporation within the meaning of section 1504(b) when \nit made an election to be treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax \npurposes from its inception.\n3. The Parent Group constitutes an affiliated group of entities that are eligible to file \nand file a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return under section 1504, which \nincludes all appropriate members.\n4. The Parent Group Foreign Corporate Entities were CFCs within the meaning of \nsection 957(a) at the time of Contribution 1 and remained CFCs after \nContribution 1.  \n5. Contribution 1 qualified as an exchange to which section 351(a) applied.\n6. Holdco and its group members have made a valid consolidated return election, \nand, effective Date 5, the consolidated returns to be filed by the group will include \nall appropriate members.\n7. At the time of Contribution 1, the Parent Group had a COFL and CSLL in its \ngeneral category as well as a small ODL account in the passive category.   \nPLR-113339-14\n6\n8. Following Contribution 1 and Contribution 2, Sub1 and FSub1 own d percent and \nc percent, respectively, of the outstanding common stock of Holdco.  Holdco has \nno other class of stock outstanding.  \nRulings\nBased solely upon the information submitted and the representations made, we rule as \nfollows on the Transaction:\n1. Holdco is considered a member of the Parent Group for the time period between \nDate 1 and Contribution 2.\n2. Since Holdco is considered a member of the Parent Group for the time period \nbetween Date 1 and Contribution 2, Contribution 1 is an intercompany \ntransaction within the meaning of Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.1502-13(b).\n3. Since Contribution 1 is an intercompany transaction within the meaning of Treas. \nReg. \u00a7 1.1502-13(b), except to the extent required by Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.1502-\n9(b)(6)(i), no recapture will arise under section 904(f)(3) or section 904(f)(5)(F) at \nthe time of either Contribution 1 or Contribution 2 to reduce the Parent Group\u2019s \nCOFL and CSLL accounts that are apportioned at the time of Contribution 2 \nbetween the Parent Group, Holdco, and Sub2 under Treas. Reg. \u00a7 1.1502-\n9(c)(2).\nCaveats\nExcept as expressly provided herein, no opinion is expressed or implied concerning the \ntax consequences of any aspect of any transaction or item discussed or referenced in \nthis letter. \nProcedural Statements\nThis ruling is directed only to the taxpayer requesting it.  Section 6110(k)(3) of the Code \nprovides that it may not be used or cited as precedent.  \nA copy of this letter must be attached to any income tax return to which it is relevant.  \nAlternatively, taxpayers filing their returns electronically may satisfy this requirement by \nattaching a statement to their return that provides the date and control number of this \nletter ruling.\nPLR-113339-14\n7\nIn accordance with the power of attorney on file with this office, a copy of this ruling \nletter is being sent to your authorized representatives.\nSincerely,\nJeffrey L.

In accordance with the Plan of Divestiture, Parent and Corporation 1 \npropose the following series of steps comprising an integrated transaction (collectively, \nthe AProposed Transaction@): \n \n(i) \nSeller will form Newco with a minimal amount of capital. \n \n(ii) \nSeller will execute a firm commitment underwriting agreement with the \nunderwriters, pursuant to which Seller will be obligated to effect the sale of \nNewco common stock and the Newco Convertible Instrument in the Initial \nPublic Offering (as described in Step (iv) below). \n \n(iii) \nSeller will transfer all of its stock interest in the Purchased Subsidiaries, \ntogether with Additional Assets (defined below), to Newco in exchange for \n100% of the common stock of Newco, 100% of the Newco Convertible \nInstrument, the assumption by Newco of certain liabilities of Seller, and \nadditional non-stock consideration, such as a short-term promissory note \nor cash.  Seller and Newco will enter into the appropriate contractual \narrangements, including a tax sharing agreement and any other \ntransitional and service agreements customary, proper or otherwise \nadvisable in these circumstances. \n \n(iv) \nIn accordance with the firm commitment underwriting agreement executed \nin Step (ii) above, Seller will sell to the underwriters for cash, for resale to \nthe public (1) more than 20% of the Newco common stock (acquired in \n9 \nPLR-147933-03 \n \n \nStep (iii) above) and (2) all or substantially all of the Newco Convertible \nInstrument (acquired in Step (iii) above) (collectively, the \u201cInitial Public \nOffering\u201d).  In the Initial Public Offering, Newco will neither sell any stock \nto the public nor receive any funds from the public in exchange for stock.  \nThe Initial Public Offering will be implemented within approximately n2 \nbusiness days of the completion of Step (iii).  \n \n(v) \nNewco and Parent will make timely elections under section 338(h)(10) in \nrespect of certain Purchased Subsidiaries.  It is expected that elections \nunder section 338(h)(10) will also be made in respect of the deemed \nacquisitions of certain indirect and direct domestic subsidiaries of the \nPurchased Subsidiaries.   \n \n(vi) \nWithin n3 months after Step (iv), Seller will undertake one or more \nadditional public offerings (\u201cAdditional Offerings\u201d) of Newco common stock \nthat together will, taking into account the Initial Public Offering and any \nother transactions or events taking place during the n3-month period, \nreduce Seller\u2019s direct and indirect stock ownership of Newco to less than \n50% of the value of Newco stock (this threshold of stock ownership as it \npertains to Newco stock shall hereinafter be referred to as \u201cless than 50%\u201d \nor \u201cbelow 50%\u201d).  If prior to the end of this n3-month period, Seller for any \nreason has not reduced its stock ownership of Newco below 50% through \none or more Additional Offerings, Seller will, in accordance with the Plan \nof Divestiture, reduce its stock ownership of Newco below 50% within n3 \nmonths after Step (iv) through one or more alternative or additional \ntransactions, including a private negotiated sale of Newco stock and/or \nother alternative transactions, dispositions or transfers.  \n \n  \n\u201cAdditional Assets\u201d as used in Step (iii) above shall refer to the following \ncollectively: a p1% common stock interest in Sub 1, an indirect subsidiary of Seller; a \npreferred stock interest in Sub 2, an indirect subsidiary of Seller; a p2% partnership \ninterest in Partnership; $n4 surplus notes receivable from Sub 3, an indirect subsidiary \nof Seller; nominal amounts of fixed assets; and certain intercompany receivables and \nobligations.  \n \n \nThe Proposed Transaction will result in Newco owning 100% of the stock of the \nPurchased Subsidiaries and Seller owning less than 50% of the stock of Newco within \nn3 months after Step (iv) of the Proposed Transaction.  \n \n \nREPRESENTATIONS     \n10 \nPLR-147933-03 \n \n \n \nThe following representations have been made in connection with the Proposed \nTransaction: \n \n(a)  \nParent and Corporation 1 plan to dispose of more than 50% of the Purchased \nSubsidiaries in the Proposed Transaction. \n  \n(b)  \nA sale to the public of less than 50% of Newco (after the Purchased Subsidiaries \nhave been transferred by Seller to Newco) would not achieve the objectives of \nParent and Corporation 1 in connection with the planned disposition of the \nPurchased Subsidiaries.  In addition, Parent and Corporation 1 would not effect \nthe proposed transfer of the Purchased Subsidiaries to Newco and the Initial \nPublic Offering without being reasonably certain, based on advice received from \ntheir financial advisors, that they will be able to effect a disposition of sufficient \nadditional shares of Newco to reduce their ownership of Newco below 50% \nthrough one or more additional public offerings.  \n  \n(c)  \nNewco has not purchased and has no plan to purchase any stock of Parent, \nCorporation 1 or Seller, other than any stock of Parent or Corporation 1 \npurchased for investment purposes by the Industry B subsidiaries of Seller (or \nNewco) in the ordinary course of business.\n \n(d) \nAll of the stock of the Purchased Subsidiaries will be acquired by Newco in a \nsingle transfer by Seller, described in Step (iii) of the Proposed Transaction. \n  \n(e) \n(i) Seller is a member of the selling consolidated group (as defined in section \n338(h)(10)(B)), of which Parent is the common parent, and will be so for the \ntaxable period that includes the date on which Newco will acquire the Purchased \nSubsidiaries; (ii) For the taxable period that includes the date on which Newco \nwill acquire the Purchased Subsidiaries, each domestic Purchased Subsidiary is \nand will be a consolidated target within the meaning of Treas. Reg. Section \n1.338(h)(10)-1(b)(1), with the following exception: Target 19, a Country A \ncompany taxed as a domestic -------------------company pursuant to an election ----\n-----------------------------is and will be an affiliated target, and Seller is and will be a \nselling affiliate with respect to Target 19, within the meaning of Treas. Reg. \nSection 1.338(h)(10)-1(b)(3); (iii) Parent and Newco will make the election under \nsection 338(h)(10) in respect of the purchase of Target 6 pursuant to the \nProposed Transaction;  (iv) Target 6 and Newco will make the election under \nsection 338(h)(10) in respect of the deemed purchase of Target 6 Sub pursuant \nto the Proposed Transaction and the election discussed in clause (iii); (v) Target \n6 Sub, the common parent of a group of Business F companies filing a \nconsolidated return separate from that of Parent, is and will be an affiliated \n11 \nPLR-147933-03 \n \n \ntarget, and Target 6 is and will be a selling affiliate with respect to Target 6 Sub, \nwithin the meaning of Treas. Reg. Section 1.338(h)(10)-1(b)(3)  \n  \n(f) \nNewco is being formed prior to the closing of Step (iii) of the Proposed \nTransaction solely to permit registration of its stock and, if applicable, its \nsecurities with the Securities and Exchange Commission and to enable it to \nacquire all of the stock of the Purchased Subsidiaries at the closing of Step (iii).  \nExcept for activities incident to these actions, Newco will have no activities and \nwill carry on no business prior to Step (iii) of the Proposed Transaction.  \n \n(g) \nThe terms of the underwriting agreements pursuant to which Seller will sell the \nNewco common stock and the Newco Convertible Instrument will be determined \npursuant to arm\u2019s-length negotiations with the underwriters.  \n \n(h) \nThe fair market value of the assets of each Purchased Subsidiary will exceed its \nliabilities at the closing of Steps (iii) and (iv) of the Proposed Transaction.  \n \n(i) \nExcept for any asset described in Treas. Reg. Section 1.338-8(d)(2), neither \nNewco nor any other member of the Newco affiliated group (within the meaning \nof section 338(h)(5)) has any plan or intention to acquire from any target or from \nany direct or indirect subsidiary of any target any asset described in Treas. Reg. \nSection 1.338-8(b)(1) (after application of Treas. Reg. Section 1.338-8(b)(2)). \n \n(j) \nCurrently, Target 6 Sub is the common parent corporation of a group of Business \nF companies that are not members of the consolidated federal income tax group \nof which Parent is the common parent corporation; and Target 19 is not a \nmember of the consolidated federal income tax group of which Parent is the \ncommon parent corporation.  On the day after the completion of Step (iv) of the \nProposed Transaction, Newco, the Purchased Subsidiaries and all the \nsubsidiaries of the Purchased Subsidiaries (both the Business F companies as \nwell as the other subsidiaries) will not be members of the consolidated federal \nincome tax group of which Parent is the common parent corporation.  \n \n(k) \nThere is no plan or intention for Newco or the Purchased Subsidiaries to cease to \nremain in existence as separate corporations.  \n \n(l) \nSeller has no plan or intention to liquidate or distribute the Newco common stock \nor the Newco Convertible Instrument to Corporation 2.  \n \n(m) \nThe sales and other transfers of Newco common stock and the Newco \nConvertible Instrument described in Step (iv) and Step (vi) of the Proposed \nTransaction will not be to parties whose ownership of Newco would be attributed \n12 \nPLR-147933-03 \n \n \nto Seller pursuant to section 318. In measuring attributed ownership under \nsection 318, there shall be taken into account all events occurring or \ncontemplated during the period beginning with Step (iii) and ending with the \ncompletion of Step (vi) of the Proposed Transaction. \n \nRULINGS \n \n \nBased solely on the information submitted and on the representations set forth \nabove, we rule as follows: \n \n(1)  \nAssuming completion of Steps (ii) through (vi) of the Proposed Transaction, \nNewco\u2019s acquisition of the stock of each of the Purchased Subsidiaries from \nSeller will be a \u201cqualified stock purchase\u201d within the meaning of section 338(d)(3) \n(\u201cQSP\u201d). \n \n  \n(2) \nAssuming completion of Steps (ii) through (vi) of the Proposed Transaction, \nParent and Newco will be eligible to make the election under section 338(h)(10) \nin respect of Newco\u2019s acquisition of the stock of each of the domestic Purchased \nSubsidiaries, except Target 19, from Seller. \n \n(3) \nAssuming completion of Steps (ii) through (vi) of the Proposed Transaction, \nSeller and Newco will be eligible to make the election under section 338(h)(10) in \nrespect of Newco\u2019s acquisition of the stock of Target 19 from Seller. \n \n(4) \nAssuming completion of Steps (ii) through (vi) of the Proposed Transaction:  \n(i) \nUpon Parent and Newco making the election under section 338(h)(10) in \nrespect of Newco\u2019s acquisition of the stock of Target 6 pursuant to the \nProposed Transaction, Target 6 and Newco will be eligible to make the \nelection under section 338(h)(10) in respect of the deemed purchase of \nthe stock of Target 6 Sub.  \n \n(ii) \nUpon Target 6 and Newco making the election under section 338(h)(10) in \nrespect of the deemed purchase of the stock of Target 6 Sub pursuant to \nthe Proposed Transaction and the election described in the preceding \nclause (i) in respect of the deemed purchase of the stock of Target 6 Sub, \nTarget 6 Sub and Newco will be eligible to make the election under \nsection 338(h)(10) in respect of each deemed purchase of the stock of any \nmember (other than Target 6 Sub) of the consolidated group of which \nTarget 6 Sub is the common parent.  \n \n13 \nPLR-147933-03 \n \n \n \nCAVEAT \n \n \nExcept as expressly ruled herein, no opinion is expressed regarding the \nconsequences resulting from the section 338 election.  Moreover, no opinion is \nexpressed concerning the tax treatment of the Proposed Transaction under other \nprovisions of the Code and regulations.   Because you have not yet determined in \nrespect of which lower-tier subsidiaries of Seller (other than Target 6 Sub) you intend to \nmake elections under section 338, you have not requested rulings, and we have not \nruled, on whether elections can be made for such lower-tier subsidiaries (other than \nTarget 6 Sub and its subsidiaries), and no inference should be drawn from our failure to \nrule in that regard.  \n \nFurthermore, the effectiveness of this ruling is conditioned upon Parent, Newco, \nTarget 19, and Target 6 Sub agreeing, if requested, to an extension of their respective \nstatutes of limitations with respect to any issues raised by this letter ruling provided the \nextension is for a period acceptable to the Service.  \n \nPROCEDURAL STATEMENTS \n \nThe rulings contained in this letter are based upon information and \nrepresentations submitted by the taxpayer and accompanied by a penalty of perjury \nstatement executed by an appropriate party.  While this office has not verified any of the \nmaterial submitted in support of the request for rulings, it is subject to verification on \nexamination. \n  \nThis ruling is directed only to the taxpayer(s) requesting it.

Your request relates to whether the City is required to file \ninformation returns for payments made under the Program described below.   \n  \nBACKGROUND \n \nThe City is a municipal government incorporated under the laws of State.  The City \nimplemented the Program to reduce the financial hardship that can occur when a \nproperty owner is ordered to remove dead or dying trees, which are identified by the \nCity as posing an immediate threat to public health and safety.   \n \nThe Program has two different systems of assistance: one for owner-occupants \n(hereinafter \u201cResidents\u201d) and one for investors of rental property (hereinafter \n\u201cInvestors\u201d).  Under the Program, the City classifies dead or dying trees and issues a \nremoval order.  Residents must submit proof of ownership of the property and total \nhousehold income to the City in order to obtain assistance.  Investors must submit proof \nof ownership of the property and total household income of their tenants.  Subsequently, \nResidents and Investors solicit bids from contractors to remove the trees, and the City \n \nPLR-112851-04 \n \n \n \n2 \nselects a contractor among the solicited bids.  Upon inspection of the completed work, \nthe City makes payment directly to the contractor.  The amount of assistance is \ndetermined by the total household income level of the Residents or the tenants of \nInvestors.     \n \nPayments made to Residents are grants, while in the case of payments made to \nInvestors, the City imposes a lien on the rental property for some or all of the amount of \nassistance provided.  When the Investor sells or changes the title of the property, the \nassistance is repaid and the lien is removed.       \n      \nLAW AND ANALYSIS \n \nSection 6041 of the Internal Revenue Code (hereinafter the \u201cCode\u201d) requires all persons \nengaged in a trade or business and making payment in the course of such trade or \nbusiness to another person, of rent, salaries, wages, premiums, annuities, \ncompensations, remunerations, emoluments, or other fixed or determinable gains, \nprofits, and income of $600 or more in any taxable year, to file an information return with \nthe Internal Revenue Service (hereinafter the \u201cService\u201d) and to furnish an information \nstatement to the payee. \n \nSection 1.6041-1(c) of the Income Tax Regulations (hereinafter the \u201cRegulations\u201d) \nprovides that payments are fixed when they are paid in amounts definitely \npredetermined.  Income is determinable whenever there is a basis of calculation by \nwhich the amount to be paid may be ascertained.  Section 1.6041-1(a)(2) requires a \npayor to report section 6041 amounts on Form 1099.  Payments that are not fixed or \ndeterminable are not subject to information reporting under section 6041.   \n \nThe payments of compensation (and other amounts) required to be reported under \nsection 6041 are those includible in gross income under section 61.  Accordingly, in \norder to decide whether the City is required to furnish an information return to the \nproperty owners, it is necessary to examine whether the payments are includible in \ngross income.        \n \nSection 61(a) of the Code and the Regulations thereunder define gross income to mean \nall income from whatever source derived.  See also section 1.61 -1(a) of the \nRegulations.  However, section 1.61-6(b) provides that certain gains or losses realized \non the sale or exchange of property, including involuntary conversions under section \n1033, are not \u201crecognized,\u201d or included in gross income, at the time of the transaction.  \nThe gain or loss from such sale or exchange is generally recognized at some later date.   \n   \nSection 1033(a)(1) provides that if property (as a result of its destruction in whole or in \npart, theft, seizure, or requisition or condemnation or threat or imminence thereof) is \ncompulsorily or involuntarily converted into property similar or related in service or use \n \nPLR-112851-04 \n \n \n \n3 \nto the property so converted, no gain shall be recognized.  Section 1033(a)(2)(A) \nprovides, in part, that if such property is converted into money and the taxpayer timely \npurchases other property similar or related in service or use to the property so \nconverted, then, at the election of the taxpayer, the gain shall be recognized only to the \nextent that the amount realized on such conversion exceeds the cost of such other \nproperty. \n \nSection 1033 requires a broad construction to effectuate its purposes.  See E.R. \nHitchcock Co. v. U.S., 514 F.2d 484, 486 (2nd Cir. 1975); Loco Realty Co. v. \nCommissioner, 306 F.2d 207, 215 (8th Cir. 1962).  Amounts realized from an involuntary \nconversion have been held to include severance damages (damages to property \nremaining after condemnation) and moving expenses.  E.R. Hitchcock Co., 514 F.2d at \n486-87.        \n \nIn this case, the property owners received the costs of the tree removal services solely \nas a result of the City\u2019s order to remove the dead or dying trees.  But for the conversion, \nthe property owners would not have realized the payments from the City.  Accordingly, \nwe conclude that the payments are amounts realized from an involuntary conversion \nwithin the meaning of section 1033.   \n \nAs explained above, gains, profits, and income under section 6041 are reportable to the \nextent that they are fixed and determinable at the time the payment is made.  See \nsection 6041(a) of the Code.  When section 1033 applies, the extent to which gain must \nbe recognized in the year of disposition is contingent on the section 1033 election.  \nTaxpayers can make this election up to two years after the year in which the any portion \nof the gain is realized.  Because the City does not posses the information necessary to \ndetermine what portion, if any, of the assistance payments are income to the property \nowners, the payments are not fixed or determinable under section 6041, and the City is \nnot required to file information returns with the Service or to furnish information \nstatements to the property owners with respect to the payments.  We express no \nopinion regarding whether all or any portion of the payments would be excluded from \ngross income in the year of receipt, without regard to section 1033.     \n \nThe City\u2019s direct payments to contractors raise an additional issue.  Section 1.6041-1(e) \n(the \u201cMiddleman Rules\u201d) of the Regulations provides:  \n \n(e) Payment made on behalf of another person--(1) In general. A person \nthat makes a payment in the course of its trade or business on behalf of \nanother person is the payor that must make a return of information under \nthis section with respect to that payment if the payment is described in \nparagraph (a) of this section and, under all the facts and circumstances, \nthat person\u2014 \n \nPLR-112851-04 \n \n \n \n4 \n \n(i) Performs management or oversight functions in connection with \nthe payment (this would exclude, for example, a person who \nperforms mere administrative or ministerial functions such as \nwriting checks at another's direction); or  \n \n(ii) Has a significant economic interest in the payment (i.e., an \neconomic interest that would be compromised if the payment were \nnot made, such as by creation of a mechanic's lien on property to \nwhich the payment relates, or a loss of collateral). \nUnder the facts provided, it appears that the City exercises management or \noversight functions with respect to payments made to contractors on behalf of the \nproperty owners.  The City selects a contractor and inspects the work performed \nby the contractor prior to making payment.  See section 1.6041-1(e)(5) of the \nRegulations. \n \nAccordingly, if the City makes a direct payment to a contractor pursuant to the Program, \nthe City is required to file an information return with the Service and to furnish an \ninformation statement to the contractor.  Payments to contractors would be reported on \nForm 1099-MISC, with the amount reported in box 7 as \u201cNonemployee Compensation.\u201d   \n \nCONCLUSION \n \nFor these reasons, we conclude that the City is not subject to the information reporting \nrequirements of section 6041 with respect to the payments distributed to the property \nowners under the Program but that information reporting is required with respect to \ndirect payments to contractors, unless the recipient is a corporation or other specified \nentity, payment to which is exempt under section 1.6041-3(p) of the Regulations.   \n \nThis document may not be used or cited as precedent.

Under the provisions of the Family Trust, upon the\ndeath of Decedent, specific pecuniary bequests were to be made outright to certain\nnamed relatives of Decedent from the Husband Separate Property Trust.  The\n2\nPLR-157380-02\nremaining assets of the Family Trust were then to be divided into three separate trusts:\nTrust A, Trust B, and Trust C. \n Under Section 3.02 of the Family Trust Declaration, Trust A was to be funded\nwith the surviving spouse\u2019s one-half interest in the couple\u2019s community property as well\nas her separate property.  Under Section 3.03, Trust B was to be funded with the\n\u201cMarital Deduction Amount,\u201d which was to \u201cconsist of the smallest fractional share of the\nTrust Estate that, if added to the total value for federal estate tax purposes of all other\ninterests in property that pass or have passed from the Deceased Trustor to or in trust\nfor the Surviving Trustor and if includible in the Deceased Trustor\u2019s gross estate for\nfederal estate tax purposes and qualified for the marital deduction, will entirely eliminate\n(or reduce to the maximum possible extent) any federal estate tax at the death of the\nDeceased Trustor....\u201d  Under Section 3.04, Trust C was to be funded with the\n\u201cExemption Equivalent Amount,\u201d and \u201cconsist of all [Family Trust] property which is not\nallocated or allocable to Trust A pursuant to Section 3.02 of this Declaration, and is not\nallocated or allocable to Trust B pursuant to Section 3.03 of this Declaration.\u201d\nDecedent\u2019s estate tax return, Form 706, was timely filed.  On Schedule M of the\nestate tax return a QTIP election was made for the \u201cResidue of Decedent\u2019s interest in\nthe [Family Trust]\u201d in the amount of $x.  An estate tax liability of $y was reported and\npaid.  It was subsequently discovered that the value of the property for which the QTIP\nelection was made had been calculated incorrectly, and that if the amount of the\ndeduction had been calculated and reported correctly, no estate tax liability would have\nbeen incurred.  Decedent\u2019s estate tax return was filed in Date 2, and the statute of\nlimitations on assessment will expire in Date 3.\nThe trustee of the Family Trust, who is also the personal representative of\nDecedent\u2019s estate, requests a ruling on the validity of the QTIP election made on\nDecedent\u2019s estate tax return for the value of the interest passing to Trust B pursuant to\nthe terms of the Family Trust Declaration.  \nSection 2001(a) imposes a tax on the transfer of the taxable estate of every\ndecedent who is a citizen or resident of the United States.\nSection 2056(a) provides that, except as limited by \u00a7 2056(b), the value of the\ntaxable estate is to be determined by deducting from the value of the gross estate an\namount equal to the value of any interest in property that passes or has passed from\nthe decedent to the surviving spouse, but only to the extent that such interest is\nincluded in determining the value of the gross estate.  Section 2056(b)(1) denies a\nmarital deduction for an interest passing to the surviving spouse that is a \u201cterminable\ninterest.\u201d  An interest is a terminable interest if the interest passing to the surviving\nspouse will terminate or fail on the lapse of time or on the occurrence of an event or\ncontingency or on the failure of an event or contingency to occur and, on termination,\nan interest in the property passes to someone other than the surviving spouse.\n3\nPLR-157380-02\nSection 2056(b)(7) provides an exception to this terminable interest rule in the\ncase of qualified terminable interest property (QTIP).  For purposes of \u00a7 2056(a),\nqualified terminable interest property is treated as passing to the surviving spouse, and\nno part of the property is treated as passing to any person other than the surviving\nspouse.  Under \u00a7 2056(b)(7)(B)(i), qualified terminable interest property is property\nwhich passes from the decedent, in which the surviving spouse has a qualifying income\ninterest for life, and to which an election under \u00a7 2056(b)(7)(B)(v) applies.\nSection 2056(b)(7)(B)(v) provides that the election to treat property as QTIP\nunder \u00a7 2056(b)(7) is made by the executor on the return of tax imposed by \u00a7 2001. \nThe election, once made, is irrevocable.\nSection 20.2056(b)-7(b)(4)(i) of the Estate Tax Regulations provides that the\nterm \u201creturn of tax imposed by \u00a7 2001\u201d means the last estate tax return filed by the\nexecutor on or before the due date of the return, including extensions or, if a timely\nreturn is not filed, the first estate tax return filed by the executor after the due date.\nSection 20.2056(b)-7(b)(4)(ii) provides that an election may be revoked or\nmodified on a subsequent return filed on or before the due date of the return, including\nextensions actually granted.  If an executor appointed under local laws has made an\nelection on the return of tax imposed by \u00a7 2001 with respect to one or more properties,\nno subsequent election may be made with respect to other properties included in the\ngross estate after the return of tax imposed by \u00a7 2001 is filed.\nRev. Proc. 2001-38, 2001-24 I.R.B. 1335, applies to elections under \u00a7 2056(b)(7)\nto treat property as qualified terminable interest property in situations where the election\nis not necessary to reduce the estate tax liability to zero, based on values as finally\ndetermined for federal estate tax purposes.  The revenue procedure describes the\ncircumstances in which such an election will be treated as a nullity for federal estate,\ngift, and generation-skipping transfer tax purposes.  One example of an unnecessary\nQTIP election is an election made when the taxable estate (before allowance of the\nmarital deduction) is less than the applicable exclusion amount under \u00a7 2010(c).  The\nQTIP election is not necessary, because no estate tax would be imposed whether or\nnot the election is made.  Another example of an unnecessary QTIP election is one that\nis made for both a credit shelter trust and a marital trust.  The QTIP election for the\ncredit shelter trust is not necessary, because no estate tax is imposed on a credit\nshelter trust funded with an amount that does not exceed the applicable exclusion\namount under \u00a7 2010(c).  \nIn the instant case, a QTIP election under \u00a7 2056(b)(7)(B)(v) was made on\nDecedent\u2019s timely filed estate tax return.  The property for which the election was made\nwas described as the \u201cResidue of Decedent\u2019s interest in the [Family Trust].\u201d  The\nresidue of Decedent\u2019s interest in the Family Trust consisted of the assets remaining in\n4\nPLR-157380-02\nthe Husband\u2019s Separate Property Trust after the distribution of the specific pecuniary\nbequests plus Decedent\u2019s one-half share of the assets of the Community Property\nTrust.  However, under Sections 3.03 and 3.04 of the Family Trust Declaration, these\nassets were to be distributed to Trust B, which was to be funded with the \u201cMarital\nDeduction Amount,\u201d and Trust C, which was to be funded with the \u201cExemption\nEquivalent Amount.\u201d  Therefore, the QTIP election was made for both the QTIP trust\nand the credit shelter trust.  Pursuant to Rev. Proc. 2001-38, the QTIP election with\nrespect to Trust C, the credit shelter trust,  will be treated as a nullity for federal estate,\ngift, and generation-skipping transfer tax purposes.  However, since Trust B meets the\nrequirements for qualified terminable interest property and the election under\n\u00a7 2056(b)(7)(B)(v) was made on a timely filed estate tax return, the QTIP election for\nthe property passing to Trust B, the marital trust, is valid and irrevocable.\nAs a result of a miscalculation, the value of the property which passed to Trust B\nunder the provisions of Section 3.03 of the Family Trust Declaration was reported\nincorrectly on Schedule M of Decedent\u2019s estate tax return.  As a result of this\nmiscalculation, the marital deduction claimed for Trust B was less than the amount that\nshould have been claimed, resulting in an estate tax liability.  \nBased on the facts submitted and the representations made, we conclude that\nthe description of the QTIP property on Schedule M does not invalidate the QTIP\nelection for the property passing to Trust B pursuant to Section 3.03 of the Family Trust\nDeclaration.  Similarly, we conclude that the miscalculation of the value of the property\npassing to Trust B under the provisions of Section 3.03 does not preclude a marital\ndeduction for the full value of the property which will actually fund Trust B under the\nterms of the governing instrument.\nAccordingly, the personal representative of Decedent\u2019s estate should file a\nsupplemental Form 706  with the Internal Revenue Service Center, Cincinnati, Ohio\n45999, prior to the time prescribed by \u00a7 6511 for claiming a credit or refund.  The\nsupplemental Form 706 should supply the correct description of the trust for which the\nQTIP election was made and report the full value of the property subject to the QTIP\nelection.  A copy of this letter should be attached to the supplemental return.  A copy is\nenclosed for that purpose.\nThe ruling contained in this letter is based upon information and representations\nsubmitted by the taxpayer and accompanied by a penalty of perjury statement executed\nby an appropriate party.  While this office has not verified any of the material submitted\nin support of the request for ruling, it is subject to verification on examination.\nExcept as specifically ruled herein, we express or imply no opinion on the federal\ntax consequences of the transaction under the cited provisions or under any other\nprovisions of the Code.  In addition, we express or imply no opinion regarding the value\nof the property transferred to the trusts. \n5\nPLR-157380-02\nThis ruling is directed only to the taxpayer requesting it.  Section 6110(k)(3)\nprovides that it may not be used or cited as precedent.\nIn accordance with the Power of Attorney on file with this office, a copy of this\nletter is being sent to the taxpayer.\nSincerely,\nKatherine A.

Y, a wholly owned subsidiary of X, is a life \ninsurance and annuity company that provides a variety of life insurance products, \nannuities, and other investment products to individuals and businesses in all 50 states \nand the District of Columbia. \n \n \nPLR-132793-06 \n \n \n2 \nTrust is an open-end management investment company organized under the laws of \nState.  The beneficial interests in Trust\u2019s property consist of transferable shares \n(Shares) in multiple segregated portfolios of assets, including portfolio Z, each with \nseparate investments.  The portfolios support X\u2019s and Y\u2019s variable contracts.  Shares of \nthe portfolios may only be purchased by domestic life insurance companies, either \ndirectly or through separate accounts of such companies.  X has nine separate \naccounts and Y has four separate accounts.    Premiums received by X and Y are \nallocated to their respective separate accounts.  Collectively, the accounts of X and Y \nown all of the Shares of the portfolios and have the right to purchase additional shares \nor have shares redeemed at any time. \n \nContract holders may specify in which separate account the premium is to be invested.  \nThe benefits X and Y pay to the contract holder are determined by reference to the \ninvestment return associated with, and the market value of, the relevant portfolio \nsupporting the variable contract.  However, the benefits under the variable contracts can \nvary significantly from the value of the Shares in the portfolios, especially where a \ncontract holder dies before his or her life expectancy.  The contract holder is typically \nentitled to a minimum payment, regardless of the portfolio\u2019s performance.  Typically, a \nvariable contract cannot be redeemed, within a specified period, without a penalty, nor \nsold at face value.  Furthermore, the Shares in the portfolios are owned by the \ninsurance company issuing the variable contract for federal income tax purposes.  The \ncontract holder only has claims against the insurance company issuing the variable \ncontract and not against the income, gains, losses, or distributions of the portfolios.  \nEach portfolio is currently a regulated investment company (RIC) within the meaning of \n\u00a7 851.   \n \nZ proposes to elect to be treated as a partnership.  Z requests a ruling that it will be \nclassified as a partnership and not a publicly traded partnership. \n \nX and Y make the following representations: \n1.  Trust is a business trust that has never held itself out to be a state law corporation.  \nEach portfolio is currently a separate RIC as defined in \u00a7 851(a). \n2.  Z will have at least two members, X and Y, investing through their separate \naccounts, and will elect to be treated as a partnership for federal tax purposes. \n3.  If Shares are sold to other insurance companies, the Shares will not be held by more \nthan 100 domestic life insurance companies. \n4.  If Shares are sold to other insurance companies, the Shares will only be issued to \nseparate accounts of domestic life insurance companies. \n5.  X and Y are and will be treated as the owners of the Shares in the portfolios for \nfederal income tax purposes.  \n6.  The assets of the separate accounts will be adequately diversified within the \nmeaning of \u00a7 817(h) and \u00a7 1.817-5(b) of the Income Tax Regulations. \n7.  Allocations of taxable income, gain, loss, deductions, and credits of the portfolios will \nbe made in accordance with \u00a7\u00a7 704(b) and (c), and except as required by \u00a7 704(c), \n \nPLR-132793-06 \n \n \n3 \neach holder of a Share will be allocated its share of each portfolio\u2019s income or loss \nwhich will be composed of a proportionate share of each item of the portfolio\u2019s income \nor loss. \n8.  Public access to Z is only available through the purchase of a variable contract. \n9.  The Shares are not and will not be traded on an established securities market. \n10.  The Shares are not and will not be regularly quoted by any person, such as a \nbroker or dealer, making a market in the shares. \n11.  No person regularly makes available, and will not make available, to the public \n(including customers or subscribers) bid or offer quotes with respect to the Shares or \nstands ready, or will stand ready, to effect buy or sell transactions at the quoted prices \nfor itself or on behalf of others. \n12.  No holder of Shares has, or will have, a readily available, regular, and ongoing \nopportunity to sell or exchange the Shares through a public means of obtaining or \nproviding information of offers to buy, sell, or exchange Shares. \n13.  There is no plan or intention for the redemption of Shares by Z to be combined with \nthe issuance of Shares in Z to a new partner. \n \nPartnership Ruling \n \nSection 301.7701-3(a) provides that a business entity that is not classified as a \ncorporation under \u00a7 301.7701-2(b)(1), (3), (4), (5), (6), (7), or (8) (an eligible entity) can \nelect its classification for federal tax purposes. \n \nSection 301.7701-3(b)(1)(i) provides that, unless it elects otherwise, a domestic eligible \nentity is classified as a partnership if it has two or more members. \n \nX and Y represent that Z will have at least two members and will elect pursuant to \n\u00a7 301.7701-3 to be classified as a partnership.  Provided Z has 2 or more members and \nmakes the entity classification election to be classified as a partnership, Z will be \nproperly classified as a partnership for federal tax purposes. \n \nPublicly Traded Partnership Ruling \n \nSection 7704(a) provides that except as provided in \u00a7 7704(c), a publicly traded \npartnership will be treated as a corporation. \n \nSection 7704(b) provides that the term \u201cpublicly traded partnership\u201d means any \npartnership if (1) interests in such partnership are traded on an established securities \nmarket and (2) interests in such partnership are readily tradable on a secondary market \n(or the substantial equivalent thereof). \n \nSection 1.7704-1(a)(2)(i) provides that for purposes of \u00a7 7704(b) and \u00a7 1.7704-1, an \ninterest in a partnership includes (A) any interest in the capital or profits of the \npartnership (including the right to partnership distributions); and (B) any financial \n \nPLR-132793-06 \n \n \n4 \ninstrument or contract the value of which is determined in whole or in part by reference \nto the partnership (including the amount of partnership distributions, the value of \npartnership assets, or the results of partnership operations). \n \nSection 1.7704-1(a)(3) provides that for purposes of \u00a7 7704(b) and \u00a7 1.7704-1, a \ntransfer of an interest in a partnership means a transfer in any form, including a \nredemption by the partnership or the entering into of a financial instrument or contract \ndescribed in \u00a7 1.7704-1(a)(2)(i)(B). \n \nSection 1.7704-1(c)(1) provides that for purposes of \u00a7 7704(b) and \u00a7 1.7704-1, interests \nin a partnership that are not traded on an established securities market (within the \nmeaning of \u00a7 7704(b) and \u00a7 1.7704-1(b)) are readily tradable on a secondary market or \nthe substantial equivalent thereof if, taking into account all of the facts and \ncircumstances, the partners are readily able to buy, sell, or exchange their partnership \ninterests in a manner that is comparable, economically, to trading on an established \nsecurities market. \n \nSection 1.7704-1(c)(2) provides that for purposes of \u00a7 1.7704-1(c)(1), interests in a \npartnership are readily tradable on a secondary market or the substantial equivalent \nthereof if (i) interests in the partnership are regularly quoted by any person, such as a \nbroker or dealer, making a market in the interests; (ii) any person regularly makes \navailable to the public (including customers or subscribers) bid or offer quotes with \nrespect to interests in the partnership and stands ready to effect buy or sell transactions \nat the quoted prices for itself or on behalf of others; (iii) the holder of an interest in the \npartnership has a readily available, regular, and ongoing opportunity to sell or exchange \nthe interest through a public means of obtaining or providing information of offers to buy, \nsell, or exchange interests in the partnership; or (iv) prospective buyers and sellers \notherwise have the opportunity to buy, sell, or exchange interests in the partnership in a \ntime frame and with the regularity and continuity that is comparable to that described in \nthe other provisions of \u00a7 1.7704-1(c)(2). \n \nSection 1.7704-1(d) provides that for purposes of \u00a7 7704(b) and \u00a7 1.7704-1, interests in \na partnership are not traded on an established securities market within the meaning of \n\u00a7 1.7704-1(b)(5) and are not readily tradable on a secondary market or the substantial \nequivalent thereof within the meaning of \u00a7 1.7704-1(c) (even if interests in the \npartnership are traded or readily tradable in a manner described in \u00a7 1.7704-1(b)(5) or \n(c)) unless (1) the partnership participates in the establishment of the market or the \ninclusion of its interests thereon; or (2) the partnership recognizes any transfers made \non the market by (i) redeeming the transferor partner (in the case of a redemption or \nrepurchase by the partnership); or (ii) admitting the transferee as a partner or otherwise \nrecognizing any rights of the transferee, such as a right of the transferee to receive \npartnership distributions (directly or indirectly) or to acquire an interest in the capital or \nprofits of the partnership. \n \nPLR-132793-06 \n \n \n5 \n \nThe Shares sold by X to the segregated asset accounts of other insurance companies \nare interests in the capital or profits of the portfolios.  Therefore, the Shares are \npartnership interests for purposes of \u00a7 7704(b).  See \u00a7 1.7704-1(a)(2)(i)(A).  The sale of \nShares to the segregated asset accounts of other insurance companies does not fall \nwithin the definition of trading on an established securities market as defined in  \n\u00a7 7704(b)(1) and \u00a7 1.7704-1(b).  Additionally, Shares may only be sold to the \nsegregated asset accounts of other insurance companies and (i) are not regularly \nquoted by any person, such as a broker or dealer, making a market in the interests; (ii) \nno person regularly makes available to the public (including customers or subscribers) \nbid or offer quotes with respect to the Shares and stands ready to effect buy or sell \ntransactions at the quoted prices for itself or on behalf of others; (iii) the Unit holder \ndoes not have a readily available, regular, and ongoing opportunity to sell or exchange \nthe interest through a public means of obtaining or providing information of offers to buy, \nsell, or exchange interests in the partnership; or (iv) prospective buyers and sellers do \nnot otherwise have the opportunity to buy, sell, or exchange Shares in a time frame and \nwith the regularity and continuity that is comparable to that described in the other \nprovisions of \u00a7 1.7704-1(c)(2). \n \nThe shares are not traded on an established securities market and the Shares are not \nreadily tradable on a secondary market (or substantial equivalent thereof).  Therefore, \nbased solely on the information submitted and the representations made, we conclude \nthat after Z elects to be classified as a partnership, Z will not be a publicly traded \npartnership. \n \nExcept as specifically set forth above, no opinion is expressed or implied concerning the \nfederal tax consequences of the facts described above under any other provision of the \nCode. \n \nThis ruling is directed only to the taxpayer who requested it.

X anticipates\nmaking an election to be treated as an S corporation on D1.\nX is in the business of owning, renting, and managing the\n                     \n-2-\nProperties.  The Properties are commercial retail stores and\noffices located in City.  X, directly and through contractors,\nprovides various services in operating the Properties.  Services\nprovided in the last year include the following: security for\ntenants and tourists; maintenance of the Properties\u2019 exterior\nwalls, roofs, heating, electricity, and plumbing; gardening and\nlandscaping; maintenance of the sidewalk, curbing and trash\nremoval; and 24 hour emergency repair service.  \nIn addition to the services provided to tenants, X handles\nthe usual marketing, leasing, and administrative functions\ninvolved in managing real estate including posting \"For Rent\"\nsigns in vacant store windows, negotiating and preparing tenant\nleases, directly leasing its Properties to tenants, collecting\nrents from its tenants, paying all of the Properties operating\nexpanses, and obtaining insurance coverage.  \nIn the fiscal year ending D2, X received approximately $x in\nrents and paid approximately $y in relevant expenses. \nSection 1361(a)(1) defines an \"S corporation\" as a small\nbusiness corporation for which an election under \u00a7 1362(a) is in\neffect for the taxable year. \nSection 1362(d)(3)(A) provides that an election under      \n\u00a7 1362(a) shall be terminated whenever the corporation has\naccumulated earnings and profits at the close of each of 3\nconsecutive taxable years, and has gross receipts for each of\nsuch taxable years more than 25 percent of which are passive\ninvestment income.\nSection 1362(d)(3)(C)(i) provides that except as otherwise\nprovided, the term \"passive investment income\" means gross\nreceipts derived from royalties, rents, dividends, interest,\nannuities, and sales or exchanges of stock or securities. \nSection 1.1362-2(c)(5)(ii)(B)(1) of the Income Tax\nRegulations defines \"rents\" as amounts received for the use of,\nor right to use, property (whether real or personal) of the\ncorporation. \nSection 1.1362-2(c)(5)(ii)(B)(2) provides that \"rents\" does\nnot include rents derived in the active trade or business of\nrenting property. Rents received by a corporation are derived in\nan active trade or business of renting property only if, based on\nall the facts and circumstances, the corporation provides\nsignificant services or incurs substantial costs in the rental\nbusiness. Generally, significant services are not rendered and\nsubstantial costs are not incurred in connection with net leases.\nWhether significant services are performed or substantial costs\n                     \n-3-\nare incurred in the rental business is determined based upon all\nthe facts and circumstances including, but not limited to, the\nnumber of persons employed to provide the services and the types\nand amounts of costs and expenses incurred (other than\ndepreciation). \nBased solely on the facts and the representations submitted,\nwe conclude that the rental income that X derives from Properties\nis income from the active trade or business of renting property\nand is not passive investment income as described in            \n\u00a7 1362(d)(3)(C)(i). \nExcept as specifically set forth above, we express no\nopinion as to the federal tax consequences of the transaction\ndescribed above under any other provision of the Code.  Further,\nwe express no opinion on whether X is a small business\ncorporation eligible to make an S election under \u00a7 1361(b)(3) of\nthe Code. \nThis ruling is directed only to the taxpayer requesting it. \nSection 6110(k)(3) of the Code provides that it may not be used\nor cited as precedent.\nIn accordance with the power of attorney on file with this\noffice, a copy of this letter is being sent to X\u2019s authorized\nrepresentative.\nSincerely yours,\nJ.
