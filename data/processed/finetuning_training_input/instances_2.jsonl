Taxpayer is a wholly-owned subsidiary of A and joins in the consolidated \nFederal income tax return filed for the affiliated group headed by A.  A files its \nconsolidated Federal income tax return on a calendar year basis.\nPLR-132858-12\n2\nTaxpayer owns certain improved real property located at Taxpayer\u2019s B plant in \nCity1, State1 (the \u201cB property\u201d).  The B property contains certain depreciable real \nproperty that is section 1250 property.  Most of this section 1250 property has been fully \ndepreciated.  Hereinafter, the fully depreciated B property that is section 1250 property \nwill be referred to as \u201cthe Property.\u201d\nTaxpayer intends to contribute some or all of the Property to one or more \norganizations that are exempt from Federal income tax under section 501(c)(3) as a \ncharitable contribution under section 170.  Moreover, Taxpayer intends to claim a \ncharitable deduction under section 170 with respect to its contribution of the Property to \none or more section 501(c)(3) tax-exempt organizations.\nTaxpayer represents that these section 501(c)(3) tax-exempt organizations will \nhave the same basis in the Property as Taxpayer will have at the time of the transfer \npursuant to section 1015(a).\nRULING REQUESTED\nTaxpayer requests the following ruling:\nIf the Property is contributed to one or more section 501(c)(3) tax-exempt \norganizations, the charitable deduction attributable to the value of the \ncontribution will not be reduced by twenty percent of the accumulated \ndepreciation of the Property pursuant to section 291(a)(1).\nLAW AND ANALYSIS\nSection 170 generally allows a deduction, subject to certain limitations, for \ncharitable contributions made during the taxable year to or for the use of organizations \ndescribed in section 170(c), including section 501(c)(3) organizations.\nSection 170A-1(c)(1) of the Income Tax Regulations provides that if a charitable \ncontribution is made in property other than money, the amount of the contribution is the \nfair market value of the property at the time of the contribution, reduced as provided in \nsection 170(e)(1) and section 1.170A-4(a), or section 170(e)(3) and section 1.170A-\n4A(c).\nSection 170(e)(1) provides that the amount of any charitable contribution of \nproperty otherwise taken into account under section 170 shall be reduced by, among \nother amounts, the amount of gain that would not have been long-term capital gain \n(determined without regard to section 1221(b)(3)) if the property contributed had been\nsold by the taxpayer at its fair market value (determined at the time of such \ncontribution).\nPLR-132858-12\n3\nSection 1.170A-4(a)(1) provides that in the case of a contribution by an individual \nor by a corporation of ordinary income property, as defined in section 1.170A-4(b)(1), \nthe amount of the charitable contribution that would be taken into account under section \n170(a) without regard to section 170(e) shall be reduced before applying the percentage \nlimitations under section 170(b) by the amount of gain that would have been recognized \nas gain that is not long-term capital gain if the property had been sold by the donor at its \nfair market value at the time of its contribution to the charitable organization.\nSection 1.170A-4(b)(1) defines the term \u201cordinary income property\u201d as meaning \nproperty any portion of the gain on which would not have been long-term capital gain if \nthe property had been sold by the donor at its fair market value at the time of its \ncontribution to the charitable organization.\nSection 291(a)(1) provides that in a case where a corporation disposes of section \n1250 property, an amount equal to twenty percent of the excess, if any, of (A) the \namount that would be treated as ordinary income if such property was section 1245 \nproperty, over (B) the amount treated as ordinary income under section 1250 \n(determined without regard to section 291(a)(1)), shall be treated as gain which is \nordinary income under section 1250 and shall be recognized notwithstanding any other \nprovision of Subtitle A of the Code.  Section 291(a)(1) further provides that under \nregulations prescribed by the Secretary, the provisions of section 291(a)(1) will not \napply to the disposition of any property to the extent that section 1250(a) does not apply \nto such disposition by reason of section 1250(d).\nIf section 1245 property is disposed of, section 1245(a)(1) generally provides that \nthe amount by which the lower of (A) the recomputed basis of the property, or (B) the \namount realized (in the case of a sale, exchange, or involuntary conversion) or the fair \nmarket value of such property (in the case of any other disposition), exceeds the \nadjusted basis of such property is treated as ordinary income.  Such gain is recognized \nnotwithstanding any other provision of Subtitle A of the Code.\nSection 1245(a)(2) defines the term \u201crecomputed basis\u201d with respect to any \nproperty as meaning, generally, its adjusted basis recomputed by adding thereto all \nadjustments reflected in such adjusted basis on account of deductions (whether in \nrespect of the same or other property) allowed or allowable to the taxpayer or to any \nother person for depreciation or amortization.   \nIf section 1250 property is disposed of after December 31, 1975, section \n1250(a)(1)(A) generally provides that 100 percent of the lower of (i) that portion of the \nadditional depreciation attributable to periods after December 31, 1975, in respect of \nsuch property, or (ii) the excess of the amount realized (in the case of a sale, exchange, \nor involuntary conversion), or the fair market value of such property (in the case of any \nother disposition), over the adjusted basis of such property, is treated as gain that is \nPLR-132858-12\n4\nordinary income.  Such gain is recognized notwithstanding any other provision of \nSubtitle A of the Code.\nSection 1250(b)(1) defines the term \u201cadditional depreciation\u201d as meaning, in the \ncase of any property, the depreciation adjustments in respect of such property; except \nthat, in the case of property held more than one year, it means such adjustments only to \nthe extent that they exceed the amount of the depreciation adjustments that would have \nresulted if such adjustments had been determined for each taxable year under the \nstraight-line method of depreciation.\nSection 1250(d)(1) provides that section 1250(a) shall not apply to a disposition \nby gift.\nSection 1.1250-3(a)(1) provides that, for purposes of section 1250(d)(1), the term \n\u201cgift\u201d shall have the same meaning as in section 1.1245-4(a).\nSection 1.1245-4(a) provides that the term \u201cgift\u201d means, generally, a transfer of \nproperty which, in the hands of the transferee, has a basis determined under the \nprovisions of section 1015(a) or (d) (relating to basis of property acquired by gifts).\nIf section 1250 property is disposed of by gift (as defined in sections 1.1250-\n3(a)(1) and 1.1245-4(a)), section 1250(d)(1) provides that section 1250(a) does not \napply to such disposition.  Consequently, section 291(a)(1) would not apply to a gift (as \ndefined in sections 1.1250-3(a)(1) and 1.1245-4(a)) of section 1250 property.  \nIn this case, Taxpayer represents that it intends to contribute the Property to one \nor more organizations that are section 501(c)(3) tax-exempt organizations, that this \nintended contribution will be a valid charitable contribution that meets the requirements \nof section 170, and that these section 501(c)(3) tax-exempt organizations will have a \nbasis in the Property equal to Taxpayer\u2019s basis in the Property at the time of transfer \npursuant to section 1015(a).  These are material representations.  Because the basis of \nthe Property in the hands of the section 501(c)(3) tax-exempt organizations will be the \nsame as Taxpayer\u2019s basis in the Property at the time of the transfer pursuant to section \n1015(a), the contribution of the Property by Taxpayer to the section 501(c)(3) \norganizations is a gift for purposes of sections 1250(d)(1) and 1.1250-3(a)(1).  \nAccordingly, the provisions of section 291(a)(1) will not apply to Taxpayer\u2019s disposition \nof the Property to the section 501(c)(3) tax-exempt organizations.\nCONCLUSION\nBased solely on Taxpayer\u2019s representations and the relevant law and analysis \nset forth above, we conclude that if the Property is contributed to one or more section \n501(c)(3) tax-exempt organizations, the charitable deduction attributable to the value of \nPLR-132858-12\n5\nthe contribution will not be reduced by twenty percent of the accumulated depreciation \nof the Property pursuant to section 291(a)(1).\nExcept as specifically set forth above, no opinion is expressed or implied \nconcerning the tax consequences of the facts described above under any other \nprovisions of the Code.  Specifically, this letter ruling is based upon Taxpayer\u2019s \ndescription of the proposed contribution of property to certain section 501(c)(3) \norganizations.  This letter ruling does not address whether the proposed contribution is \na valid charitable contribution that meets the requirements of section 170.  Further, the \namount of the deduction for the proposed contribution is outside the scope of this letter \nruling, and no approval of the amount should be inferred from this letter ruling.  \nMoreover, no opinion is expressed or implied on (i) whether any of the property located \nat B is section 1250 property, and (ii) the propriety of Taxpayer\u2019s methods of \ndepreciating the property located at B.\nThis letter ruling is directed only to the taxpayer requesting it.  Section 6110(k)(3) \nprovides that it may not be used or cited as precedent.\nIn accordance with the power of attorney, we are sending a copy of this letter to \nTaxpayer\u2019s authorized representatives.  We are also sending a copy of this letter to the \nappropriate operating division director.\nSincerely,\nKathleen Reed\nKathleen Reed\nChief, Branch 7\nOffice of Associate Chief Counsel\n(Income Tax and Accounting)\nEnclosures (2):\ncopy of this letter\ncopy for section 6110 purposes \n```\n\n        Provide your output as one of the two values: Adverse or Non-Adverse."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Non-Adverse"}]}

The material information submitted for consideration is \nsummarized below.  Capitalized or underlined terms not defined in this letter have the \nmeanings assigned to them in the Ruling.\nThe rulings contained in this letter are based upon information and \nrepresentations submitted by the taxpayer and are accompanied by a penalty of perjury \nstatement executed by an appropriate party.

Pursuant to X=s \nwill, the executor of the Estate will give certain bequests of cash and personal property \nto individual named beneficiaries.  Any residual estate remaining is to be divided equally \nand distributed to ten named charitable organizations, each of which is represented as \nbeing an organization described in ' 501(c)(3) (collectively, the Charities). \n \n \nPLR-137172-03 \n \n2 \nArticle VIII of X=s will grants the executor of the Estate the power to make \ndistribution or division of the Estate in cash or in kind, or both; to allot different kinds or \ndisproportionate shares of property or undivided interests in property among the \nbeneficiaries, and to determine the value of any such property; and to make such \nelections under the tax laws applicable to the Estate as the executor determines should \nbe made.  No compensating adjustments between principal and income, nor with \nrespect to any bequest or devise, shall be made even though the elections so made \nmay affect (beneficially or adversely) the interests of the beneficiaries.  \n \nAt the time of X=s death, X owned a non-qualified annuity contract (the Contract), \nwhich had a basis in X=s hands of $x and a value of $y as of D1 of Year 1.  The Contract \nwas purchased after October 21, 1979.  No payments had been received by X under \nthe Contract.  The named beneficiary of the death benefit under the Contract is the \nEstate.  The Estate surrendered the Contract on D2 of Year 1 for $z.  The difference \nbetween $y and $z represents interest accrued after the death of X.  The Estate has not \nincluded any amount in its gross income or taken any income tax deduction with respect \nto the Contract for any taxable year.  The Estate has made interim distributions \nsatisfying all specific and pecuniary bequests.  The amounts received upon surrender of \nthe Contract will be distributed as part of the remaining residuary bequest to the \nCharities, which have also received interim cash distributions.   \n \n \nThe Estate has filed its income tax returns for all taxable years on a fiscal year \nending D1, which is not the last day of any month. \n \n \nSection 441(a) provides that taxable income shall be computed on the basis of \nthe taxpayer\u2019s taxable year.  In general, an estate may adopt a calendar year or a fiscal \nyear.  Section 441(e) defines a fiscal year as a period of twelve months ending on the \nlast day of any month other than December. \n \n \nSection 642(c)(1) provides that in the case of an estate, there shall be allowed as \na deduction in computing its taxable income (in lieu of the deduction allowed by             \n\u00a7 170(a), relating to deduction for charitable, etc., contributions and gifts) any amount of \nthe gross income, without limitation, which pursuant to the terms of the governing \ninstrument is, during the taxable year, paid for a purpose specified in ' 170(c) \n(determined without regard to \u00a7 170(c)(2)(A)). \n \n \nSection 642(c)(2) provides that in the case of an estate, there shall be allowed as \na deduction in computing its taxable income any amount of the gross income, without \nlimitation, which pursuant to the terms of the governing instrument is, during the taxable \nyear, permanently set aside for a purpose specified in \u00a7 170(c), or is to be used \nexclusively for religious, charitable, scientific, literary, or educational purposes, or for the \nprevention of cruelty to children or animals, or for the establishment, acquisition, \nmaintenance, or operation of a public cemetery not operated for profit. \n \n \nPLR-137172-03 \n \n3 \nSection 691(a)(1) provides that the amount of all items of gross income in \nrespect of a decedent which are not properly includible in respect of the taxable period \nin which falls the date of the decedent=s death or a prior period (including the amount of \nall items of gross income in respect of a prior decedent, if the right to receive such \namount was acquired by reason of the death of the prior decedent or by bequest, \ndevise, or inheritance from the prior decedent) shall be included in the gross income, for \nthe taxable year when received, of: (A) the estate of the decedent, if the right to receive \nthe amount is acquired by the decedent=s estate from the decedent; (B) the person who, \nby reason of the death of the decedent, acquires the right to receive the amount, if the \nright to receive the amount is not acquired by the decedent=s estate from the decedent; \nor (C) the person who acquires from the decedent the right to receive the amount by \nbequest, devise, or inheritance, if the amount is received after a distribution by the \ndecedent=s estate of such right. \n \n \nRev. Rul. 2005-30, 2005-20 I.R.B. 1015, holds that if the owner-annuitant of a \ndeferred annuity contract dies before the annuity starting date, and the beneficiary \nreceives a death benefit under the annuity contract, the amount received by the \nbeneficiary in a lump sum in excess of the owner-annuitant\u2019s investment in the contract \nis includible in the beneficiary\u2019s gross income as IRD within the meaning of \u00a7 691.  Rev. \nRul. 2005-30 applies to deferred annuity contracts purchased on or after October 21, \n1979. \n \nBased solely on the facts and representations submitted, we conclude that the \nexcess of $y over $x received by the Estate (as the named beneficiary of the Contract) \nupon the surrender of the Contract was IRD includible by the Estate in its Year 1 gross \nincome.  The Estate is entitled to a deduction under \u00a7 642(c)(1) for the amounts of IRD \npaid to the Charities in the Year 1 taxable year, or under \u00a7 642(c)(2) for the remaining \namounts of IRD which were set aside for charitable purposes.  We further conclude that \nthe Estate has not filed its income tax returns based on an allowable taxable year under \n\u00a7 441. \n \n \nThe Estate must file amended income tax returns for all taxable years based \nupon an allowable taxable year.  Those returns, as amended, must include the IRD in \nthe Estate\u2019s gross income and claim the appropriate deduction under \u00a7 642(c).  A copy \nof this letter should be attached to each return.  \n \nExcept as specifically set forth above, no opinion is expressed concerning the \nfederal tax consequences of the transactions described above. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nPLR-137172-03 \n \n4 \n \nThis ruling is directed only to the taxpayer requesting it.

You \nrequested the following rulings concerning the tax treatment of certain escrow accounts \nrequired by and established pursuant to law:   \n \n \n(1) the escrow accounts that Company established with B pursuant to the D, are \nqualified settlement funds within the meaning of section 1.468B-1 of the Income Tax \nRegulations; \n \n \n(2) all payments made by Company to these escrow accounts are fully \ndeductible; \n \n \n(3) subsequent payments by Company made to these accounts and to other \naccounts set up with B or a similar financial institution pursuant to agreements entered \ninto with other Cs are deductible in the year deposited into escrow; \n \n \n(4) each escrow account is subject to tax on its modified gross income for any \ntaxable year at a rate equal to the maximum rate in effect for that taxable year under \nsection 1(e) of the Internal Revenue Code; and \n \n \n(5) transfers to the escrow accounts by Company will not constitute gross income \nto the accounts. \n \nA taxpayer conference of right was held on November 19, 2002.  An additional taxpayer \nconference was held on May 2, 2005. \n \nFACTS \n \n \nCompany is a public corporation engaged in the manufacture and wholesale \ndistribution of J G, a brand of G products, including F.  Company began operations in \nYear 1 as a contract manufacturer of G and F.  Company uses an accrual method of \naccounting.  Since Year 2, Company has engaged in extensive research and \ndevelopment activities relating to the development of its proprietary products utilizing its \npatented J technology. \n \n \nThe Cs brought a consolidated suit against the major manufacturers and sellers \n(manufacturers) of G products.  The suit asserted various claims for monetary, equitable \n \nPLR-124833-02 \n \n \n3 \nand injunctive relief under state laws, including consumer protection and/or antitrust \nlaws.  The Company was not a party defendant in the suit brought by the Cs against the \nmajor manufacturers of G products.  \n \n \n \nOn Date 1, the Cs entered into a settlement agreement, A, to resolve litigation \nagainst the major manufacturers of G products.  Under the A, the party defendant \nmanufacturers of G products are required to establish escrow accounts and make \nannual payments (in perpetuity) into escrow for the benefit of the Cs.  The A provides \nthat all payments are in settlement of H.  The party defendants\u2019 payments to the escrow \naccounts are determined by a formula based on their F sales.  In exchange for these \npayments, the defendant manufacturers of G products are \u201cabsolutely and \nunconditionally released and forever discharged from all claims that the Cs directly, \nindirectly, derivatively or in any other capacity ever had, now have, or hereafter can, \nshall or may have\u201d against the defendant manufacturers from liability relating to past, \npresent and certain future claims stemming from the use, sale, distribution, \nmanufacture, development, advertising, or marketing of F.  Under the A, these escrow \naccounts are expressly intended to be treated as qualified settlement funds for federal \nincome tax purposes. \n \n \nThe party defendant manufacturers believed that the manufacturers of G \nproducts not named as party defendants in litigation also contributed to the harms \nalleged by the Cs.  Consequently, the party defendant manufacturers of G products \ndemanded as a condition of the settlement that nonparty manufacturers of G products \nbe required to share the financial burdens and make deposits into escrows as well.  The \nCs agreed.  The Cs and the party defendant manufacturers structured their settlement \nto require nonparty manufacturers to contribute to the settlement in one of two ways.  In \nrelevant part, the A directs the Cs to require that certain nonparty manufacturers, of \nwhich Company is one, establish escrow accounts based on the same formula provided \nin the A.  The D was incorporated into and made an integral part of the A approved by \nthe court having jurisdiction.  Each C has enacted a law in the same or substantially \nsimilar form as the D.  \n \n \nThe objective of the D is to force nonparty manufacturers who refuse to opt into \nthe A to assume a share of the financial burdens created by the use of F and other G \nproducts.  The D applies to any nonparty manufacturer selling F within a C .  The \namount of a manufacturer\u2019s annual deposits into the escrow accounts required by the D \nare based on a manufacturer\u2019s sales of F during the year in question.  Any escrow \naccounts set up for this purpose must be approved by the Cs. \n \n \nCompany has refused to opt into the A.  Therefore, as a nonparty manufacturer \nof G products selling F within C, Company is required under the D to establish escrow \naccounts based on the same formula provided in the A.  \n \n \nPLR-124833-02 \n \n \n4 \n \n \nThe Cs have advised Company of its duty to deposit funds in accordance with  \nthe Ds and have made written demands for the deposits.  In Year 3, Company \nestablished the escrow accounts at B.  The escrow accounts at B were approved by the \nCs.  To date, Company has deposited a total of  $ X into escrow accounts in  accordance  \nwith the Ds.  As long as Company remains a manufacturer of G products, it will continue \nto be required to make annual deposits into such escrow accounts, either at B or similar \nfinancial institutions. \n \n \nOn or about Date 2, the L (one of the Cs referred to above) notified Company via \nletter of its intent to file a suit against Company in state court.  L alleges at least one \nclaim against Company asserting liability arising out of a violation of laws resulting from \nthe sale of G products and related actions.   \n \n \nCompany represents that pursuant to the Ds, it contributes to the escrow \naccounts held for the sole purpose of satisfying C (of which L is a party) claims.  The \nescrow accounts exist to satisfy C claims brought against Company within Number after \nthe date such fund is placed into escrow.  Company may not access the fund for any \npurpose other than satisfying C claims during the Number period.  Any remainder will \nrevert to Company.  Company expects that claims will be made against all the \ncontributed funds and, if successful, the funds will be used to satisfy C claims and that \nnothing will remain to revert to Company.  Company further represents that the D \nplaced Company in substantially the same economic position as the party \nmanufacturers of G products agreeing to the A.  That is, Company effectively \ncontributes funds to satisfy its ultimate liability to the Cs for damage caused by its G \nproducts.  Consequently, Company believes that it should receive the same tax \ntreatment under sections 461 and 468B of the Internal Revenue Code as the \nmanufacturers of G products agreeing to the A. \n \n \nREQUESTED RULING 1 \n \n \nEscrow Account Classification \n \n \nSection 468B(g) of the Code provides, in part, that nothing in any provision of law \nshall be construed as providing that an escrow account, settlement fund, or similar fund \nis not subject to current income tax.  Pursuant to the authority of section 468B(g), the \nSecretary has published sections 1.468B-1 through 1.468B-5 of the regulations \nregarding qualified settlement funds. \n \n \nSection 1.468B-1(a) provides that a qualified settlement fund is a fund, account, \nor trust that satisfies all three requirements of section 1.468B-1(c).  First, section \n1.468B-1(c)(1) requires that the fund, account, or trust is established pursuant to an \n \nPLR-124833-02 \n \n \n5 \norder of, or it is approved by, the United States, any state (including the District of \nColumbia), territory, possession, or political subdivision thereof, or any agency or \ninstrumentality (including a court of law) of any of the foregoing and is subject to the \ncontinued jurisdiction of that governmental authority.  Second, section 1.468B-1(c)(2) \nrequires that the fund, account, or trust is established to resolve or satisfy one or more \ncontested or uncontested claims that have resulted or may result from an event (or \nrelated series of events) that has occurred and that has given rise to at least one claim \nasserting liability (i) under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation \nand Liability Act of 1980; (ii) arising out of a tort, breach of contract, or violation of law; \nor (iii) designated by the Commissioner in a revenue ruling or revenue procedure.  \nThird, section 1.468B-1(c)(3) provides that the fund, account, or trust must be a trust \nunder applicable state law, or its assets must be otherwise segregated from other \nassets of the transferor (and related persons). \n \n \nSection 1.468B-1(j)(1) provides that if a fund, account or trust is established to \nresolve or satisfy claims described in section 1.468B-1(c)(2), the assets of the fund, \naccount, or trust are treated as owned by the transferor of those assets until the fund, \naccount, or trust also meets the requirements of sections 1.468B-1(c)(1) and (c)(3).  On \nthe date the fund, account, or trust satisfies all the requirements of section 1.468B-1(c), \nthe transferor is treated as transferring the assets to a qualified settlement fund. \n \n \nSection 1.468B-2(k)(2) provides that a qualified settlement fund is in existence \nfor the period that (i) begins on the first date on which the fund is treated as a qualified \nsettlement fund under section 1.468B-1; and (ii) ends on the earlier of the date the fund \n(A) no longer satisfies the requirements of section 1.468B-1; or (B) no longer has any \nassets and will not receive any more transfers. \n \n \nBased on the facts represented, on Date 2 the escrow accounts established by \nCompany satisfied all three requirements of section 1.468B-1(c), and therefore are \ntreated as qualified settlement funds as of that date.  First, in Year 3 the escrow \naccounts were approved by the Cs and are subject to the continuing jurisdiction of the \nCs.  Each escrow account established by Company must be approved by the C for \nwhich the account is established.  The appropriate official of each C has the authority to \nmonitor and pursue in court charges against Company to enforce annual compliance \nwith the D. \n \n \nSecond, the escrow accounts are established to resolve or satisfy one or more \ncontested or uncontested claims that have resulted or may result from an event (or \nrelated series of events) that has occurred and that has given rise to at least one claim \nasserting liability arising out of a violation of law.  There is no question that Company \nused, sold, distributed, manufactured, developed, advertised, and marketed G products.  \nIn its draft complaint sent to Company on Date 2, L alleges at least one claim against \nCompany asserting liability arising out of a violation of laws resulting from the sale of G \nproducts and related actions.  The escrow accounts, although mandated by D, are \n \nPLR-124833-02 \n \n \n6 \nexpressly and solely established by Company to resolve or satisfy those, and similar, \nclaims. \n \n \nNote that the facts in this case are distinguishable from Example 7 in section \n1.468B-1(k) regarding a landfill operator.  There, a corporation owned and operated a \nlandfill in a state that required the corporation to transfer money to a trust annually \nbased on the total tonnage of material placed in the landfill during the year.  Under the  \nlaw, the corporation is required to perform (either itself or through contractors) specified \nclosure activities when the landfill is full, and the trust assets would be used to \nreimburse the corporation for these closure costs.  The trust in that example is not a \nqualified settlement fund because it is established to secure the liability of the \ncorporation to perform such closure activities.  The instant case does not involve a \nperformance liability.  The funds transferred to the escrow accounts under the D are not \nused to secure the future performance of Company.  To the contrary, the funds will be \nused to satisfy the Cs claims based on the past conduct of Company that has resulted \nin known injuries to the Cs (i.e., increased M and related financial burdens) that have \ngiven rise to known liabilities (i.e., violations of state laws) against Company. \n \n \nThird, the assets in the escrow accounts are segregated from other assets of \nCompany (and related persons).  Beginning in Year 3, Company established separate \nescrow accounts with several leading financial institutions, including accounts at B.  \nUnder the regulations, a separate bank account is sufficient to satisfy this requirement.  \nSee section 1.468B-1(h)(1). \n \n \nThus, since the escrow accounts satisfied all three requirements on Date 2 (in \nYear 4), Company is treated as transferring the assets to qualified settlement funds on \nDate 2, which is the first date on which the escrow accounts are treated as qualified \nsettlement funds under section 1.468B-1. \n \n \nREQUESTED RULINGS 2 and 3 \n \n \nDeduction of Payments  \n \n \nSection 162(a) of the Code provides the general rule that there shall be allowed \nas a deduction all the ordinary and necessary expenses paid or incurred during the \ntaxable year in carrying on any trade or business.  See also section 1.162-1(a).   \n   \n \nSection 461(a) provides, in part, that the amount of any deduction shall be taken \nfor the taxable year that is the proper taxable year under the method of accounting used \nin computing taxable income. \n \n \nPLR-124833-02 \n \n \n7 \nSection 1.461-1(a)(2) provides, in part, that under an accrual method of \naccounting, a liability is incurred, and generally taken into account for federal income tax \npurposes, in the taxable year in which all the events have occurred that establish the \nfact of the liability, the amount of the liability can be determined with reasonable \naccuracy, and economic performance has occurred with respect to the liability. \n \n \nSection 461(f) provides that if (1) the taxpayer contests an asserted liability, (2) \nthe taxpayer transfers money or other property to provide for the satisfaction of the \nasserted liability, (3) the contest with respect to the asserted liability exists after the time \nof the transfer, and (4) but for the fact that the asserted liability is contested, a deduction \nwould be allowed for the taxable year of the transfer (or for an earlier taxable year) \ndetermined after application of section 461(h), then the deduction shall be allowed for \nthe taxable year of the transfer. \n \n \nSection 461(h)(1) provides, in part, that in determining whether an amount has \nbeen incurred with respect to any item during the taxable year, the all events test shall \nnot be treated as met any earlier than when economic performance with respect to such \nitem occurs. \n \n \nSection 461(h)(4) provides that the all events test is met with respect to any item \nif all events have occurred which determine the fact of the liability and the amount of \nsuch liability can be determined with reasonable accuracy.  \n \n \nSection 1.468B-3(c)(1) provides that for purposes of section 461(h), economic \nperformance occurs with respect to a liability described in section 1.468B-1(c)(2) to the \nextent the transferor makes a transfer to a qualified settlement fund to resolve or satisfy \nthe liability. \n \n \nSection 1.468B-3(c)(2) provides that economic performance does not occur to \nthe extent (A) the transferor (or a related person) has a right to a refund or reversion of \na transfer if that right is exercisable currently and without the agreement of an unrelated \nperson that is independent or has an adverse interest (e.g., the court or agency that \napproved the fund, or the fund claimants), or (B) money or property is transferred under \nconditions that allow its refund or reversion by reason of the occurrence of an event that \nis certain to occur, such as the passage of time, or if restrictions on its refund or \nreversion are illusory. \n \n \nSection 1.468B-3(f)(1) provides that a transferor must include in gross income \nany distribution it receives from a qualified settlement fund. \n \n \nSection 1.468B-3(f)(3) provides that a distribution described in section 1.468B-\n3(f)(1) or (f)(2) is excluded from the gross income of a transferor to the extent provided \nby section 111(a) (regarding the recovery of tax benefit items). \n \n \nPLR-124833-02 \n \n \n8 \n \nBased on the above, the amounts transferred into escrow accounts will be used \nto pay money damages to the Cs for liabilities that arose as a result of Company\u2019s \nprincipal business activity, that is, the manufacture and sale of G products and F.  Thus, \nsuch amounts are deductible under section 162(a) as ordinary and necessary business \nexpenses.  To the extent that the all events tests under section 1.461-1(a)(2), including \neconomic performance, are met, the amounts transferred into the escrow accounts \nwould be deductible in the taxable year transferred.  In this case, the first prong of the \nall events test, i.e., all the events have occurred that establish the fact of the liability, is \nmet because this is a contested liability within the meaning of section 461(f).  Likewise,  \nthe second prong, i.e., the amount of the liability can be determined with reasonable \naccuracy, is met because the amount of the liability can be readily ascertained based on \nthe formula prescribed by the D.  Finally, under section 1.468B-3(c), transfers to a \nqualified settlement fund to resolve or satisfy claims for which it is established constitute \neconomic performance.  Therefore, transfers to the escrow accounts are deductible in \nthe taxable year Company makes the transfers to the qualified settlement funds.  In this \ncase, transfers made prior to Date 2 will be treated as made on Date 2, which is the first \ndate on which the escrow accounts are treated as qualified settlement funds.  See \nsupra. \n \nThe fact that the D provides for a reversion of monies if any remain after Number \nfrom the date of the transfers does not prevent economic performance from occurring \nunder the facts represented.  The D provides that the monies transferred into the \nescrow accounts revert to Company after Number from the date of the transfers if the \nCs have not filed and prevailed on claims either by obtaining a judgment against, or a \nsettlement with, Company.  The funds exist to satisfy C claims brought against \nCompany within Number after the date monies are transferred into the funds.  Company \nmay not access the funds for any purpose other than satisfying C claims during the \nNumber period.  Company expects that claims will be made against all the assets of the \nfunds and, if successful, the funds will be used to satisfy C claims and that nothing will \nremain to revert to Company.  There is no guarantee and little likelihood that any \namounts will revert to Company after Number.  The reversion in this case requires not \nonly the passage of time, but also the successful defense against claims brought by the \nCs before anything reverts to Company.  Although the passage of time (i.e., Number) is \ncertain to occur, it is clearly uncertain whether the Cs will neither file nor prevail on \nclaims against Company.  Thus, the payments are not transferred under conditions that \nallow its refund or reversion by reason of the occurrence of an event that is certain to \noccur.  Finally, Company does not have a currently exercisable right to a refund or \nreversion.  However, to the extent Company receives any distributions from the escrow \naccounts, e.g., overpayments, refunds, interest or other appreciation on the funds, \nCompany must include such amounts in its gross income. \n \n \n \n \n \nPLR-124833-02 \n \n \n9 \nREQUESTED RULING 4 \n \n \nTaxation of Escrow Accounts \n \n \nSection 1.468B-2(a) of the regulations provides that a qualified settlement fund is \na United States person and is subject to tax on its modified gross income for any \ntaxable year at a rate equal to the maximum rate in effect for that taxable year under \nsection 1(e) of the Code. \n \n \n \n \n \nSection 1.468B-2(k)(1) provides that a qualified settlement fund must file an \nincome tax return with respect to the tax imposed under section 1.468B-2(a) for each \ntaxable year that the fund is in existence, whether or not the fund has gross income for \nthat taxable year. \n \n \nBecause the escrow accounts in this case are qualified settlement funds \nbeginning in Year 4, they will be subject to tax on their modified gross income for any \ntaxable year that the qualified settlement funds are in existence at a rate equal to the \nmaximum rate in effect for that taxable year under section 1(e). \n \n \nREQUESTED RULING 5 \n \n \nPayments Not Gross Income to Escrow Accounts \n \nSection 1.468B-2(b)(1) of the regulations provides that, in general, amounts \ntransferred to the qualified settlement fund by, or on behalf of, a transferor to resolve or \nsatisfy a liability for which the fund is established are excluded from gross income.  \nHowever, dividends on stock of a transferor (or a related person), interest on debt of a \ntransferor (or a related person), and payments in compensation for late or delayed \ntransfers, are not excluded from gross income. \n \n \nIn this case the escrow accounts are qualified settlement funds that are \nestablished, pursuant to the approval of the Cs, to assume and pay Company\u2019s \nliabilities related to the sale of G products and F.  Accordingly, transfers made by, or on \nbehalf of, Company to resolve or satisfy such liabilities will not constitute gross income \n to the qualified settlement funds. \n \n \n \n \nPLR-124833-02 \n \n \n10 \nCONCLUSIONS \n \n \n \nBased solely on the information provided and the representations made, we \nconclude as follows: \n \n \n(1) The escrow accounts established with B pursuant to the D are treated as \nqualified settlement funds within the meaning of section 1.468B-1 of the regulations, as \nof Date 2, which is the date on which all of the requirements of section 1.468B-1 are \nsatisfied. \n \n \n(2) All transfers to the qualified settlement funds are deductible in the taxable \nyear transferred to qualified settlement funds.  With respect to transfers to escrow \naccounts made prior to Date 2, Company is treated as transferring those assets to \nqualified settlement funds on Date 2, which is the first date the escrow accounts are \ntreated as qualified settlement funds.  Further, to the extent the qualified settlement \nfunds make any distributions to Company for any overpayments or refunds in the event  \nmonies remain after Number from the date of transfer, Company must include such \namounts in its gross income to the extent provided by section 111.  In addition, to the \nextent the qualified settlement fund makes a distribution to Company for interest earned \non the escrow accounts, Company must include such amount in gross income under \nsection 61(a)(4).  See also \u00a7 61(a)(15). \n \n \n(3) Subsequent transfers to the qualified settlement funds, as well as new \nqualified settlement funds established with B or a similar financial institution to resolve \nor satisfy like claims of the Cs, will be deductible in the taxable year transfers are made \ninto the qualified settlement funds. \n \n \n(4) Each qualified settlement fund is subject to tax on its modified gross income \nfor any taxable year at a rate equal to the maximum rate in effect for that taxable year \nunder section 1(e) of the Code. \n \n \n(5) Transfers to the qualified settlement funds by Company will not constitute \ngross income to the qualified settlement funds.  However, the interest earned on the \nassets in the qualified settlement funds will constitute gross income to the qualified \nsettlement funds. \n \n \nExcept as expressly provided herein, no opinion is expressed or implied \nconcerning the tax consequences of any aspect of any transaction or item discussed or \nreferenced in this letter.  This ruling is directed only to Company who requested it.  \nSection 6110(k)(3) of the Code provides that it may not be used or cited as precedent. \n \n \nPLR-124833-02 \n \n \n11 \n \nIn accordance with the Powers of Attorney on file with this office, a copy of this \nletter is being sent to Company\u2019s authorized representatives.

The Trustee represents the\nfollowing facts.\nThe Trust was established by the Tribe under the Indian\nGaming Regulatory Act, 25 U.S.C. 2701 (1988) (the \"Act\"), for\nthe benefit of M, one of its minor members.  The purpose of\nTrust is to receive, hold, and invest payments made for the\nbenefit of M (\"per capita payments\"), under the Act and\npursuant to the Plan.  The Trust conducts no other business\nactivities.\nCongress enacted the Act on October 17, 1988.  Section 3\nof the Act provides that the purpose of the Act is to provide\na statutory basis for the operation of gaming by Indian tribes\nas a means of promoting tribal economic development, self-\nsufficiency, and strong tribal governments, and to declare\nthat the establishment of independent federal regulatory\nauthority for gaming on Indian lands, the establishment of \nfederal standards for gaming on Indian lands, and the\nestablishment of a National Indian Gaming Commission are\nnecessary to meet congressional concerns regarding gaming and\n-3-\nPLR-105061-98\nto protect such gaming as a means of generating tribal\nrevenue.\nSection 11(b)(3) of the Act provides that net revenues\nfrom any class II gaming activities conducted or licensed by\nany Indian tribe may be used to make per capita payments to\nmembers of the tribe only if: (A) the Indian tribe has\nprepared a plan to allocate revenues to uses authorized by \n\u00a7 11(b)(2)(B) of the Act; (B) the plan is approved by the\nSecretary of the Interior as adequate, particularly with\nrespect to the uses described in clause (i) or (iii) of\nparagraph (2)(B); (C) the interests of minors and other\nlegally incompetent persons who are entitled to receive any of\nthe per capita payments are protected and preserved and the\nper capita payments are disbursed to the parents or legal\nguardian of such minors or legal incompetents in such amounts\nas may be necessary for the health, education, or welfare of\nthe minor or other legally incompetent person under a plan\napproved by the Secretary of the Interior and the governing\nbody of the Indian tribe; and (D) the per capita payments are\nsubject to federal taxation and tribes notify members of such\ntax liability when payments are made.  Under \u00a7 11(d) of the\nAct, class III gaming activities are lawful on Indian lands if\nthey meet the requirements of \u00a7 11(b) of the Act.\nOn date a, the Tribe entered into the Compact with the\nState.  Subsequently, the Tribe adopted the Plan, which was\napproved by the Secretary of the Interior.  Pursuant to the\nPlan, g percent of net gaming proceeds are distributed to\ntribal members as per capita payments.  Regarding per capita\npayments, the Plan specifically provides, in part, that--\nPer Capita payments made to minors (under [ b] years\nof age) will be placed in a U.S. Government backed trust\nfund until they reach the age of [b].  At this time the\nmember may begin receiving their Per Capita Payments but\nany funds placed in Trust on their behalf shall remain in\nTrust until the member reaches the age of [ c].  At this\ntime the member may withdraw up to [d percent] of the\nTrust Fund per year but the amount withdrawn shall not\nexceed $e per year.  A member may continue to withdraw\nmoney from this fund at the same yearly rate until the\nmember reaches the age of [f].  Upon reaching the age of\n[f] the member may withdraw the remaining balance of\ntheir Trust Fund.\nOn date h, the Tribe adopted the Document.  The Tribe is\nthe settlor and the sole trustee of each trust created under\n-4-\nPLR-105061-98\nthe Document.  On date i, N, the mother of M, executed the\nAgreement ratifying the Document.\nThe Document and the Agreement create the Trust, which\nhas all the terms and provisions of the Document.  The\nDocument provides that \"all provisions of this Trust\ninstrument shall be construed, limited, and applied so as to\nresult in compliance with, and shall be subject to the\nprovisions of, the ... Act and/or Plan, including any changes\nor amendments thereto.\"  The Trust is irrevocable.  The Tribe\nretained the right to modify, alter, or amend the terms and\nprovisions of the Trust, \"provided such modification,\nalteration, or amendment is required under the [Act].\"\nThe sole principal and income beneficiary of each trust\ncreated under the Document is the beneficiary named in each\ntrust adoption agreement, which is similar to the Agreement. \nThe sole beneficiary of the Trust is M.  If M or any successor\nbeneficiary should die during the term of the Trust, the\ndescendants of the beneficiary, if any, shall receive that\nbeneficiary\u2019s share, in trust, for the remaining trust term,\nas if that descendant were the original beneficiary of the\nTrust.  If any beneficiary shall die without descendants\nduring the term of the Trust, that beneficiary\u2019s interest in\nthe Trust shall vest in equal proportion in the other\nsurviving siblings of the beneficiary.  If any beneficiary\nshall die without descendants and without siblings (or\ndescendants of siblings) during the term of the Trust, that\nbeneficiary\u2019s interest will revest in the Tribe to be\ndistributed as additional per capita payments under the Act\nand the Plan.\nThe term of the Trust will last until the beneficiary\nattains the age of f, whereupon all the beneficiary\u2019s share of\ncorpus and accumulated income, if any, shall be distributed to\nthat beneficiary free of trust.  The Tribe has the discretion\nto terminate the trust prior to the beneficiary attaining the\nage of f, in whole or in part, if the value of the trust\nproperty no longer justifies the expenses of trust management,\nor the Tribe considers such distribution to be in the best\ninterest of the beneficiary, considering the demonstrated\nability of the beneficiary to handle money properly and\nwisely, to use judgment, prudence, and discretion, and\nconsidering any other factors the Tribe may consider relevant.\nThe income of the beneficiary is accumulated in trust and\nadded to the principal of the trust unless a distribution is\nmade to the beneficiary under other provisions of the trust. \n-5-\nPLR-105061-98\nAccumulated income or principal may be distributed to a\nbeneficiary from that beneficiary\u2019s share of income or\nprincipal if the Tribe determines that the beneficiary needs\nresources for her health, education, or welfare, after taking\ninto consideration funds available from other sources known to\nthe Tribe, including financial sources of the beneficiary\u2019s\nparents or legal guardians.  For determining what constitutes\nthe health, education, or welfare of a beneficiary, the\nDocument provides detailed standards.\nThe Document provides that the law of the U.S. and of the\nTribe shall govern, control, and apply to the rights,\nobligations, terms, provisions, and discretions of the\nsettlor, trustee, beneficiaries, and property of the Trust. \nTo the extent not provided for under the laws of the U.S. and\nof the Tribe, the provisions of State trust law shall\notherwise apply to the Trust, except to the extent any\nprovision thereof has been specifically excluded by federal or\ntribal law.  The situs of the Trust is the tribal reservation\nof the Tribe.\nA full per capita share of the net gaming proceeds has\nbeen paid into the Trust since its creation.  For the Trust\u2019s\nfirst tax year (j), per capita payments totaling $k were paid\ninto the Trust.  No money was distributed from the Trust in j\nor m.  The Trust filed a j income tax return reflecting all\nper capita payments, and the $n of interest income earned\nthereon, as items of income reported by, and taxable to, the\nTrust at the Trust\u2019s income tax rate.  None of the per capita\npayments or the interest income earned thereon were reported\nas income by the Trust beneficiary.  For year m, the per\ncapita payments made to the Trust totaled $ p, and the Trust\u2019s\ninterest and dividend income was $q.\nSection 61 defines gross income as income from whatever\nsource derived.\nIn general, a cash basis taxpayer does not recognize\nincome upon the receipt of property in the form of a promise\nto pay in the future.  However, a cash basis taxpayer is taxed\nwhen the taxpayer receives an \"economic benefit\" from a right\nto receive property in the future.\nIn Sproull v. Commissioner, 16 T.C. 244 (1951), aff\u2019d per\ncuriam, 194 F.2d 541 (6th Cir. 1952), the court held that the\namount placed in trust to be paid out to the taxpayer in later\nyears conferred an economic benefit on the taxpayer in the\nyear the trust was funded.  In that case, the taxpayer, a\n-6-\nPLR-105061-98\ncorporation president, voluntarily decreased his compensation. \nIn a later year, when the corporation was sound financially, a\ntrust was set up by the board of directors for the benefit of\nthe taxpayer.  In determining that funding the trust conferred\nan economic benefit on the taxpayer in the year the trust was\nestablished, the court noted that the funds were placed in\ntrust irrevocably for the taxpayer\u2019s sole benefit and that the\ntaxpayer had to do nothing further to establish his right to\nit.\nThe economic benefit doctrine also has been applied to\nrequire inclusion in income of prize winnings when they are\nirrevocably placed in a fund to be paid to the winner at a\nlater date.  See Pulsifer v. Commissioner, 64 T.C. 245 (1975);\nAnastasio v. Commissioner, 67 T.C. 814 (1977); Rev. Rul. 62-\n74, 1962-1 C.B. 68; and Rev. Rul 67-203, 1967-1 C.B. 105.\nRev. Rul. 83-25, 1983-1 C.B. 116, holds that a minor\nreceived the economic benefit of a trust when it was\nestablished by court order to receive damages awarded to the\nminor as a result of a personal injury suit.  Under the terms\nof the trust, the trustee was authorized to distribute funds\nnecessary for the health, education, support, or maintenance\nof the minor.  The trust was not subject to revocation by the\nminor, but was subject to amendment, modification, or\nrevocation by the court.  The trust was to terminate upon the\nminor reaching the age of 21, at which time the trust would\ndistribute all of its property to him.  Rev. Rul. 83-25\nfurther holds that the minor is the owner of the damages; the\nminor is treated as the grantor of the trust, and under \n\u00a7 677(a), as the owner of the trust because the trust income\nand corpus is to be distributed to the minor at the discretion\nof the court, a nonadverse party, or eventually distributed to\nthe minor when the minor turns 21 years old.\nSection 671 provides that, where it is specified under\nsubpart E that the grantor or another person shall be treated\nas the owner of any portion of a trust, there shall then be\nincluded in computing the taxable income and credits of the\ngrantor or the other person those items of income, deductions,\nand credits against tax of the trust that are attributable to\nthat portion of the trust to the extent that such items would\nbe taken into account under chapter 1 in computing taxable\nincome or credits against the tax of an individual.\nSection 673 provides that the grantor shall be treated as\nthe owner of any portion of a trust in which he has a\nreversionary interest in either the corpus or the income\n-7-\nPLR-105061-98\ntherefrom if, as of the inception of that portion of the\ntrust, the value of that interest exceeds 5 percent of the\nvalue of that portion.\nIn Estate of Cardeza v. U.S., 261 F2d. 423 (3d Cir.\n1958), the court held that a reversionary interest in a trust\nthat would have become effective only if the decedent-grantor\nhad survived the current beneficiaries and their issue did not\nmake the grantor\u2019s contributions to the trust includable in\nher gross estate.  This holding was reached under a statute\nproviding that property, the transfer of which was intended to\ntake effect at or after the transferor\u2019s death, would not be\nincludable in gross estate unless the transferor retained a\nreversionary interest worth more than 5 percent of the value\nof the property transferred.  The court concluded that a\nreversion dependent upon the failure of issue is not\nsusceptible to valuation using actuarial principles, and thus,\nunder the rule established in Robinette v. Helvering, 318 U.S.\n184 (1943), is considered to have no value.\nSection 677 provides that the grantor shall be treated as\nthe owner of any portion of a trust, whether or not he is\ntreated as such owner under \u00a7 674, whose income without the\napproval or consent of any adverse party is, or, in the\ndiscretion of the grantor or a nonadverse party, or both, may\nbe distributed to the grantor or the grantor's spouse; or held\nor accumulated for future distribution to the grantor or the\ngrantor's spouse.\nIf M dies before age f, her interest in the Trust vests\nfirst in her descendants, and if none is living, then in her\nsiblings.  If M has no living descendants or siblings, then\nher interest vests in the descendants of her siblings.  If,\nupon M's death before age f, no one exists in any of these\nclasses of successor beneficiaries, then the property held in\nthe Trust reverts to the Tribe to be distributed as additional\nper capita payments to other tribal members.  The Tribe has a\nreversionary interest in the Trust.  We have determined,\nhowever, that no reasonable assumption exists that would\npermit the possibility of issue to be ignored or discounted. \nThus, because the Tribe's reversionary interest cannot be\nvalued using actuarial principles, we conclude that the value\nof the Tribe's reversionary interest is zero and that the\nTribe should not be considered the owner of the Trust under \n\u00a7 673.\nUnder \u00a7 11(b)(3)(C) of the Act, the Tribe may not provide\nfor per capita payments unless \"the interests of minors and\n-8-\nPLR-105061-98\nother legally incompetent persons who are entitled to receive\nany of the per capita payments are protected and preserved.\" \nThe Tribe made the per capita payments to the Trust for M\u2019s \n-9-\nPLR-105061-98\nbenefit.  The Agreement contains numerous provisions\nprotecting the trust beneficiary\u2019s interest in the per capita\npayments.\nThe Trust is irrevocable and was established for the sole\nbenefit of M.  Considering the provisions of the Act, the\nPlan, and the Document, we conclude that M receives the\neconomic benefit of the per capita payments when they are\ndeposited into the Trust.  When the per capita payments are\nmade, M must treat these payments to the Trust, as well as all\nincome earned therefrom, as items of gross income reportable\non her individual federal income tax return.\nAs the owner of the per capita payments deposited in the\nTrust, M is considered the grantor of the Trust.  Under the\nprovisions of the Trust, trust income and corpus are to be\ndistributed to the trust beneficiary at the discretion of a\nnon-adverse party, or held or accumulated for future\ndistribution.  We conclude, therefore, that M is the owner of\nthe Trust under \u00a7 677(a). \nAfter applying the applicable law to the facts\nrepresented, we rule that:\n1.  M is in receipt of an economic benefit upon the\nfunding of the Trust with the per capita payments, and\ntherefore, under \u00a7 61, must include the deposits of the\nper capita payments in her gross income for the year in\nwhich they are made to the trust.\n2.  For federal income tax purposes, M is treated as the\ngrantor of the Trust.\n3.  Under \u00a7 677, M is the owner of the Trust, and\ntherefore, must include all items of income, deductions,\nand credits of the Trust in determining her taxable\nincome.\nThese rulings are conditioned on M and the Trust filing\namended returns for year j, properly reflecting M's ownership\nof the Trust.  Except for the specific rulings above, no\nopinion is expressed or implied concerning the federal tax\nconsequences of the facts of this case under any other\nprovision of the Code.\nUnder the power of attorney on file with this office, we\nare sending a copy of this letter to your authorized\nrepresentative.\n-10-\nPLR-105061-98\nThis ruling is directed only to the taxpayer who\nrequested it.

The information submitted in that request and \nin later correspondence is summarized below.\nThe rulings contained in this letter are based upon information and representations \nsubmitted by the taxpayer and accompanied by a penalty of perjury statement executed \nby an appropriate party.   \nPLR-117996-12\n3\nThis office has not verified any of the materials submitted in support of the request for \nrulings.  Verification of the information, representations, and other data may be required \nas part of the audit process.  In particular, no determination has been made regarding \nwhether the Internal or External Distribution (defined below):  (i) satisfies the business \npurpose requirement of section 1.355-2(b) of the Income Tax Regulations, (ii) is used \nprincipally as a device for the distribution of the earnings and profits of Parent, \nDistributing or Controlled (see section 355(a)(1)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code and \nTreas. Reg. section 1.355-2(d)), or (iii) is part of a plan (or series of related transactions) \npursuant to which one or more persons will acquire directly or indirectly stock \nrepresenting a 50 percent or greater interest in Parent, Distributing or Controlled (see \nsection 355(e) and Treas.

Parent is the common parent of an affiliated group of corporations that \nfiles a consolidated federal income tax return.  Distributing is a State A corporation and \nis an accrual method taxpayer that, at all times relevant to this request, has joined with \nParent in filing a consolidated federal income tax return with a calendar year end.  \nDistributing is directly engaged in Business A and Business B.  Approximately a percent \nof Parent\u2019s outstanding common stock is held by Individual 1, approximately b percent \nis held by Individual 2 and approximately c percent is held by Individual 3 (Individual 1, \nIndividual 2 and Individual 3 are the \u201cShareholders\u201d).  Approximately d percent of \nParent\u2019s outstanding convertible preferred stock (\u201cPreferred Stock\u201d) is held by Equity \nFund 1 and approximately e percent is held by Equity Fund 2.  There are f warrants \nissued to the holders of Preferred Stock (Equity Fund 1 and 2 are the \u201cPreferred Stock \nand Warrant Holders\u201d).  \nParent currently has outstanding stock options issued under its stock option plan. The \noutstanding options consist of incentive stock options granted to Individual 2 to \npurchase g shares of Parent common stock (the \u201cOutstanding Options\u201d).  \nBusiness A has had gross receipts and operating expenses representative of the active \nconduct of a trade or business for each of the past five years.  Business B constitutes \nan expansion of Business A and does not constitute a new or different business.\nProposed Transaction\nFor what are represented to be valid business purposes, Parent and Distributing \npropose to undertake the following steps (the \u201cProposed Transaction\u201d):\n(i)\nDistributing will form Controlled, a State A corporation. \nPLR-117996-12\n4\n(ii)\nDistributing will contribute the assets and liabilities constituting Business B as \ncurrently conducted by Distributing to Controlled in exchange for shares of \nControlled common stock, shares of convertible preferred stock and warrants, \nwhich will represent 100 percent of the Controlled common and convertible \npreferred stock and warrants outstanding (the \u201cContribution\u201d).\n(iii)\nDistributing and Controlled will execute a debt facility agreement creating the \nControlled Debt.\n(iv)\nDistributing will distribute all its shares of Controlled common and convertible \npreferred stock and warrants (representing 100 percent of the Controlled \ncommon and convertible preferred stock and warrants outstanding) to Parent \n(the \u201cInternal Distribution\u201d).\n(v)\nParent will distribute all of its shares of Controlled common and convertible \npreferred stock and warrants (representing 100 percent of the Controlled \ncommon, convertible preferred stock and warrants outstanding) to the \nShareholders and the Preferred Stock and Warrant Holders in identical \nproportion to their ownership of Parent (the \u201cExternal Distribution\u201d).  \n(vi)\nThe Outstanding Options will be exchanged for new incentive stock options \nsubject to the same terms and vesting schedule as the related Outstanding \nOptions.  Individual 2 will surrender his Outstanding Options and receive, in \nexchange, adjusted stock options in Parent (\u201cNew Parent Options\u201d) and \nControlled (\u201cNew Controlled Options\u201d).  The New Parent and New Controlled \nOptions will preserve the economic value of the Outstanding Options. The \nexercise price of the New Parent Options and the New Controlled Options will \nbear the same percentage relationship to the market price of Parent and \nControlled common stock after the External Distribution as the exercise price \nof the Outstanding Options bore to the market price of Parent stock before the \nProposed Transaction.\n(vii)\nTo accommodate Controlled\u2019s business needs, Individual 1 and Individual 2, \nboth employees of Distributing, will serve as employees for Distributing and \nControlled after the External Distribution.\n(viii)\nTo accommodate Controlled\u2019s business needs, three of the five directors for \nDistributing will also serve as three of the five directors for Controlled (the \n\u201cOverlapping Directors\u201d).  Controlled intends that within h years of the \nExternal Distribution, as a result of the addition of new directors, the \nresignation by Overlapping Directors, the removal of Overlapping Directors \nfrom the Controlled board, or other means, the Overlapping Directors will \nconstitute a minority of Controlled\u2019s board of directors.\nPLR-117996-12\n5\n(ix)\nIn connection with the Proposed Transaction, Distributing and Controlled will \nenter into certain agreements concerning continuing business arrangements \nrelating to Business A and Business B (the \u201cContinuing Arrangements\u201d).  The \nContinuing Arrangements are expected to exist for less than i years.\nRepresentations\n(a)\nBusiness B is an expansion of Business A, an existing business, as \ncontemplated by Treas. Reg. section 1.355-3(b)(3)(ii).\n(b)\nNone of the Controlled convertible preferred stock will be nonqualified \npreferred stock within the meaning of section 351(g)(2).\n(c)\nThere are no accumulated but unpaid dividends to the Preferred Stock.\n(d)\nThere is no regulatory, legal, contractual, or economic compulsion or \nrequirement that Distributing fund part or all of the Controlled Debt as a \ncondition of the distribution of Controlled.\n(e)\nThe exercise price of, and the number of Parent shares subject to, the \nOutstanding Options will be adjusted to reflect the change in value of Parent \nshares as a result of the Proposed Transaction in a manner that, on a share-\nby-share basis, (a) preserves the aggregate spread between the exercise \nprice of the Outstanding Options and the fair market value of the underlying \nParent stock immediately before the adjustment, and (b) produces a ratio of \nthe exercise price of the New Parent Options and New Controlled Options to \nthe fair market value of the underlying Parent or Controlled stock immediately \nafter the External Distribution that is equal to the ratio of the exercise price of \nthe Outstanding Options to the fair market value of the underlying Parent \ncommon stock immediately before the Proposed Transaction.\nContribution and Internal Distribution\n(f)\nThe indebtedness, if any, owed by Controlled to Distributing after the Internal \nDistribution will not constitute stock or securities.\n(g)\nNo part of the consideration to be distributed by Distributing will be received \nby Parent as a creditor or in any capacity other than that of a shareholder of \nDistributing.\n(h)\nThe five years of financial information with regard to Business A and less than \nfive years of financial information with regard to Business B has been \nsubmitted on behalf of Distributing and is representative of Distributing's \npresent operations, and with regard to such operations, there have been no \nPLR-117996-12\n6\nsubstantial operational changes since the date of the last financial statements \nsubmitted.\n(i)\nNeither Business A nor control of an entity conducting this business will have \nbeen acquired during the five-year period ending on the date of the Internal \nDistribution in a transaction in which gain or loss was recognized (or treated \nas recognized under proposed Treas. Reg. section 1.355-3) in whole or in \npart.  Throughout the five-year period ending on the date of the Internal \nDistribution, Distributing has been the principal owner of the goodwill and \nsignificant assets of Business A and will continue to be the principal owner \nfollowing the Internal Distribution.\n(j)\nFollowing the Internal Distribution, Distributing will continue the active conduct \nof Business A, and Controlled will continue the active conduct of Business B, \nboth of which were conducted by Distributing prior to consummation of the\nProposed Transaction and independently and with their separate employees \n(except as provided by the Continuing Arrangements).\n(k)\nThe Internal Distribution will be carried out for the following corporate \nbusiness purposes: (i) simplifying and clarifying the operational structure of \nBusiness A and Business B, streamlining management, reporting and \nadministration, and achieving strategic coherence; and (ii) using equity \nincentives to enable Business A and Business B to attract, retain and properly \nprovide incentives to management (the \u201cCorporate Business Purposes\u201d). The \ndistribution of the common stock, convertible preferred stock and warrants of \nControlled is motivated, in whole or substantial part, by one or more of these \nCorporate Business Purposes.  \n(l)\nThe Internal Distribution is not used principally as a device for the distribution \nof the earnings and profits of Distributing.  See section 355(a)(1)(B).\n(m)\nFor purposes of section 355(d), immediately after the Internal Distribution, no \nperson (determined after applying section 355(d)(7)) will hold stock \npossessing 50 percent or more of the total combined voting power of all \nclasses of Distributing stock entitled to vote or 50 percent or more of the total \nvalue of shares of all classes of Distributing stock that was acquired by \npurchase (as defined in section 355(d)(5) and (8)) during the five-year period \n(determined after applying section 355(d)(6)) ending on the date of the \nInternal Distribution.\n(n)\nFor purposes of section 355(d), immediately after the Internal Distribution, no \nperson (determined after applying section 355(d)(7)) will hold stock \npossessing 50 percent or more of the total combined voting power of all \nclasses of Controlled stock entitled to vote, or 50 percent or more of the total \nPLR-117996-12\n7\nvalue of shares of all classes of Controlled stock that was either (i) acquired \nby purchase (as defined in section 355(d)(5) and (8)) during the five-year \nperiod (determined after applying section 355(d)(6)) ending on the date of \nInternal Distribution or (ii) attributable to distributions on Distributing stock or \nsecurities that were acquired by purchase (as defined in section 355(d)(5) \nand (8)) during the five-year period (determined after applying section \n355(d)(6)) ending on the date of the Internal Distribution.\n(o)\nThe Internal Distribution is not part of a plan or series of related transactions \n(within the meaning of Treas. Reg. section 1.355-7) pursuant to which one or \nmore persons will acquire directly or indirectly stock representing a 50 percent \nor greater interest (within the meaning of section 355(d)(4)) in Distributing or \nControlled (including any predecessor or successor of any such corporation).\n(p)\nNo person will hold, immediately after the Internal Distribution, a 50 percent or \ngreater interest in any disqualified investment corporation (as defined in \nsection 355(g)(2)), that such person did not hold before the Internal \nDistribution (taking into account section 355(g)(3) and (g)(4)).\n(q)\nThe total adjusted basis and the fair market value of the assets transferred to \nControlled in the Contribution will equal or exceed the sum of (i) the total \nliabilities assumed (within the meaning of section 357(d)) by Controlled, and \n(ii) the total amount of any money and the fair market value of any other \nproperty (within the meaning of section 361(b)) received by Distributing and \ntransferred to its creditors in connection with the reorganization.\n(r)\nThe liabilities assumed (within the meaning of section 357(d)) by Controlled in \nthe Contribution, if any, and the liabilities to which the transferred assets are \nsubject, if any, were incurred in the ordinary course of business and are \nassociated with the assets being transferred.\n(s)\nThe total fair market value of the assets transferred by Distributing to \nControlled in the Contribution will exceed the sum of: (i) the amount of any \nliabilities assumed (within the meaning of section 357(d)) by Controlled in \nconnection with the exchange, (ii) the amount of any liabilities owed to \nControlled by Distributing that are discharged or extinguished in connection \nwith the exchange, and (iii) the amount of cash and the fair market value of \nany other property (other than stock and securities permitted to be received \nunder section 361(a) without the recognition of gain) received by Distributing \nin connection with the exchange. The fair market value of the assets of \nControlled will exceed the amount of its liabilities immediately after the \nexchange.\n(t)\nThe aggregate fair market value of the assets transferred to Controlled in the \nPLR-117996-12\n8\nContribution will equal or exceed the aggregate adjusted basis of these \nassets.\n(u)\nExcept for indebtedness that may be created in the ordinary course of \nbusiness or in connection with the Continuing Arrangements or the Controlled \nDebt, no intercorporate debt will exist between Distributing and Controlled at \nthe time of, or subsequent to, the Internal Distribution.\n(v)\nAt the time of the Internal Distribution, Distributing will not have an excess \nloss account in the Controlled stock.\n(w)\nImmediately before the Internal Distribution, items of income, gain, loss, \ndeduction, and credit will be taken into account as required by the applicable \nintercompany transaction regulations (see Treas.

The information submitted in that\nletter and later correspondence is summarized below.\nDistributing, a State A corporation, is the parent of a consolidated group of\ncorporations and uses the accrual method of accounting.  Distributing has two classes\nof stock,               stock of which approximately A shares are outstanding and                  \n              stock of which approximately B shares are outstanding.  The               stock is\nwidely held and publicly traded.  The                            stock controls approximately X\npercent of the total voting power of Distributing and is almost exclusively owned by\nFamily.  Distributing and its subsidiaries are engaged in two businesses, Business C\nand Business D, both in the United States and in other countries including Country B.  \nAmong Distributing\u2019s subsidiaries are Subsidiaries 1-10 and Controlled. \nSubsidiary 1, a State B corporation, is a wholly-owned, first-tier subsidiary of\nDistributing and is engaged in both Business C and Business D.  Subsidiaries 2, 4, and\n5, State C corporations, are wholly-owned first-tier subsidiaries of Distributing and are\nengaged in Business D only.  Subsidiaries 3, 7, 8, and 9, State A subsidiaries, are also\nwholly-owned, first-tier subsidiaries of Distributing and are engaged in Business D only. \nSubsidiary 6, a State D corporation, is also a wholly-owned, first-tier subsidiary of\nDistributing and is engaged in Business D only.  Subsidiary 10, a Country B corporation, \nis currently owned Y percent by Subsidiary 6 and Z percent by Subsidiary 8 and is\nengaged in both Business C and Business D.  Controlled,  a State A corporation, was\nformed on Date 1 for purposes of the proposed transaction.  Controlled has two classes \nof stock,               stock and                            stock.\nDistributing has determined that it needs to borrow $E to meet the scheduled\nand anticipated obligations of Business C.  Distributing has been experiencing problems\nborrowing such funds.  Several rating agencies have downgraded Distributing\u2019s credit\nrating due to its ownership of Business D significantly increasing Distributing\u2019s cost of\nborrowing.  Accordingly, Distributing intends to separate its two businesses by\ntransferring Business D to Controlled and then distributing Controlled to its\nshareholders in a proposed transaction with the following steps:\n4\nPLR-120160-98\n(1)\nSubsidiary 10 will form Subsidiary 11, a Country B corporation, and will transfer\nall of its assets associated with Business D to Subsidiary 11 in exchange for all\nof the Subsidiary 11 stock.\n(2)\nSubsidiary 10 will then undergo a recapitalization issuing pro rata to its\nshareholders, in exchange for the currently outstanding Subsidiary 10 stock, new\n              and                                  stock (reorganization shares) redeemable for\nan amount equal to the fair market value of the Business D assets transferred to\nSubsidiary 11.\n(3)\nSubsidiary 6 and Subsidiary 8 will form Subsidiary 12, a Country B corporation,\nand will transfer to Subsidiary 12 the reorganization shares of Subsidiary 10 in\nexchange for the Y percent and Z percent of the Subsidiary 12 stock,\nrespectively.\n(4)\nSubsidiary 10 will then transfer to Subsidiary 12, all of the stock of Subsidiary 11\nin exchange for                                  stock in Subsidiary 12 (the \u201cspecial shares\u201d)\nhaving a fair market value equal to the Subsidiary 11 stock.\n(5)\nSubsidiary 10 will redeem its reorganization shares by issuing to Subsidiary 12 a\nnon-interest bearing note in the amount of the redemption value of the\nreorganization shares.\n(6)\nSubsidiary 12 will redeem its special shares by assigning back to Subsidiary 10\nthe note issued by Subsidiary 10 in redemption of the reorganization shares.\n(7)\nImmediately thereafter, Subsidiary 11 will be liquidated into Subsidiary 10 and\ndissolved.\n(8)\nSubsidiary 6 and Subsidiary 8 will then distribute the stock of Subsidiary 10 to\nDistributing.\n(9)\nSubsidiary 1 which holds certain intangibles associated with both Business C\nand Business D will liquidate into Distributing.  Subsequently, the intangibles\nassociated with Business D will be transferred to Controlled.\n(10)\nDistributing then will transfer the stock of Subsidiaries 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 to\nControlled in exchange for Controlled                        and Controlled                       \n             stock (the contributions).  The stock of Controlled will then be distributed\npro rata to the shareholders of Distributing.\nThe taxpayer has supplied financial information which indicates that Distributing\nand Controlled will each be conducting a business that has had gross receipts and\noperating expenses representative of the active conduct of the business for each of the\n5\nPLR-120160-98\npast five years.\nThe following representations have been made in connection with the proposed\ntransaction:\n(a)\nDistributing will pay the expenses incurred in the proposed transaction.\n(b)\nNo part of the consideration distributed by Distributing will be received by a\nshareholder of Distributing as a creditor, employee, or in any capacity other than\nthat of a shareholder of Distributing.\n(c)\nFollowing the distribution, Distributing and Controlled will each continue the\nactive conduct of its respective business, independently and with separate\nemployees.\n(d)\nThe total adjusted basis and the fair market value of the assets to be transferred\nto Controlled in the contributions will, in each instance, equal or exceed the sum\nof the liabilities assumed by Controlled plus any liabilities to which the transferred\nassets are subject.\n(e)\nThe liabilities assumed by Controlled in the contributions and the liabilities to\nwhich the transferred assets are subject will have been incurred in the ordinary\ncourse of business and will be associated with the transferred assets.\n(f)\nThe distribution of the stock of Controlled is carried out for the corporate\nbusiness purpose of facilitating Distributing to borrow funds necessary to meet\nscheduled and anticipated obligations of Business C. \n(g)\nThe management of Distributing, to its best knowledge, is not aware of any plan\nor intention on the part of any particular shareholder of Distributing to sell,\nexchange, transfer by gift, or otherwise dispose of any stock in either Distributing\nor Controlled after the distribution.\n(h)\nThe five years of financial information submitted for Business C and Business D\nrepresent the present operations of each respective business, and regarding\neach business, there has been no substantial operational change since the date\nof the last financial statement submitted.\n(i)\nThere is no plan or intention to liquidate either Distributing or Controlled, to\nmerge either corporation with any other corporation, or to sell or otherwise\ndispose of any of the assets of either corporation after the proposed\ntransactions, except in the ordinary course of business.\n(j)\nNone of the transferred assets will be subject to investment tax credit recapture.\n6\nPLR-120160-98\n(k)\nAny indebtedness owed by Controlled to Distributing after the distribution of\nControlled stock will not be stock or securities under \u00a7 355.\n(l)\nPayments made in all continuing transactions between Distributing and\nControlled will be for fair market value based on terms and conditions arrived at\nby the parties bargaining at arm\u2019s length.\n(m)\nNo two parties to the transactions are investment companies as defined in         \n\u00a7 368(a)(2)(F)(iii) and (iv).\n(n)\nExcept in connection with a stock repurchase program, there is no plan or\nintention by either Distributing or Controlled, directly or through any subsidiary\ncorporation, to purchase any of its outstanding stock after the distribution other\nthan through stock purchases meeting the requirements of \u00a7 4.05(1)(b) of Rev.\nProc. 96-30, 1996-1 C.B. 696, 705.\n(o)\nImmediately before the distribution, items of income, gain, loss, deduction and\ncredit, if any, will be taken into account as required by the applicable\nintercompany regulations. (See \u00a7 1.1502-13 and \u00a7 1.1502-14 in effect before the\npublication of T.D. 8597, 1995-2 C.B. 147, and as currently in effect; \u00a7 1.1502-13\nas published by T.D. 8597).  Distributing will not have an excess loss account in\nthe stock of any corporation that will leave the Distributing consolidated group in\nthe distribution.\n(p)\nThe distribution is not part of a plan or series of related transactions (within the\nmeaning of section 355(e)) pursuant to which one or more persons will acquire\ndirectly or indirectly stock possessing 50 percent or more of the total combined\nvoting power of all classes of stock of either Distributing or Controlled or stock\npossessing 50 percent or more of the total value of all classes of stock of either\nDistributing or Controlled.\n(q)\nThe gross assets of the trades or businesses relied on to satisfy the active trade\nor business requirement of \u00a7 355(b) for both the distribution of Controlled and\nthe distribution of Subsidiary 12 will have a fair market value that is at least 5\npercent of the total fair market value of the gross assets of the corporation\ndirectly conducting the trade or businesses.\n(r)\nMore than 80% of the value of the outstanding stock of Controlled will be\ndistributed with respect to the outstanding               stock of Distributing that is\nregularly traded on an established securities market.\n(s)\nDistributing does not know, or have reason to know, of any foreign person that\nowns a 5% or greater interest in either class of Distributing               stock.\n7\nPLR-120160-98\n(t)\nDistributing will comply with the notice requirements of \u00a7 1.367(e)-1T(c)(2)(iii).\nBased solely on the information submitted and the representations made, we\nrule as follows:\n(1)\nSteps 1-8 of the proposed transaction will be treated as the transfer by\nSubsidiary 10 of its Business C assets to Subsidiary 12 followed by the\ndistribution of Subsidiary 12 stock to Subsidiary 6 and Subsidiary 8. (Rev. Rul.\n83-142, 1983-2 C.B. 68; Rev. Rul. 77-191, 1977-1 C.B. 94; Rev. Rul. 67-448,\n1967-2 C.B. 144).\n(2)\nThe transfer by Distributing of the assets and liabilities of Business C to\nControlled in exchange for all the stock of Controlled followed by the distribution\nof all of the Controlled stock to the shareholders of Controlled constitutes a\nreorganization within the meaning of \u00a7 368(a)(1)(D) of the Code.  Distributing\nand Controlled will each be a \u201cparty to a reorganization\u201d within the meaning of   \n\u00a7 368(b). \n(3)\nNo gain or loss will be recognized by Distributing as a result of the transfer of the\nassets of Business C to Controlled for the Controlled stock and the assumption \nby Controlled of the Business C liabilities. (\u00a7\u00a7 361(a) and 357(a))\n(4)\nNo gain or loss will be recognized by Controlled on the receipt of the assets of\nBusiness C in exchange for the stock of Controlled.  (\u00a7 1032(a))\n(5)\nThe basis of each asset received by Controlled will be, in each instance, the\nsame as the basis of such asset in the hands of Distributing immediately prior to\nthe distribution. (\u00a7 362(b))\n(6)\nThe holding period of the Business D assets received by Controlled will include\nthe period during which such assets were held by Distributing.  (\u00a7 1223(2))\n(7)\nNo gain or loss will be recognized by, and no amount will be included in the\nincome of, Distributing, on the distribution of shares of Controlled to the\nDistributing shareholders.  (\u00a7\u00a7 361(c))\n(8)\nNo gain or loss will be recognized by, and no amount will otherwise be included\nin the income of, the Distributing shareholders on their receipt of Controlled stock\nin the distribution.  (\u00a7 355(a)(1))\n(9)\nThe aggregate basis of the Controlled stock and the Distributing stock in the\nhands of the shareholders of Distributing, immediately following the distribution,\nwill be the same as the basis of the Distributing stock held immediately before\n8\nPLR-120160-98\nthe distribution, allocated in proportion to the fair market value of each in\naccordance with \u00a7 1.358-2(a)(2).  (\u00a7 358(b)(2))\n(10)\nThe holding period of the Controlled stock received by each Distributing\nshareholder will be the holding period of the Distributing               stock or\nDistributing                            stock as to which the distribution is made, provided\nthat the Distributing               stock or the Distributing                            stock is\nheld as a capital asset on the date of the distribution.  (\u00a7 1223(1))\n(11)\nAs provided in \u00a7 312(h), proper allocation of earnings and profits between\nDistributing and Controlled will be made under \u00a7 1.312-10(a) and 1.1502-33.\n(12)\nNo gain or loss will be recognized by, and no amount will be included in the\nincome of Subsidiary 10, on the deemed distribution of shares of Subsidiary 12\nto its shareholders.

Reg. \u00a71.901-2A(c)(3) in determining the amount of foreign income tax paid or \naccrued to Country L.  The information submitted for consideration is substantially as \nset forth below. \n \nThe ruling contained in this letter is based upon information and representations \nsubmitted by the taxpayer and accompanied by a penalty of perjury statement executed \nby an appropriate party.  While this office has not verified any of the material submitted \nin support of the request for rulings, it is subject to verification on examination. \n \nCorp A is a domestic corporation that is the common parent of an affiliated group of \ncorporations (\u201cthe Corp A Group\u201d) that filed a U.S. consolidated federal income tax \nreturn for Tax Year X and for all subsequent tax years.  The due date (including \n \nPLR-138976-06 \n \n \n2 \nextensions) for Corp A\u2019s U.S. consolidated federal income tax return for Tax Year Y is \nDate N, which is more than 30 days after August 7, 2006.    \n \n \nThe Corp A Group\u2019s Country L operations are conducted by several domestic and \nforeign subsidiaries.  Several of these subsidiaries are, and have been, dual capacity \ntaxpayers, as defined in Treas. Reg. \u00a71.901-2(a)(2)(ii)(A), with respect to their \noperations in Country L.   \n \nCorp B, now known as Corp C, a wholly owned domestic subsidiary of Corp A, filed a \nsafe harbor election under Treas. Reg. \u00a71.901-2A(d)(3)(ii) with respect to Country L \nlevies paid or accrued by members of its consolidated group for Tax Year X and for \nsubsequent years.  That safe harbor election has not been revoked under \u00a71.901-\n2A(d)(4).   \n \nTreas. Reg. \u00a71.901-2A(c)(1) permits dual capacity taxpayers in computing foreign tax \ncredits for qualifying levies of each country to use either a \u201cfacts and circumstances\u201d \nmethod or a \u201dsafe harbor\u201d method to determine the amount of a levy that is not paid in \nexchange for a specific economic benefit. \n \nTreas. Reg. \u00a71.901-2A(d) describes the manner in which taxpayers may elect and \nrevoke the safe harbor method.  Treas. Reg. \u00a71.901-2A(d)(4) provides that the safe \nharbor method election may not be revoked without the consent of the Commissioner.  \nAn application for consent to revoke the election must be made not later than 30 days \nbefore the due date (including extensions) for the filing of the income tax return for the \nfirst taxable year for which the revocation is sought to be effective, with certain \nexceptions not applicable to this situation.  The Commissioner may make his consent to \nany revocation conditioned upon adjustments being made in one or more taxable years \nso as to prevent the revocation from resulting in a distortion of the amount of any item \nrelating to tax liability in any taxable year.  The Commissioner will normally consent to a \nrevocation under the circumstances described in \u00a71.901-2A(d)(4)(i) through (vi). \n \nTreas. Reg. \u00a71.901-2A(d)(4)(vi) provides that the Commissioner will normally consent to \na revocation of a safe harbor election if the election has been in effect with respect to at \nleast three taxable years prior to the taxable year for which the revocation is to be \neffective.   \n \nBased solely on the information and representations submitted, Corp A\u2019s application for \nconsent to revoke the safe harbor election with respect to qualifying levies of Country L \nwas made not later than 30 days before Date N, the due date (including extension) for \nCorp A\u2019s U.S. consolidated federal income tax return for Tax Year Y, and the applicable \nsafe harbor election has been in effect with respect to at least Corp A\u2019s last three \ntaxable years prior to Tax Year Y.  Accordingly, consent is granted to Corp A to revoke \nthe safe harbor election effective for Tax Year Y and for all subsequent taxable years. \n \nPLR-138976-06 \n \n \n3 \n \nNo opinion was requested, and no opinion is expressed, as to whether, based upon all \nof the relevant facts and circumstances, the amount (if any) paid pursuant to a levy or \nlevies imposed by Country L is not an amount paid in exchange for a specific economic \nbenefit. \n \nExcept as expressly provided herein, no opinion is expressed or implied concerning the \ntax consequences of any aspect of any transaction or item discussed or referenced in \nthis letter. \n \nThis ruling is directed only to the taxpayer requesting it.

Taxpayer requests that the \nInternal Revenue Service rule that a Transaction (as described below) will be treated as \na real estate asset under sections 856(c)(4) and 856(c)(5)(B) of the Internal Revenue \nCode of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d).  Additionally, Taxpayer requests a ruling that \ngross income realized by Taxpayer from payments made under a Transaction will \ngenerate income that is treated as gain from the sale or other disposition of real \nproperty (including interests in real property and interests in mortgages on real property) \nPLR-123109-11\n2\nwhich is not property described in section 1221(a)(1) within the meaning of section \n856(c)(3)(C).  \nFacts\nTaxpayer is a limited partnership organized in State and is classified as a \npartnership for federal income tax purposes.  Taxpayer reports its income under the \naccrual method of accounting and its tax year ends December 31.\nTaxpayer and Sponsor intend to engage in a roll-up transaction whereby a \ncorporation or trust (\u201cNewco\u201d) will be formed that will elect and qualify as a real estate \ninvestment trust (\u201cREIT\u201d) for federal income tax purposes.  Taxpayer will serve as the \noperating partnership and will originate and own Transactions, which will be the only \nassets it owns other than property specifically permitted under section 856.\nTaxpayer invests in the potential long-term growth of residential real estate \nthrough Transactions.  Taxpayer is capitalized through capital contributions from \ninvestors and such capital contributions are used to fund and originate Transactions.  \nTaxpayer offers the Transaction to residential Property owners (\u201cHomeowners\u201d) \nbetween the ages of A and B.  Transactions are designed as an alternative to traditional \nmortgage loans.  Under a Transaction, participating Homeowners are paid an upfront \npayment (\u201cUpfront Payment\u201d) and in exchange grant to Taxpayer the right (the \n\u201cParticipation Right\u201d) to participate in the future growth in the value of the underlying \nproperty (\u201cProperty\u201d).  Taxpayer is unable to definitively determine the full income effect \nof the transaction until a future event (\u201cTrigger Event\u201d).\nThe Transaction begins with the submission of an application by an interested \nHomeowner.  Upon receipt of an application, Taxpayer performs a review and \nunderwrites the proposed transaction.  Based upon factors such as the value of the \nProperty (\u201cInitial Property Value\u201d), existing mortgage loans on the Property, location and \nother underwriting criteria, Taxpayer either approves or declines the Transaction.  \nBecause a Transaction is an asset-based transaction, the underwriting process is \nkeenly focused on the value of the Property.  If the application is approved, Taxpayer \nissues a proposed offer sheet that lists the Upfront Payment available to the \nHomeowner.  Upfront Payment amounts are a percentage of the Initial Property Value.  \nEach Upfront Payment has a corresponding Appreciation Participation Rate.  \n\u201cAppreciation Participation Rate\u201d is the rate at which Taxpayer and the Homeowner \nparticipate in the appreciation, if any, of the Property.  Appreciation Participation Rates \nrange in value depending on the Upfront Payment paid to the Homeowner.  \nHomeowners select the Upfront Payment they desire, as well as the corresponding \nAppreciation Participation Rate they are comfortable providing to Taxpayer.  The \namount paid to a Homeowner for an Upfront Payment is not required to be repaid, \nexcept in the event a Trigger Event terminates a Transaction within D years.\nPLR-123109-11\n3\nTrigger Events under the Transaction are: (i) an uncured breach by the \nHomeowner of the Participation Right Agreement (e.g. default on the primary mortgage \nloan, or failure to maintain insurance or pay utilities, taxes, etc.,); (ii) the sale/transfer of \nthe Property, including a transfer that results from the death of the Homeowner; or (iii) C \nyears from the origination of the Participation Right (or sooner based upon states\u2019 rules \nagainst perpetuity laws).  Upon a Trigger Event, Taxpayer is entitled to exercise its \nrights under the Participation Right Agreement and receive a cash settlement amount \nof: (i) the Early Termination Charge (as defined below) if the Participation Right \nAgreement is terminated by a Trigger Event within the first D years; or, (ii) its share of \nappreciation, if any, based upon the Appreciation Participate Rate (the \u201cSettlement \nAmount\u201d).\nTransactions are intended to be long-term transactions.  It is anticipated the \nmajority of the Transactions will mature (or become exercisable) at a period of greater \nthan D years.  In the event a Trigger Event terminates a Transaction within the first D \nyears from its origination, an Early Termination Charge applies.  Under a Transaction, \nthe \u201cEarly Termination Charge\u201d equals the greater of: (i) the amount paid by Taxpayer to \noriginate the Participation Right, which equals the Upfront Payment plus its origination \ncost (collectively, the \u201cParticipation Right Cost\u201d), plus interest on the Participation Right \nCost at an annual compounding rate of D percent or, (ii) Taxpayer\u2019s share of \nappreciation at the time of termination.\nAppreciation under a Transaction is measured by the Index that covers the \nmetropolitan area in which the Property is located.  At the time the Transaction is \noriginated, the value of the Index is used as the \u201cBeginning Index Value.\u201d  At the end of \nthe Transaction, the value of the Index at that time establishes the \u201cEnding Index \nValue.\u201d  If the Ending Index Value is greater than the Beginning Index Value, the \npercentage increase is used to calculate the appreciation of the Property.\nThe Index is used to measure appreciation (as opposed to an appraisal) due to \nefficiency, transparency and fairness concerns.  Using the Index, for example, prevents \na potential dispute concerning accuracy and the added expense of additional back-end \nappraisals.  In addition, in the event the Homeowner improves the Property and the \nimprovement results in an increase in value to the Property, Taxpayer is entitled to only \nthe amount owed as determined by the Index regardless of the increased value from the \nimprovements.  Finally, the Index adds an element of objectivity and transparency for \nthe Homeowner participating in a Transaction. \nTransactions are secured by a performance mortgage (or performance deed of \ntrust, depending on state requirements) recorded against the subject Property\u2019s title.  \nAdditionally, Taxpayer records a memorandum of option on the Property\u2019s title to \nprovide public notice of an interest in the Property.  Each performance mortgage is a \nlien against the Property, and Taxpayer is the mortgagee, with all rights and privileges, \nPLR-123109-11\n4\nunder the mortgage.  The performance mortgage is intended to secure the \nHomeowner\u2019s performance under the Transaction.  No stated sum certain is listed in the \nperformance mortgage due to the uncertainty of the Transaction.\nAs described above, Taxpayer makes an Upfront Payment to a Homeowner and \nin exchange receives the right to share in the potential future appreciation of the \nProperty.  Taxpayer records a performance mortgage against the Property to secure \nand provide notice of its interest in the Property.  At the end of the Transaction, \nTaxpayer is entitled to either: (i) the Early Termination Charge (if applicable); or (ii) its \nshare of appreciation, if any, which is gain from the sale or disposition of the Property \nsecured by the mortgage.  Appreciation is calculated using the Index described above. \nIf the Transaction ends after D years from the date of its origination and there is no \nappreciation, Taxpayer is not entitled to any payment.  In this case, the Homeowner \nkeeps the Upfront Payment and Taxpayer suffers a loss on its investment in the \nProperty.  \nLaw and Analysis\nSection 856(c)(5)(B) of the Code defines the term \u201creal estate assets\u201d, in part, to \nmean real property (including interests in real property and interests in mortgages on \nreal property) and shares (or transferable certificates of beneficial interest) in other \nREITs.  Section 856(c)(5)(C) provides that the term \u201cinterests in real property\u201d includes \nfee ownership and co-ownership of land or improvements thereon, leaseholds of land or \nimprovements thereon, options to acquire land or improvements thereon, and options to \nacquire leaseholds of land or improvements thereon, but does not include mineral, oil, \nor gas royalty interests.\nSection 856(c)(3) provides that, to qualify as a REIT for any taxable year under \npart II of subchapter M, an entity must derive at least 75 percent of its gross income \n(excluding gross income from prohibited transactions) from sources listed in section \n856(c)(3), which also includes gain from the sale or other disposition of real property \n(including interests in real property and interests in mortgages on real property) which is \nnot property described in section 1221(a)(1). \nSection 1.856-3(b)(1) of the Income Tax Regulations (the \u201cRegulations\u201d) provides \nthat the term \u201creal estate assets\u201d means real property, interests in mortgages on real \nproperty (including interests in mortgages on leaseholds of land or other improvements \nthereon), and shares in other qualified REITs.  Section 1.856-3(c) provides that \n\"interests in real property\" includes fee ownership and co-ownership of land or \nimprovements thereon, leaseholds of land or improvements thereon, options to acquire \nland or improvements thereon, and options to acquire leaseholds of land or \nimprovements thereon. \nPLR-123109-11\n5\nUnder section 1.856-3(g) of the Regulations, a REIT that is a partner in a \npartnership is deemed to own its proportionate share of each of the assets of the \npartnership and to be entitled to the income of the partnership attributable to that share. \nFor purposes of section 856, the interest of a partner in the partnership's assets is \ndetermined in accordance with the partner's capital interest in the partnership.  The \ncharacter of the various assets in the hands of the partnership and items of gross \nincome of the partnership retain the same character in the hands of the partners for all \npurposes of section 856. \nIn the instant case, the Transaction is secured by a performance mortgage (or \nperformance deed of trust) recorded against the subject Property\u2019s title.  As described \nabove, each performance mortgage is a lien against the Property with all rights and \nprivileges under the mortgage.  The Transaction arises through an agreement between \nTaxpayer and Homeowner with respect to real property.  In addition to authorizing the \nTransaction, the Homeowner enters into the Participation Right Agreement and a \nperformance mortgage (or performance deed of trust) for the benefit of Taxpayer in \nexchange for the Upfront Payment.  The Participation Right Agreement and \nperformance mortgage (or performance deed of trust) attach an interest on the real \nproperty securing the Participation Right.  Accordingly, a Transaction is secured by an \ninterest in the underlying real property.  To the extent a Transaction is fully secured by \nreal property, it qualifies as a real estate asset within the meaning of sections 856(c)(4) \nand 856(c)(5)(B).  In addition, when a Transaction is terminated and the Taxpayer \nreceives an Early Termination Charge or its share of appreciation of the Property, if any, \nsuch amount is gain from the sale or other disposition of real property (including \ninterests in real property and interests in mortgages on real property) which is not \nproperty described in section 1221(a)(1) within the meaning of section 856(c)(3)(C). \nConclusion\nBased on the facts as represented by Taxpayer, we rule that, to the extent a \nTransaction is fully secured by real property, it qualifies as a real estate asset within the \nmeaning of sections 856(c)(4) and 856(c)(5)(B).  In addition, we rule that gross income \nrealized by Taxpayer under a Transaction constitutes gain from the sale or other \ndisposition of real property (including interests in real property and interests in \nmortgages on real property) which is not property described in section 1221(a)(1) within \nthe meaning of section 856(c)(3)(C). \nExcept as specifically ruled upon above, no opinion is expressed concerning any \nfederal income tax consequences relating to the facts herein under any other provision \nof the Code. Specifically, we do not rule whether Newco otherwise will qualify as a REIT \nunder part II of subchapter M of Chapter 1 of the Code.\nPLR-123109-11\n6\nThis ruling is directed only to the taxpayer requesting it.  Taxpayer and Newco \nshould attach a copy of this ruling to each tax return to which it applies.  Section \n6110(k)(3) of the Code provides that it may not be used or cited as precedent.\nSincerely,\nThomas M. Preston\nThomas M.

PT\u2019s Exchange\nPT engaged in a deferred like-kind exchange through a qualified intermediary (QI) and a \nqualified trustee (QT) under an exchange agreement and a qualified exchange trust \nagreement.1  On Date 1, PT (by its wholly-owned LLC#1), pursuant to the exchange \nagreement and a prior sales agreement, conveyed RQ by direct deed to Unrelated \nBuyer for $x.  \nOn Date 2, PT timely identified replacement property (RP) as a potential replacement \nproperty for RQ, along with two other potential replacement properties.  RP was owned \n                                           \n1 The term \u201cqualified exchange trust agreement\u201d as used in this letter is the type of trust agreement \ndescribed in \u00a7 1.1031(k)-1(g)(3)(iii) of the Income Tax Regulations.  Taxpayer describes specific steps in \nthese combined transactions, including Taxpayers entering into exchange agreements, qualified \nexchange trust agreements, assignments, notices of assignments, etc., and represents that PT, Affiliate \nand Related Party are meeting all requirements for deferral in these transactions under the safe harbor \nrules of the regulations and other relevant published guidance.  Since these steps are not directly relevant \nto the rulings sought by Taxpayer, this letter will not describe them with the same amount of detail given \nin Taxpayer\u2019s ruling application.    \nPLR-134451-11\n3\nby Affiliate through its wholly-owned limited liability company, Affiliate LLC, a \ndisregarded entity for federal income tax purposes.\nOn Date 3, PT timely acquired RP when it acquired from Affiliate 100 percent of the \nmembership interest of Affiliate LLC for $y, an amount exceeding the sales price of RQ.\nB. Affiliate\u2019s Exchange \nAffiliate entered into an exchange agreement and a qualified exchange trust agreement \nto facilitate the exchange of RP (Affiliate RQ) for like-kind replacement property (Affiliate \nRP).  At the closing of the transfer of RP (which was Affiliate RQ) to PT, the net \nproceeds were received by Affiliate\u2019s QI and QT.  On Date 4, Affiliate timely identified \nthree properties as potential replacement properties for Affiliate RQ.  One of these \nidentified properties is held by Related Party.  \nIf Affiliate acquires Affiliate RP at a cost that is less than the amount realized on the \ndisposition of Affiliate RQ, the difference will result in Affiliate recognizing gain equal to \nthe difference.  However, Affiliate represents that the amount of gain Affiliate will have to \nrecognize as a result of acquiring Affiliate RP for less than the amount realized for \nAffiliate RQ will not exceed 5 percent of the gain realized by Affiliate on its disposition of \nAffiliate RQ.  \nC. Additional Related Party Exchanges\nTo the extent any Affiliate RP is acquired from Related Party, prior to transfer of such \nproperty to Affiliate, Related Party will enter into a deferred exchange agreement with a \nQI providing for the Related Party\u2019s exchange of Affiliate RP that it transfers to Affiliate. \nThus the Affiliate RP to be transferred by Related Party will be Related Party\u2019s \nrelinquished property (Related Party RQ).  \nBefore the expiration of the statutory identification period, Related Party will identify \npotential replacement properties (Related Party RP).  All potential Related Party RP will \nbe owned by parties unrelated to PT, Affiliate and Related Party.  Related Party will \nacquire ownership of some or all of the potential Related Party RP within the \nreplacement period provided in \u00a7 1031(a)(3)(B).\nIf Related Party acquires Related Party RP through a QI at a cost that is less than the \namount realized on the disposition of Related Party RQ, the difference will result in \nRelated Party recognizing gain equal to the difference.  However, Related Party \nrepresents that the amount of gain Related Party will have to recognize will not exceed \n5 percent of the gain realized by Related Party on its disposition of the Related Party \nRQ.  \n  \nPLR-134451-11\n4\nPT, Affiliate and Related Party receiving replacement properties from related parties in \nthe series of exchanges described in this letter will hold their replacement properties for \nat least two years following the date of the acquisition of the last property acquired by \nany of the parties in these described transactions.\nAPPLICABLE LAW & ANALYSIS:\nApplication of \u00a7 1031(f)\nSection 1031(a)(1) of the Code provides that no gain or loss is recognized on the \nexchange of property held for productive use in a trade or business or for investment if \nthe property is exchanged solely for property of like kind to be held either for productive \nuse in a trade or business or for investment.\nSection 1031(f)(1) provides that if--(A) a taxpayer exchanges property with a related \nperson, (B) there is nonrecognition of gain or loss to the taxpayer under \u00a7 1031 on the \nexchange of such property (determined without regard to \u00a7 1031(f)), and (C) before the \ndate 2 years after the date of the last transfer that was part of the exchange\u2014\n   (i) the related person disposes of the property, or \n   (ii) the taxpayer disposes of the property received in the exchange from the related \nperson that was of like kind to the property transferred by the taxpayer, \nthere is no nonrecognition of gain or loss under \u00a7 1031 to the taxpayer on the \nexchange.  Any gain or loss recognized by the taxpayer by reason of \u00a71031(f) must be \ntaken into account as of the date on which the disposition referred to in (C) occurs. \nSection 1031(f)(2)(C) provides that, for purposes of the application of \u00a7 1031(f)(1)(C),  a \ndisposition is not taken into account if it is established to the satisfaction of the \nSecretary that neither the exchange nor the disposition had as one of its principal \npurposes the avoidance of federal income tax.    \nSection 1031(f)(4) provides that \u00a7 1031 does not apply to any exchange that is part of a \ntransaction (or series of transactions) structured to avoid the purposes of \u00a7 1031(f). \nSection 1031(f)(1) is not applicable to PT\u2019s exchange of RQ for RP because PT is \nexchanging property with QI, who is not a related person to PT.  The same is true of the \nseparate exchanges of Affiliate and Related Party.  However, under \u00a7 1031(f)(4), if PT \n(or Affiliate or Related Party) is using a QI or EAT to structure its transactions with tax \navoidance as one of its principal purposes, \u00a7 1031 will not apply to the exchange.  See, \ne.g., Teruya Brothers Ltd. v. Commissioner, 580 F.3d 1038 (9th Cir. 2009); Ocmulgee \nFields v. Commissioner, 613 F.3d1360 (11th Cir. 2010); and Rev. Rul. 2002-83, 2002-2 \nC.B. 927.\nPLR-134451-11\n5\nBoth the House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee \ndisclosed the policy concern that led to the enactment of \u00a7 1031(f):\nBecause a like-kind exchange results in the substitution of the basis of the \nexchanged property for the property received, related parties have \nengaged in like-kind exchanges of high basis property for low basis \nproperty in anticipation of the sale of the low basis property in order to \nreduce or avoid the recognition of gain on the subsequent sale.  Basis \nshifting also can be used to accelerate a loss on the retained property.  \nThe committee believes that if a related party exchange is followed shortly \nthereafter by a disposition of the property, the related parties have, in \neffect, cashed out of the investment, and the original exchange should not \nbe accorded nonrecognition treatment.  \nH.R. Rep. No. 247, 101st Cong., 1st Sess., 1340 (1989); S. Print. No. 56, at 151 (1989).  \nThe Senate Finance Committee Print, however, also gives three examples of fact \nsituations for which it is deemed established for purposes of \u00a7 1031(f)(2(C) that neither \nthe exchange nor such disposition had as one of its principal purposes the avoidance of \nfederal income tax.  One of the three involves \u201c. . . dispositions of property in \nnonrecognition transactions.\u201d   S. Print. No. 56, 152.  \nIn the present case, the only acquisitions of replacement property from related entities \nwill be as part of subsequent like-kind exchanges by these related entities, which will \nsubstantially constitute nonrecognition transactions.  Affiliate will be relinquishing \nproperty to PT as part of its own like-kind exchange with Related Party and Related \nParty will relinquish property to Affiliate as part of its separate like-kind exchange for \nreplacement property from one or more unrelated parties.  Since both Affiliate and \nRelated Party are also structuring their respective dispositions of property as exchanges \nfor like-kind replacement property, neither \u00a7 1031(f)(1) nor (f)(4) will apply to trigger gain \nrecognition in PT\u2019s exchanges or to disqualify the application of \u00a7 1031 to any exchange \nin this series of transactions.  \nFurthermore, there is no material cashing out by any of the related parties within 2 years \nof the last transfer in the series of transactions because neither Taxpayer, Affiliate nor \nRelated Party will receive non-like-kind replacement property greater than 5 percent of \nthe gain realized on disposition of relinquished property.  Upon completion of the series \nof transactions, all related parties will own the properties received in these exchanges \nthat are of like kind to the properties exchanged for at least two years after the date of \nthe last transfer in the series. \nApplication of the identification and replacement period rules\nPLR-134451-11\n6\nSection 1031(a)(3) provides that for purposes of \u00a7 1031(a), any property received by the \ntaxpayer is treated as not like-kind property if\u2014\n     (A) the property is not identified as property to be received in the exchange on or \nbefore the day which is 45 days after the date on which the taxpayer transfers the \nproperty relinquished in the exchange, or \n     (B) the property is received after the earlier of\u2014\n           (i) the day which is 180 days after the date on which the taxpayer transfers the \nproperty relinquished in the exchange, or \n          (ii) the due date (determined with regard to extension) for the transferor\u2019s return of \nthe tax imposed by this chapter for the taxable year in which the transfer of the \nrelinquished property occurs. \nSection 1.1031(k)-1(c)(4) provides rules limiting the number and the fair market value of \npotential replacement properties that exchanging taxpayers may identify prior to their \nreceipt of replacement property.  \nIn the present case, PT, Affiliate and Related Party represent that they are separate \ntaxpayers that will separately report the results of any exchange, including the \nrealization and recognition of gain or loss on the dispositions.  Thus, each must be \nregarded as undertaking its own exchange transaction with an identification and \nreplacement period that would apply separately to that party\u2019s exchange.  Thus, for \nexample, Date 1 would be the day on which PT\u2019s 45-day identification period would \nbegin, whereas Affiliate\u2019s identification period would begin when Affiliate transfers its \nRQ and Related Party\u2019s identification period begins when Related Party transfers its \nRQ.  Similarly, each party would separately apply the limits on identification of multiple \nor alternative properties under \u00a71.1031(k)-1(c)(4).\nRULINGS: \n1. Section 1031(f)(1) and (f)(4) of the Code do not apply to disqualify PT from the \nbenefits of \u00a7 1031(a) in its exchanges with related parties provided that (A) each \nrelated party transferring replacement property into the exchanges described in this \nletter is also engaging in its own like-kind exchange and (B) PT, Affiliate and Related \nParty hold their replacement properties for at least two years after the date of the \nlast transfer of property in the exchanges.\n2. Receipt by Affiliate or Related Party of non-like-kind property equal to no more \nthan 5 percent of the gain realized by Affiliate or Related Party, respectively, in its \nexchange will not result in the application of \u00a7 1031(f) to PT in its exchange.  \n3. Each transfer of relinquished property by PT, Affiliate or Related Party in its \nseparate exchange will result in a separate identification period and replacement \nPLR-134451-11\n7\nperiod provided in \u00a7 1031(a)(3) commencing on the date of the respective party\u2019s \ninitial transfer of relinquished property.  \n4.  Each transfer of relinquished property by PT, Affiliate or Related Party in its \nseparate exchange will result in a separate application of the limits on identification \nof multiple or alternative replacement properties provided in \u00a71.1031(k)-1(c)(4).\nCAVEATS:\nExcept as expressly provided herein, no opinion is expressed or implied concerning the \ntax consequences of any aspect of any transaction or item discussed or referenced in \nthis letter.
